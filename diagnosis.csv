Based on the recent international recommendation to standardize the evaluation method, the clinical validity and utility of TILs in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were investigated in the present study.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"PATIENTS AND METHODS\">TILs were evaluated in 177 patients with BC treated with NAC and subsequent curative surgery. The correlation between TILs evaluated according to the standard method and prognosis, including the efficacy of NAC, was investigated retrospectively.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">In the high-TIL group (n=96) compared to the low-TIL group (n=81), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p&lt;0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched breast cancer (HER2BC) (p=0.040) were significantly more frequent, and the pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher (p=0.003). Among patients with TNBC and those with HER2BC, the pCR rate was significantly higher in the high-TIL group than in the low-TIL group (p=0.013 and p=0.014, respectively). Multivariable analysis also showed that high-TIL status was an independent factor predicting favorable prognosis (hazard ratio(HR)=0.24, p=0.023 and HR=0.13, p=0.036). Biopsy specimens from local recurrence after successful NAC frequently showed TILs decreased.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\">TILs may be a biomarker for predicting treatment response to NAC in patients with TNBC and HER2BC. A decrease in TILs may also be associated with tumor recurrence.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and survival outcome.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics, relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127 patients with BC.

The risk factors of primary lung cancer following breast cancer were analyzed using logistic regression model. <b>Results:</b> Second primary lung cancer in patients with first breast cancer accounted for approximately 21.2%(55/260) of pulmonary malignant solitary nodules, and 0.84%(55/6 580) of all breast cancer patients. The median intervals between the diagnosis of second primary lung cancer or lung metastasis and first breast cancer were 52 months and 42 months, respectively. These two groups showed significant difference between age, time interval between diagnoses, breast tumor size, axillary lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor, molecular subtype (luminal B and triple-negative) and history of radiotherapy (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05 for all). A multivariate logistic regression model confirmed that age (<i>OR</i>=1.088, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), breast tumor size(<i>OR</i>=0.480, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and radiotherapy history (<i>OR</i>=3.460, <i>P</i>=0.004) were all independent factors for second primary lung cancer. <b>Conclusions:</b> For isolated pulmonary nodules in patients with breast cancer, especially for those with elder age, larger tumor size and radiotherapy history, we should distinguish the second primary lung cancer from pulmonary metastasis. The treatment regimen for lung metastasis and primary lung cancer in patients with breast cancer are entirely distinct. The timely histopathology examinations for pulmonary nodes in patients with breast cancer are recommended.</AbstractText>\n"
"29559048","2018/03/22 06:00","Who Is Ordering MRIs in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients?","<AbstractText>The role of MRI in the workup of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients remains controversial. Breast MRI detects additional disease, but this has not translated into improved outcomes. In light of a dramatic rise in MRI use, we investigated patterns of MRI ordering for newly diagnosed breast cancer. All newly diagnosed breast cancer cases presenting for surgical management to a specialized breast center from 2011 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients who had an MRI ordered by their operating surgeon were compared with those who had an MRI completed previously. Of 1037 patients, 504 (49%) with newly diagnosed breast cancer underwent MRI as part of their preoperative evaluation. Variables associated with MRI use included commercial insurance, increased breast density, genetic testing, mamographically occult disease, and lobular pathology. Of women who presented to our center with an MRI already completed, 63 per cent were ordered by a primary care provider. Of the 504 patients, 233 (44%) who had an MRI underwent an additional biopsy, and 166 (33%) had a resultant change in management. There was no significant difference in MRI-directed change in patient care depending on ordering provider. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for preoperative MRI evaluation to optimize patient outcomes.</AbstractText>\n"

According to the 21 gene RS, the patients were divided into low risk (295 cases), intermediate risk (111 cases) and high-risk (33 cases) group. The relationship between the 21 gene RS and clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, recurrence and metastasis was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to analyze the risk factors for relapse free survival (RFS). <b>Results:</b> Tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 index were significantly different among the 3 risk cohorts (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001 for all). After a median follow-up of 32 months, the recurrence rate in low risk group (3.7%) was significantly lower than that in the intermediate-high risk group (9.0%), the locoregional recurrence (LRR) rate of low, intermediate and high risk group was 2.4%, 6.3% and 9.1%; and the distant metastasis (DM) rate in low risk group was 1.4% and 2.1% in the intermediate-high risk group. Univariate analysis showed RS, ER status and endocrine therapy were prognostic factors for RFS (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05 for all). Multivariate analysis showed that RS was an independent significant predictor for RFS (<i>P</i>=0.04). <b>Conclusions:</b> The 21-gene RS is related to tumor grade, ER, PR and Ki-67 index. RS is an independent risk factor for RFS in patients with hormone receptor positive early-stage breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

AMTB decreased viable cell number in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines (30 and 100 μM), and also reduced the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (30 μM). However, these effects were independent of TRPM8, as no TRPM8 mRNA was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells. AMTB was identified as an inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-1.9 were expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines, with Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 mRNA highest in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the other breast cancer cell lines assessed.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"SIGNIFICANCE\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">TRPM8 levels may be elevated in basal breast cancers, however, TRPM8 expression appears to be lost in many breast cancer cell lines.

Women who had recently completed treatment for primary breast cancer (n = 507) were randomly assigned to three 20 min. home-based writing exercises, one week apart, focusing on emotional disclosure (EWI) of a distressing experience (their cancer or a non-cancer topic) or a non-disclosing topic (control). Outcomes were self-reported physical symptoms and healthcare utilization (visits and telephone contacts with GP) 3 and 9 months post-intervention. Potential moderators were repressive coping, alexithymia, rumination, social constraints, and writing topic. Results revealed no group by time interaction effects for any outcomes. Moderation analyses showed that 1) low alexithymic women in the EWI group showed larger decreases in GP telephone calls over time than both high alexithymic women and controls and 2) women in the EWI group writing about their own cancer, but not women writing about other topics, showed a larger decrease than controls. The results from this large randomized trial are concordant with previous findings showing that EWI is unlikely to be a generally applicable intervention to improve health-related outcomes in cancer patients and cancer survivors. However, written disclosure might have a beneficial impact for individuals who write about their own cancer, as well as for those low in alexithymia.</AbstractText>\n"

Monoclonal antibodies directed against the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) provides durable disease control, particularly in melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder and head and neck cancers. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current data on the expression of PD-L1 in breast cancer and on the preliminary clinical results of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer patients. In breast cancer, PD-L1 expression is heterogeneous and is generally associated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the presence of poor-prognosis factors, such as young age, high grade, ER-negativity, PR-negativity, and HER-2 overexpression, high proliferative index, and aggressive molecular subtypes (triple negative, basal-like, HER-2-overexpressing). Its prognostic value remains controversial when assessed with immunohistochemistry, whereas it seems favorable in triple-negative cancers when assessed at the mRNA level. Early clinical trials with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer have shown efficacy in terms of tumor response and/or disease control in refractory metastatic breast cancers, notably in the triple-negative subtype. Many trials are currently underway, both in the metastatic and neo-adjuvant setting. A crucial issue is identification of biomarkers predictive of response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Société Française du Cancer.

The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic women, despite racial differences.</AbstractText>\n"

Commercial analysis of the BRCA1/2 genes has been available since 1996, and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is well established. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines identify individuals for whom BRCA1/2 analysis is appropriate and define management recommendations for mutation carriers. Despite recommendations, not all who meet NCCN criteria undergo genetic testing. We assess the frequency that individuals meeting NCCN criteria decline BRCA1/2 analysis, as well as factors that affect the decision-making process. A retrospective chart review was performed from September 2013 through August 2014 of individuals who received genetic counseling at the Levine Cancer Institute. A total of 1082 individuals identified through the retrospective chart review met NCCN criteria for BRCA1/2 analysis. Of these, 267 (24.7%) did not pursue genetic testing. Of the Nontested cohort, 59 (22.1%) were disinterested in testing and 108 (40.4%) were advised to gather additional genetic or medical information about their relatives before testing. The remaining 100 (37.5%) individuals were insured and desired to undergo genetic testing but were prohibited by the expense. Eighty five of these 100 patients were responsible for the total cost of the test, whereas the remaining 15 faced a prohibitive copay expense. Financial concerns are a major deterrent to the pursuit of BRCA1/2 analysis among those who meet NCNN criteria, especially in patients diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. These findings highlight the need to address financial concerns for genetic testing in this high-risk population.</AbstractText>\n"

Recently, RIP2 has been linked to chemoresistance of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer subtype for which there is an urgent need for targeted therapies. In this study we show that high expression of RIP2 in breast tumors correlates with a worse prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence. We also demonstrate that RIP2 confers TNBC cell resistance against paclitaxel and ceramide-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of RIP2 lead to NF-κB activation, which contributed to higher expression of pro-survival proteins and cell survival. Conversely, RIP2 knockdown inhibited NF-κB signaling, reduced levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and sensitized cells to drug treatment. Together, these data show that RIP2 promotes survival of breast cancer cells through NF-κB activation and that targeting RIP2 may be therapeutically beneficial for treatment of TNBC.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018.

The search for a high quality ensemble is directed by a fitness function that incorporates the accuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself. The ensemble approach is tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets, one on Breast Cancer and two on Parkinson's disease, using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. Our experimental results show that, for the first dataset, the performance was similar to previous studies reported in literature. On the second dataset, the Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous methods.

Various nucleic acid delivery systems have been developed, each with its own advantages and limitations. We previously developed a nanoparticle-based delivery system for small chemical drugs using pH-responsive PEG<sub>8</sub>-PDPA<sub>100</sub>-PEG<sub>8</sub> polymer micelles as carriers. In this study, we extend the application of these pH-responsive micelle-like nanoparticles (MNPs) to deliver oligonucleotides. We demonstrate that the MNPs efficiently encapsulate and deliver oligonucleotides of different lengths (20-100 nt) into cells. The cargo oligonucleotides are rapidly released at pH 5.0. We prepared MNPs carrying a Texas red-fluorescently labeled anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) aptamer (HApt). Compared to free HApt, the HApt-MNPs resulted in significantly better cellular uptake, reduced cell viability, and increased apoptosis in SKBR3 breast cancer cells, which overexpress HER2. Moreover, HApt-MNPs were significantly less cytotoxic to MCF7 breast cancer cells, which express low levels of HER2. After cellular uptake, HApt-MNPs mainly accumulated in lysosomes; inhibition of lysosomal activity using bafilomycin A1 and LysoTracker Red staining confirmed that lysosomal activity and low pH were required for HApt-MNP accumulation and release. Furthermore, HER2 protein expression declined significantly following treatment with HApt-MNPs in SKBR3 cells, indicating that HApt-induced translocation of HER2 to lysosomes exerted a potent cytotoxic effect by altering signaling downstream of HER2. In conclusion, this pH-responsive and lysosome-targeting nanoparticle system can efficiently deliver oligonucleotides to specific target cells and has significant potential for nucleic acid-based cancer therapies.</AbstractText>\n"

Previous research demonstrated that such drug resistance may be related to dysregulation of miRNA expression. Here, we found that knockdown of the long non-coding RNA, urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1), can promote the sensitivity of human breast cancer cells to trastuzumab. Mechanistically, UCA1 knockdown upregulated miR-18a and promoted miR-18a repression of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). A luciferase reporter assay confirmed the association of miR-18a with wild-type UCA1 but not with UCA1 mutated at the predicted miR-18a-binding site. The direct targeting of YAP1 by miR-18a was verified by the observation that miR-18a mimic suppressed luciferase expression from a construct containing the YAP1 3' untranslated region. Meanwhile, reciprocal repression of UCA1 and miR-18a were found to be Argonaute 2-dependent. Knockdown of YAP1 recapitulated the effect of UCA1 silencing by reducing the viability of trastuzumab-treated breast cancer cells, whereas inhibition of miR-18a abrogated UCA1 knockdown-induced improvement of trastuzumab sensitivity in breast cancer cells. These findings demonstrate that the UCA1/miR-18a/YAP1 axis plays an important role in regulating the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab, which has implications for the development of novel approaches to improving breast cancer responses to targeted therapy.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Accumulating evidence supports that KLF5 represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of basal TNBC. Our previous studies revealed that mifepristone is capable of suppressing TNBC cell proliferation and promoting cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting KLF5 expression. Nevertheless, its anticancer efficacy is only modest with high dose. Moreover, its main metabolite N-desmethyl mifepristone with the removal of one methyl moiety results in a significant loss of antiproliferative activity, indicating an important pharmacophore domain around this methyl moiety. To improve the pharmacokinetic properties including metabolic stability and enhance the anticancer activities, a focused compound library by altering this sensitive metabolic region of mifepristone has been designed and synthesized for scaffold repurposing and structural optimization.

However, all of them justify their use of it with the importance of expressing positive emotions such as hope to patients.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"DISCUSSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our findings confirm that there are divergent understandings of the concept of cure between oncologists and how they manage prognosis uncertainty. Medical language is thus influenced by scientific knowledge, but also by doctors' personal values and ways of thinking, perhaps influencing the doctor-patient relationship in turn. This exploratory study will be extended on a wider scale to explore the coexistence of other elements of diversity.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Société Française du Cancer.

The study enrolled 68 invasive lobular breast cancer patients, which represented 3.64% (68/1 870) of total invasive breast cancer. The median age of all selected patients was 46 years ranging from 36 to 83 years. All patients were restaged based on the 8(th) edition of AJCC cancer staging system and follow-up data including disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed to explore the prognostic determinants. The 5-year OS and DFS were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method; the significance of correlations between clinicopathological features and prognostic factors was estimated using log-rank test. <b>Results:</b> There were significant differences in OS between patients with different anatomic stage, prognostic stage, lymph node metastasis, progesterone receptor (PR) expression, lymphvascular invasion and perineural invasion (χ(2:) 4.318 to 32.394, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05); significant differences in DFS were also observed between patients with different anatomic stage, prognostic stage, lymph node metastasis, PR expression, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 expression, Ki-67 level, histological grade and lymphvascular invasion (χ(2:) 4.347 to 27.369, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Prognostic stages of 52.9% patients changed compared with anatomic stage, among which Luminal subtype mainly downstaged (22/30), however, triple negative subtype mainly upstaged (6/6). <b>Conclusions:</b> Anatomic stage, prognostic stage, lymph node metastasis, PR expression, lymphvascular invasion are the prognostic factors of invasive lobular breast cancer. Regard to invasive lobular breast cancer patients, clinicians should pay close attention to the differences between prognostic stage and anatomic stage.</AbstractText>\n"

A total of 17 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in pregnancy, the median age was 32 years (range from 25 to 45 years old), pathological staging revealed 2 patient with stage 0, 1 with stage Ⅱa, 7 with stage Ⅱb, 1 with stage Ⅲa, 2 with stage Ⅲc, 4 with stage Ⅳ. <b>Results:</b> Thirteen patients received surgical treatment in pregnancy, the gestational age at surgery was (27.7±4.6) weeks; 2 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ received mastectomy, 11 patients with breast cancer underwent modified radical mastectomy. In patients undergoing surgery during pregnancy, no prophylactic contractions were used in 4 patients who had been treated earlier, there were 2 patients with frequent contractions within 24 hours after operation in these patients. Follow-up 9 patients were given oral nifedipine to prevent contractions, no obvious contractions occurred after the operation. Seven patients received chemotherapy during pregnancy; the chemotherapy of 4 cases of triple negative breast cancer was weekly paclitaxel sequential epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, the chemotherapy of the other three patients was docetaxel sequential epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Fifteen patients underwent cesarean section to terminate pregnancy, 2 patients underwent spontaneous labor. The gestational age of birth was (36.9 ±1.3) weeks. Less than 35 weeks of termination of pregnancy occurred in one patient, the fetus was delivered to the neonatal intensive care unit due to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and suffered from congenital dysaudia. The prognosis of the other 16 survived infants was good. The median follow-up time was 10 months (range from 4 to 27) months, in 13 patients of stage 0 to Ⅲc, one patient were diagnosed with bone metastasis at 12 months after surgery, the remaining 12 patients had no disease progression, the progression free survival rate was 12/13, the overall survival rate was 13/13. Among the 4 patients with stage Ⅳ, one died in 7 months after delivery, one had new liver metastasis in 8 months after delivery. The remaining 2 patients were in stable condition. <b>Conclusions:</b> Breast cancer in pregnancy can be treated effectively, multidisciplinary cooperation and detailed assessment of maternal-fetal risks and benefits are necessary. Chemotherapy during pregnancy is safe for maternal-fetal, but it needed a large sample of clinical studies and long-term follow-up. The neonatal outcome was associated with gestational age, and therefore premature delivery was avoided as much as possible during treatment.</AbstractText>\n"

Peripheral blood is the most common sample. Urine, saliva, pleural effusion and ascites are also used. Now liquid biopsy is mainly used in the area of neoplasm diagnosis and treatment. Compared with traditional tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy is minimally invasive, convenient to sample and easy to repeat. Liquid biopsy mainly includes circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection. Detection of ctDNA requires sensitive and accurate methods. The progression of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and digital PCR promote the process of studies in ctDNA. In 2016, <i>Nature</i> published the result of whole-genome sequencing study of breast cancer. The study found 1 628 mutations of 93 protein-coding genes which may be driver mutations of breast cancer. The result of this study provided a new platform for breast cancer ctDNA studies. In recent years, there were many studies using ctDNA detection to monitor therapeutic effect and guide treatment. NGS is a promising technique in accessing genetic information and guiding targeted therapy. It must be emphasized that ctDNA detection using NGS is still at research stage. It is important to standardize ctDNA detection technique and perform prospective clinical researches. The time is not ripe for using ctDNA detection to guide large-scale breast cancer clinical practice at present.</AbstractText>\n"

Positive surgical margins, reexcision rates, and resection volumes were investigated.Of the total cohort, 124 patients underwent BCS with IUWLS and 90 patients with PWL. The following did not differ between the IUWLS and PWL groups: positive margin status, re-excision rate, conversion rate, permanent positive margin status, reoperation rate, median optimal resection volume (ORV), median total resection volume (TRV), and median closest tumor-free margin. Rather, median (range) widest tumor-free margin was significantly smaller in the IUWLS group (9 mm [5-12]) than in the PWL group (14 mm [9-20]; P = .003]). Median (range) calculated resection ratio (CRR) was significantly lower in the IUWLS group (1.67 [0.87-9.38]) than in the PWL group (4.83 [1.63-21.04]; P = .02).In nonpalpable breast cancer patients undergoing BCS, IUWLS showed positive resection margins and reexcision rates equivalent to those of the conventional PWL method. Additionally, excision volume and widest tumor-free margin were smaller with IUWLS, confirming that healthy breast tissue is less likely to be resected with this method. Our results suggest that IUWLS offers an excellent alternative to PWL, while avoiding PWL-induced patient discomfort.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In this work, we aim to determine TM4SF1 expression and its prognostic impact on patients with invasive breast cancer.Overall, we enrolled 209 invasive breast cancer patients and immunohistochemically examined the expression of TM4SF1 in tumor specimens. The relationship between TM4SF1 expression and clinicopathological parameter and patient survival of breast cancer patients was analyzed.Among the 209 cases, 137 (65.6%) exhibited high expression of TM4SF1. High TM4SF1 expression was significantly associated with advanced histological grade and negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors were more likely to express high levels of TM4SF1 than non-TNBC cases. Patients with high tumoral expression of TM4SF1 had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS; P = .00) and overall survival (OS; P = .01) than those with low expression of TM4SF1.

In the study of anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, DTX micelles showed better tumorgrowth inhibition than free DTX. The pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies showed that the DTX incorporated in micelles (especially in DTX-mPEG-PCL) retained significantly higher concentration in plasma and tumor tissue compared with free DTX. The acute toxicity and genotoxicity studies indicated that DTX micelles were safer than the docetaxel injection in cancer therapy and DTX-mPEG-PCL had less damage to DNA than DTX-mPEG-PLA.

Analysis of immediately postintervention follow-up values and change from baseline to end of intervention scores revealed that physical activity interventions resulted in significant small-to-moderate improvements in HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.57, 22 studies, 1996 women; SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17, 14 studies, 1459 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), emotional function (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32, 26 studies, 2102 women, moderate-quality evidence; SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.53, 15 studies, 1579 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), perceived physical function (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.49, 25 studies, 2129 women; SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.97, 13 studies, 1433 women, respectively; moderate-quality evidence), anxiety (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.19, 7 studies, 326 women; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.12, 4 studies, 235 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), and cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.58, 23 studies, 1265 women, moderate-quality evidence; SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.27, 9 studies, 863 women, respectively; very low-quality evidence).Investigators reported few minor adverse events.Small improvements in physical activity interventions were sustained for three months or longer postintervention in fatigue (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.26; SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.11, respectively), cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69; SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79, respectively), and self-reported physical activity (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.93, respectively) for both follow-up values and change from baseline scores.However, evidence of heterogeneity across trials was due to variation in intervention components (i.e. mode, frequency, intensity, duration of intervention and sessions) and measures used to assess outcomes. All trials reviewed were at high risk of performance bias, and most were also at high risk of detection, attrition, and selection bias. In light of the aforementioned issues, we determined that the evidence was of very low, low, or moderate quality.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">No conclusions regarding breast cancer-related and all-cause mortality or breast cancer recurrence were possible. However, physical activity interventions may have small-to-moderate beneficial effects on HRQoL, and on emotional or perceived physical and social function, anxiety, cardiorespiratory fitness, and self-reported and objectively measured physical activity. The positive results reported in the current review must be interpreted cautiously owing to very low-to-moderate quality of evidence, heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, imprecision of some estimates, and risk of bias in many trials. Future studies with low risk of bias are required to determine the optimal combination of physical activity modes, frequencies, intensities, and durations needed to improve specific outcomes among women who have undergone adjuvant therapy.</AbstractText>\n"

The use of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor 2) protein, in combination with chemotherapy improves survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. S-1, an oral combination of fluorouracil derivatives, is widely used in Japan and is more convenient than intravenous drugs. However, little is known about the combination of S-1 and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive MBC.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"PATIENTS AND METHODS\">We conducted a single-arm, open-label, multicenter prospective phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of an S-1 plus trastuzumab regimen for HER2-positive MBC.

We investigated its biodistribution using serial fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2 group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">The TTAC-10 group showed good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10 group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index in histopathologic analyses.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\">We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001 effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model.

Here we have constructed a targeted nano-system based on PEGylated poly (D, L-lactide) (PEG-PDLLA) using a novel ligand, CLKADKAKC (CK3) peptide, for active targeting to Neuropilin-1-rich breast cancer cells. CK3 increased the cellular uptake of micelles 4.7-fold compared with the free drug and nearly 2.2-fold compared with the unmodified micelles (PM), respectively. Furthermore, in vivo imaging revealed that CK3-modified micelles (CK3-PM) had excellent specific tumor cells targeting and the drug accumulation was also enhanced. When paclitaxel (PTX) was loaded into micelles, CK3-PM-PTX induced the strongest inhibition and apoptosis against MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrated that CK3-modified PEG-PDLLA micelles developed in this study could be a potential targeted vehicle for enhancing the chemotherapy of breast cancers.</AbstractText>\n"

The clinical and pathological characteristics of these patients were also included. <b>Results:</b> A total of 34 patients were enrolled. Among these patients, 24 patients underwent modified radical mastectomy and 18 of them had primary breast carcinoma in pathological sections. MRI detected 17 cases of primary lesions, including six masse lesions with a diameter of 0.6-1.2 cm (average 0.9 cm), and 11 non-mass lesions with four linear distributions, three segmental distributions, three focal distributions, and one regions distribution. Five patients had TIC typeⅠprimary lesions, ten had TIC type Ⅱ primary lesions, and two had TIC type Ⅲ primary lesions. Among all 34 cases, 23 of them had complete results of immunohistochemistry: 11 estrogen receptor (ER) positive lesions (47.8%), tenprogesterone receptor (PR) positive lesions (43.5%), seven human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive lesions (30.4%), and 20high expression(&gt;14%) of Ki-67 (87.0%).

Most of the patients with metastatic breast cancer have a hormone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative subtype with a median survival of more than 3 years. For these patients, endocrine therapy with its favorable toxicity profile is the current standard of care. However, patients with metastatic breast cancer have an incurable disease. Therefore, not only efficacy but also quality of life are key when selecting a therapy regimen. Areas covered: This paper aims to discuss the efficacy and toxicity profile of the new endocrine-based therapy option palbociclib together with endocrine treatment. Expert opinion: The addition of targeted agents like palbociclib can overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to endocrine therapy and substantially prolong progression free survival. The combination of palbociclib plus endocrine therapy is associated with a tolerable and well manageable toxicity profile as well as maintenance of quality of life. Thus, addition of palbociclib to endocrine therapy offers a new and important treatment option for hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Associations between polymorphisms of these genes, change in body mass index (BMI), and breast cancer risk were assessed by unconditional multivariable logistic regression models. The unconditional logistic regression model showed that persistent overweight (BMI ≥24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) over the preceding 10 years was associated with increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.35). No associations between LEPrs7799039, LEPRrs1137100, or LEPRrs1137101 polymorphisms alone and breast cancer risk were found. Persistent overweight over the preceding 10 years and carrying the LEPrs7799039 AA genotype together increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.26-3.16). Persistent overweight over the preceding 10 years and carrying the LEPRrs1137100 GG genotype increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.06-2.68). In premenopausal women, persistent overweight (BMI ≥24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) over the preceding 10 years increases breast cancer risk. Persistent overweight along with LEPrs7799039 AA or LEPRrs1137100 GG genotypes synergistically increase risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women.</AbstractText>\n"

Early-onset breast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast cancers in Asian populations, but the reason for this is unclear. We aimed to examine miRNA expression profiles in different age-onset groups and pathological subtypes in Asian breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">At the first stage, 10 samples (tumor: n = 6, normal tissue: n = 4) were analyzed with an Agilent microRNA 470 probe microarray. Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that were significantly altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 145 breast cancer samples at the second stage of the process. Correlations between clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients from different age groups and candidate miRNA expression were elucidated.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">In the present study, the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group, and an onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates.

In this study, we aimed at elucidating the prognostic value of the TGFβ isoforms and assessed their expression levels in breast cancer patients at different stages of the disease. We found higher levels of TGFβ1 and TGFβ3 in cancer patients compared to normal tissues, with no significant changes in TGFβ2 expression. Similarly, TGFβ1 and TGFβ3, but not TGFβ2, showed higher expression levels in advanced lymph node-positive and metastatic tumors, suggesting different roles for the different isoforms in tumor progression and the metastatic process, while in the least aggressive molecular subtype (luminal A), expression of the three TGFβ isoforms significantly correlated with expression of both TGFβ receptors, such correlation only occurred between TGFβ1 and TGFβ3 and the TGFβ type II receptor (TβRII) in the highly aggressive basal-like subtype. Interestingly, a distinct and somehow opposite pattern was observed in HER-2 tumors, only showing significant association pattern between TGFβ2 and the TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI). Finally, the three TGFβ isoforms showed distinct association patterns with patient outcome depending on the different molecular subtype, highlighting context-dependent, differential prognostic values.</AbstractText>\n"

In this work, we identified cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) as a novel target to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer. We demonstrated the increased transcriptional and translational expression of cPLA2α in breast cancer cells to acute and chronic exposure to doxorubicin. cPLA2α upregulation is also observed in breast cancer patients in response to chemotherapy. Inhibition of cPLA2α using two pharmacological inhibitors significantly enhances doxorubicin's effects to almost complete suppression in breast cancer cell growth, survival and migration. Similarly, depletion of cPLA2α significantly sensitizes breast cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment. We further found that cPLA2α inhibition led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, mTOR, S6 and 4EBP1, suggesting the suppression of ERK and mTOR signaling pathways. These findings indicate the positive roles of cPLA2α in breast cancer cell growth, survival, migration and response to chemotherapy. Our work also highlights the therapeutic value of blocking cPLA2α to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In spite of its clinical importance, assessment of Ki67 remains a challenge, as current manual scoring methods have high inter- and intra-user variability. A major reason for this variability is selection bias, in that different observers will score different regions of the same tumor. Here, we developed an automated Ki67 scoring method that eliminates selection bias, by using whole-slide analysis to identify and score the tumor regions with the highest proliferative rates. The Ki67 indices calculated using this method were highly concordant with manual scoring by a pathologist (Pearson's r = 0.909) and between users (Pearson's r = 0.984). We assessed the clinical validity of this method by scoring Ki67 from 328 whole-slide sections of resected early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. All patients had Oncotype DX testing performed (Genomic Health) and available Recurrence Scores. High Ki67 indices correlated significantly with several clinico-pathological correlates, including higher tumor grade (1 versus 3, P&lt;0.001), higher mitotic score (1 versus 3, P&lt;0.001), and lower Allred scores for estrogen and progesterone receptors (P = 0.002, 0.008). High Ki67 indices were also significantly correlated with higher Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence group (low versus high, P&lt;0.001). Ki67 index was the major contributor to a machine learning model which, when trained solely on clinico-pathological data and Ki67 scores, identified Oncotype DX high- and low-risk patients with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Automated scoring of Ki67 can thus successfully address issues of consistency, reproducibility and accuracy, in a manner that integrates readily into the workflow of a pathology laboratory. Furthermore, automated Ki67 scores contribute significantly to models that predict risk of recurrence in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Parameters of the model were derived from literatures. General principles related to cost-effectiveness analysis were used to compare the costs and effects of 12 different screening modalities in a simulated cohort involving 100 000 women aged 45 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to determine the most cost-effective modality. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how these factors affected the estimated cost-effectiveness. <b>Results:</b> The modality of biennial CBE followed by ultrasonic and mammography among those with positive CBE was observed as the most cost-effective one. The costs appeared as 182 526 Yuan RMB per life year gained and 144 386 Yuan RMB per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, which were within the threshold of 2-3 times of local per capita Gross Domestic Product. Results from sensitivity analysis showed that, due to higher incidence rate of breast cancer in Shanghai, the cost per QALY would be 64 836 Yuan RMB lower in Shanghai than the average level in China. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our research findings showed that the biennial CBE program followed by ultrasonic and mammography for those with positive CBE results might serve as the optimal breast cancer screening modality for Chinese women living in Shanghai, and thus be widely promoted in this population elsewhere.</AbstractText>\n"

They are highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. Based on the multiple-complexes generated pharmacophore models of PLK1 and homology models of EEF2K, the integrated virtual screening is performed to discover novel PLK1/EEF2K dual inhibitors. The top ten hit compounds are selected and tested in vitro, and five of them display PLK1 and EEF2K inhibition in vitro. Based on the docking modes of the most potent hit compound, a series of derivatives are synthesized, characterized and biological assayed on the PLK1, EEF2K as well as breast cancer cell proliferation models. Compound 18i with satisfied inhibitory potency are shifted to molecular mechanism studies contained molecular dynamics simulations, cell cycles, apoptosis and autophagy assays. Our results suggested that these novel PLK1/EEF2K dual inhibitors can be used as lead compounds for further development breast cancer chemotherapy.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Their clinical outcome was retrospectively reviewed and tumour samples collected from diagnostic core biopsies were analysed for progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki67 using immunohistochemistry.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">The commonest primary treatment was surgery (N = 194, 77%) followed by primary endocrine therapy (14.3%), primary radiotherapy (5.6%) and supportive treatment only (3.1%). Among the patients undergoing surgery, most of them had grade 3 (78.1%) and node-negative disease (62.2%). Some of them (21.1%) received postoperative radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 37.5 months, 117 patients had died, out of which 48.6% were due to breast cancer. For those who underwent surgery, the regional and local recurrence rates were 2% and 1.1% per annum respectively. For those who received primary endocrine therapy, 38% progressed at 6 months, however all patients who had primary radiotherapy achieved clinical benefit at 6 months. Regardless of treatment given, the 5-year breast cancer specific and overall survival rates were 70% and 50% respectively. Biological analysis based on good quality needle core biopsy specimensfrom181 patients showed that 26.8% (N = 49), 16.9% (N = 31) and 70.7% (N = 70)expressed positivity for PgR, HER2 and Ki67 respectively.

In our endeavour towards the development of novel anti-TNBC agents, herein we report a one-pot three-component synthesis of novel spirooxindoles 6a-p, and evaluation of their potential anti-proliferative activity towards TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells. Spirooxindoles 6a, 6e and 6i emerged as the most potent analogues with IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.70, 6.40 and 6.70 µM, respectively. Compounds 6a and 6e induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, as evidenced by the up-regulation of the Bax and down-regulation of the Bcl-2, besides boosting caspase-3 levels. Additionally, 6e displayed significant increase in the percent of annexin V-FITC positive apoptotic cells from 1.34 to 44%. Furthermore, spirooxindoles 6e and 6i displayed good inhibitory activity against EGFR (IC<sub>50</sub> = 120 and 150 nM, respectively).

Owing to surgery and bone metastasis, breast cancer patients were usually disturbed by persistent pain. However, the pain-relief-right has not been respected enough in clinical cancer treatment. Whether pain has any adverse effects on cancer development is still unclear. In order to uncover this question, we established two preclinical animal models to explore the effects of pain on the tumor. For the first model, we mimicked neuropathic pain by sciatic nerve ligation on rats with xenograft tumor subcutaneously. For the second model, we mimicked the bone cancer pain by injecting tumor cell suspension into the tibial medullary cavity of rats with xenograft tumor subcutaneously. The rats with persistent pain showed higher tumor volume and tumor weight compared with the group without pain. Interestingly, when the neuropathic pain and bone cancer pain were relieved by drug administration, both the tumor volume and tumor weight were lowered compared with the group without pain relief. In summary, our study indicated that persistent pain acted as a contributing factor to tumor growth. Moreover, the pain relief could weakened the accelerating role of pain in tumor growth. Thus, we should be paid more attention to the cancer patients with persistent pain as well as cancer treatment.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells. Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor (AR)-positive TNBC cells.

Oxidative stress induces stromal catabolism, which promotes cancer aggressiveness. Stromal cells exposed to oxidative stress release catabolites such as lactate, which are up-taken by cancer cells to support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The transfer of catabolites between stromal and cancer cells leads to metabolic heterogeneity between these cells and increased cancer cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in preclinical models. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress and reverses stromal catabolism and stromal-carcinoma cell metabolic heterogeneity, resulting in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of cancer cells in experimental models of breast cancer. The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine if NAC could reduce markers of stromal-cancer metabolic heterogeneity and markers of cancer cell aggressiveness in human breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">Subjects with newly diagnosed stage 0 and I breast cancer who were not going to receive neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection were treated with NAC before definitive surgery to assess intra-tumoral metabolic markers.

It is a heterogeneous disease featuring several different phenotypes with consistently different biological characteristics. Neuroligins are neural cell adhesion molecules that have been implicated in heterotopic cell adhesion. In humans, alterations in neuroligin genes are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases. Until recently, neuroligins have been shown to be abundantly expressed in blood vessels and also play a role implicated in the growth of glioma cells. Here we report increased expression of neuroligin 4X (NLGN4X) in breast cancer. We found NLGN4X was abundantly expressed in breast cancer tissues. NLGN4X expression data for all breast cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) was analyzed. Correlation between NLGN4X levels and clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed within Oncomine datasets. Evaluation of these bioinfomatic datasets results revealed that NLGN4X expression was higher in triple negative breast cancer cells, particularly the basal subtype and tissues versus non-triple-negative sets. Its level was also observed to be higher in metastatic tissues. RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence study of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells validated that NLGN4X was increased in MDA-MB-231. Knockdown of NLGN4X expression by siRNA decreased cell proliferation and migration significantly in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. NLGN4X knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by annexin staining, elevated caspase 3/7 and cleaved PARP by flow cytometry. High NLGN4X expression highly correlated with decrease in relapse free-survival in TNBC. NLGN4X might represent novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Inhibition of NLGN4X may be a new target for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Although Pasifika women have a lower incidence of breast cancer compared to New Zealand European women, they have higher breast cancer mortality and lower five-year survival. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and tumour biology of Pasifika women and to compare New Zealand European women to identify what factors impact on early (Stage 1 and 2) vs advanced stage (Stage 3 and 4) at diagnosis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHOD\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Data on all Pasifika and New Zealand European women diagnosed with breast cancer (C50) during the period 1 June 2000 to 31 May 2013 was extracted from the Auckland and Waikato Breast Cancer Registries. Descriptive tables and Chi-square test were used to examine differences in characteristics and tumour biology between Pasifika and New Zealand European women. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that contributed to an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">A significantly higher proportion of Pasifika women had advanced disease at diagnosis compared to New Zealand European women (33.3% and 18.3%, respectively). Cancer biology in Pasifika women was more likely to be: 1) HER2+, 2) ER/PR negative and 3) have a tumour size of ≥50mm. Pasifika women live in higher deprivation areas of 9-10 compared to New Zealand European women (55% vs 14%, respectively) and were less likely to have their cancer identified through screening. Logistic regression showed that if Pasifika women were on the screen-detected pathway they had similar odds (not sig.) of having advanced disease at diagnosis to New Zealand European women.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Mode of detection, deprivation, age and some biological factors contributed to the difference in odds ratio between Pasifika and New Zealand European women.

Most of these hybrids showed strong anticancer activities, among which 3-(3-(6-chloro-2-methoxyacridin-9-ylamino)propyl)-2-(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3-thiazinan-4-one (25; VR151) effectively killed many different cancer cell types, including eight breast cancer cell lines with different genetic background, two prostate cancer and two lung cancer cell lines. In contrast, compound 25 is less effective against non-cancer cells, suggesting it may be less toxic to humans. Our data showed that cancer cells are arrested in S phase for a prolonged period due to the down-regulation of DNA replication, leading to eventual cell death. We have also shown that the S phase arrest may be resulted by the down-regulation of cyclin A coupled with the continued up-regulation of cyclin E, which coincide with the down-regulation of mTor-S6K and mTor-4EBP1 pathways.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Due to cardiotoxicity and increasing resistance associated with trastuzumab, the first-line treatment, there is a need for effective second-line therapies in treating HER2-positive breast cancer. In this context, there has been increasing interest in the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of lapatinib plus capecitabine for HER2-positive breast cancer after progression with trastuzumab therapy, in comparison with capecitabine monotherapy and other agents such as vinorelbine and trastuzumab emtansine.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"MATERIALS AND METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We performed a keyword search in five electronic databases (OVID MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL; January 2010 to April 2017) for trials in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that has progressed on trastuzumab.

Platelet activity can be inferred by platelet volume indices (PVIs), which include platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width-to-platelet count ratio (PDW/P), and mean platelet volume-to-platelet count ratio. Platelets and platelet-related markers, such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, have been found to be significant prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer. However, the role of PVIs for predicting survival in breast cancer remains unknown; hence, we performed this retrospective analysis of 275 patients with breast cancer. PVIs were compared with clinicopathological variables, and were assessed to identify independent indicators associated with disease-free survival (DFS) using the Cox proportional hazards model. An elevated PDW/P significantly correlated with age and HER2 status. Univariate analysis revealed that elevated PDW, MPV, and PDW/P as well as tumor size, nuclear grade, and lymph node involvement were significantly associated with inferior DFS rates (tumor size: p&lt;0.01; nuclear grade, lymph node involvement, PDW, MPV, and PDW/P: p&lt;0.05). On multivariate analysis, a large tumor size and elevated PDW/P were significant prognostic factors for DFS, with hazard ratios of 3.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-8.47) and 2.99 (95% CI: 1.18-7.57), respectively (p&lt;0.05). Our study is the first to reveal that an elevated PDW/P significantly reduces DFS in patients with breast carcinoma. Measuring the PDW/P is simple, relatively inexpensive, and almost universally available using routine blood counts; this makes it an attractive biomarker for improved risk assessment.</AbstractText>\n"

A secondary objective was to examine reasons women report their experiences of reconstructive surgery were better or worse than expected. As part of a larger study of breast cancer survivors, participants completed self-administered questionnaires within 8 months of diagnosis and at 6, 12, and 18 months later. At the 18-month follow-up, women who had breast reconstruction were asked whether their reconstruction was better, the same, or worse than expected. The sample consisted of 130 survivors (mean age = 48.5 years) who had breast reconstruction following mastectomy and completed the 18-month follow-up, 42% of whom reported their reconstruction was worse than expected and only 25% reported it was better. Most frequently reported reasons for reconstruction being worse than expected were related to appearance of the reconstructed breast and pain. A high percentage of patients with breast cancer undergoing breast reconstruction following mastectomy reported the results as worse than expected, with the primary reasons for dissatisfaction related to the feel and appearance of the reconstructed breast. Patients with breast cancer considering breast reconstruction need better preoperative education or understanding about what to expect from reconstruction.</AbstractText>\n"

Chetomin (CHET), a fungal metabolite synthesized by Chaetomium cochliodes, has been reported as a promising anticancer and antiangiogenic agent but the complete molecular mechanism of its anticancer potential remains to be elucidated. In our study, we explored the anti-neoplastic action of CHET on TNBC cells. Cytotoxicity studies were performed in human TNBC cells viz. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by Sulforhodamine B assay. It exhibited antiproliferative response and induced apoptosis in both the cell types. Cell cycle analysis revealed that it increases the sub G0/G1 phase cell population. Modulation of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase 3/7 and a remarkable increase in the expression of cleaved PARP and increased chromatin condensation was observed after CHET treatment in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Additionally, an elevated level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> played an important role in CHET mediated cell death response. Calcium overload in mitochondria led to release of cytochrome c which in turn triggered caspase-3 mediated cell death. Inhibition of calcium signalling using BAPTA-AM reduced apoptosis confirming the involvement of calcium signalling in CHET induced cell death. Chetomin also inhibited PI3K/mTOR cell survival pathway in human TNBC cells.

Individual-level linkage of DBCG data to other population-based and medical registries in Denmark, including the Danish National Prescription Registry, has facilitated large population-based pharmacoepidemiology studies. A unique advantage of using DBCG data for such studies is the ability to investigate the association of drugs with breast cancer recurrence rather than breast cancer mortality - which may be misclassified - or all-cause mortality. Here we summarize findings from pharmacoepidemiological studies, based on DBCG data, on the association between routinely used prescription drugs and risk of breast cancer recurrence.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Our findings suggest that concurrent use of glucocorticoids, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, digoxin, and opioids has little impact on breast cancer recurrence. Similarly, patients who use SSRIs concurrently with tamoxifen treatment are not at increased risk of recurrence. In contrast, post-diagnostic use of simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, correlates with a decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence, providing a rationale for a prospective randomized clinical trial investigating simvastatin as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">As a whole, findings of pharmacoepidemiological studies based on DBCG data provide reassurance to physicians and healthcare personnel who provide supportive care during and after cancer (including prescriptions for comedications) and to breast cancer survivors for whom the risk of breast cancer recurrence is a major concern.</AbstractText>\n"

In this study, we discovered a β-phenylalanine scaffold by virtual high-throughput screening, as well as designed and synthesized 46 derivatives with assessment of inhibition activity against eEF2K and cytotoxicity. After several rounds of kinase and anti-proliferative activity screening, we discovered an eEF2K inhibitor (21l) with best eEF2K enzymatic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.5 μM) and anti-proliferative activity (MDA-MB-231 cells, IC<sub>50</sub> of 12.6 μM, MDA-MB-436 cells, IC<sub>50</sub> of 19.8 μM). Moreover, we found that 21l could induce cell death via the apoptotic pathways in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. Subsequently, we evaluated its anti-tumor activity and apoptosis-inducing mechanisms in vivo. These results suggested that 21l inhibited tumor growth by apoptosis in the xenograft mouse model of breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436). Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel small-molecule inhibitor targeting eEF2K with mechanism of apoptosis and a therapeutic potential in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Autologous fat grafting is a well-established method used in cosmetic surgery; however, fat re-absoprtion, fat necrosis, calcifications and oil-cyst formation are some usually encountered complications limiting the efficacy of this approach. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has recently been postulated as a promising method for tissue regeneration since it contains high levels of diverse human growth factors. To date, preliminary results from clinical studies regarding the combination of PRP and fat grafting in breast reconstruction have shown ambiguous results, whereas preclinical studies are more favorable. However, concerns have been raised regarding the extent of cellular promotion induced by PRP application and the corresponding potential malignant transformation. The aim of our study was to present, analyze and critically evaluate the role of PRP in breast reconstruction after breast cancer surgery in terms of efficacy and oncological safety highlighting the caution that needs to be taken in order to eliminate any chance of recurrence in patients who have theoretically undergone complete excision of the tumor burden.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The ACuNPs formation was characterized by TEM, DLS and UV-Vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The cytotoxic efficacy of the ACuNPs against human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231) and normal cells (MCF-10A) was compared using a standard MTT assay. The mechanism of cell death induced by ACuNPs was considered by inverted and fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry and gel electrophoresis. The effects of compounds on ROS generations in MDA-MB 231 cells were also studied.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">It was found that the resulted ACuNPs with a diameter of 62.7 nm and zeta potential of about -10.76 mV, are suitable for extravasation into tumor cells. In ACuNPs, the 90% of the secondary structure and almost all the tertiary structure of albumin remained intact. Comparing to CuNPs, ACuNPs could significantly suppress the viability of cancer cells while they were less toxic on normal cells. Compared with the untreated cells, the MDA-MB 231 cell line showed higher levels of ROS production after treatment with ACuNPs. The increase in ROS production after 24 hours indicated that ACuNPs induce apoptosis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The ACuNPs characteristics such as intact structure of albumin, high toxicity against cancer cells comparing to normal cells and apoptosis induction as the mechanism of cell death, revealed that this nanocomposite is a good candidate to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells.</AbstractText>\n"

FasL translocation to the membrane was achieved by culturing the cells in the presence of human interferon-γ (IFNγ). Translocation was detected by immunofluorescence. The ability of a Fas:Fc fusion protein to trigger apoptosis in these cells was investigated by cell death detection ELISA. After incubation with IFNγ for 4 h and 18 h, apoptosis was assessed in response to treatment with Fas:Fc.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Immunofluorescence revealed that the used cell lines were positive for FasL which was increased and changed to more membrane-bound FasL expression after IFNγ stimulation. After stimulation with 50 IU/ml IFNγ, Fas:Fc significantly increased MCF7 apoptosis (1.39 ± 0.06-fold, p = 0.0004) after 18 h. After stimulation with 100 IU/ml, Fas:Fc significantly increased apoptosis both after 4 h (1.49 ± 0.15-fold, p = 0.018) and 18 h (1.30 ± 0.06-fold, p = 0.013).

Recent evidence indicates that the expression of miR-181a is altered in breast tumor tissue and in the serum of patients with breast cancer. However, there are several contradicting findings that challenge the biological significance of miR-181a in tumor development and metastasis. In fact, some studies have implicated miR-181a in regulating breast cancer gene expression. Here we summarize the current literature demonstrating established links between miR-181a and human breast cancer with a focus on recently identified mechanisms of action. This review also aims to explore the potential of miR-181a as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for breast cancer and to discuss the contradicting data regarding its targeting therapeutics and the associated challenges.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Author(s).

However, with multiple assays available and numerous types of validation studies performed, the added value for daily clinical practice is still unclear. In Europe, the MammaPrint, OncotypeDX, PAM50/Prosigna and Endopredict assays are commercially available. In this systematic review, we aim to assess these assays on four important criteria: Assay development and methodology, clinical validation, clinical utility and economic value. We performed a literature search covering PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane, for studies related to one or more of the four selected assays. We identified 147 papers for inclusion in this review. MammaPrint and OncotypeDX both have evidence available, including level IA clinical trial results for both assays. Both assays provide prognostic information. Predictive value has only been shown for OncotypeDX. In the clinical utility studies, a higher reduction in chemotherapy was achieved by OncotypeDX, although the number of available studies differ considerably between tests. On average, economic evaluations estimate that genomic testing results in a moderate increase in total costs, but that these costs are acceptable in relation to the expected improved patient outcome. PAM50/prosigna and EndoPredict showed comparable prognostic capacities, but with less economical and clinical utility studies. Furthermore, for these assays no level IA trial data are available yet. In summary, all assays have shown excellent prognostic capacities. The differences in the quantity and quality of evidence are discussed. Future studies shall focus on the selection of appropriate subgroups for testing and long-term outcome of validation trials, in order to determine the place of these assays in daily clinical practice.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, the role of CXCR7 in different subtype of BCa still remains unclear. Here we note that CXCR7 expression is significantly amplified in Luminal type BCa tissues as compared with Her2 and TNBC types through data-mining in TCGA datasets, and its protein level positively correlates with ERα expression by staining of human BCa tissue. Interestingly, alteration of CXCR7 expression in Luminal type BCa cells is able to modulate the expression of ERα through ubiquitination at post-translational level. Additionally, overexpression of CXCR7 in these cells greatly induces 4-OHT insensitivity in vitro and is associated with earlier recurrence in patients with tamoxifen therapy. Notably, silencing ERα expression potentially rescues the sensitivity of the above cells to 4-OHT, suggesting that elevated level of ERα is responsible for CXCR7-induced 4-OHT insensitivity in Luminal type BCa. Finally, mechanistic analyses show that the reduced BRCA1 (ubiquitin E3 ligase) and elevated OTUB1 (deubiquitinase) expression, which are regulated by CXCR7/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, are responsible for stabilizing ERα protein. In conclusion, our results suggest that targeting CXCR7 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of BCa patients with tamoxifen therapy.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Osteoporosis is interpreted both as a direct marker of osteoblastic decline and as an indirect marker of increased bone marrow adiposity within the hematopoietic microenvironment. Patients from the &quot;Centre du Sein&quot; at CHUV (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois) undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were included in this study. Evolution of blood counts was studied in correlation with the osteoporosis status. Toxicity of chemotherapy was coded according to published probability of febrile neutropenia. One hundred forty-three women were included: mean age 52.1 ± 12.5 years, mean BMI (body mass index) 24.4 ± 4.1. BMD (bone mineral density) scored osteoporotic in 32% and osteopenic in 45%. Prior to chemotherapy, BMD was positively correlated with neutrophil (p &lt; 0.001) and thrombocyte (p = 0.01) count; TBS (trabecular bone score) was not correlated with blood count. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, an increase of one point in TBS correlated with a decrease of 57% on the time to reach leucocyte nadir (p = 0.004). There was a positive correlation between BMD and risk of infection (p &lt; 0.001). Our data demonstrates an association between osteoporosis and lower blood counts in a younger cohort than previously published, extending it for the first time to neutrophil counts in females. Our results suggest that the healthier the bone, the earlier the lowest leucocyte count value, prompting further research on this area.</AbstractText>\n"

CAVEOLIN-1 (CAV-1)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) nuclear translocation following irradiation promotes DNA repair and thus induces radiation resistance.

Nuclear accumulation of EGFR as well as DNA repair and damage at multiple time points following irradiation with or without CAV-1 siRNA pretreatment were investigated using western blotting and confocal microscopy. The radiosensitizing effect of CAV-1 siRNA was evaluated using a clonogenic assay. Flowcytometry was performed to analyse cell apoptosis and cell cycle alteration.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">We found that CAV-1 is over-expressed in basal-like TNBC cell lines and barely expressed in HER-2-positive cells; additionally, we observed that HER-2-positive cell lines are more sensitive to irradiation than basal-like TNBC cells. Our findings revealed that radiation-induced EGFR nuclear translocation was impaired by knockdown of CAV-1. In parallel, radiation-induced elevation of DNA repair proteins was also hampered by pretreatment with CAV-1 siRNA before irradiation. Silencing of CAV-1 also promoted DNA damage 24 h after irradiation. Colony formation assays verified that cells could be radiosensitized after knockdown of CAV-1. Furthermore, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis enhancement may also contribute to the radiosensitizing effect of CAV-1 siRNA.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our results support the hypothesis that CAV-1 knockdown by siRNA causes increased radiosensitivity in basal-like TNBC cells.

TNBC is a type of breast cancer that often affects younger women, and generally has a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Recently, the complex role of the immune system in cancer growth, elimination and metastasis has been the object of increased attention. There is hope that a more detailed understanding of the intricate roles of the constituents of the immune system, will hold potential both as prognostic or predictive markers of cancer progression, but also as treatment targets for a wide range of tumors, including TNBC.

Using a prognostic standard mortality rate index (PSMRi) developed by the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) 39 patients were assigned with an intermediate risk and among these 16 (41%) were furthermore diagnosed by the multi-gene signature assigned with a luminal A tumor and consequently spared adjuvant chemotherapy. There was overall agreement between mRNA derived and IHC hormone receptor status, whereas IHC Ki67 protein proliferative index proved inaccurate, compared to the mRNA derived index. Forty-one patients with basal-like (basL) subtypes were screened for predisposing mutations regardless of clinical predisposition.

MR images of 100 patients with BM from primary breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided according to the biological subtype of the primary tumor, (triple-negative: 24, HER2 positive: 48, luminal: 28). All images marked with BMs were standardized to the human brain MRI atlas provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 database. Distribution pattern of BM was evaluated with intra-group and intergroup analysis. In intra-group analysis, hot spots of metastases from triple-negative are evenly distributed in the brain, meanwhile BMs from HER2 positive and luminal type occur dominantly in occipital lobe and cerebellum. In intergroup analysis, BMs from triple-negative type occurred more often in frontal lobe, limbic region, and parietal lobe, compared with other types (P &lt; .05). Breast cancer subtypes tend to demonstrate different spatial distributions of their BMs. These findings may have direct implications for dose modulation in prophylactic irradiation as well as for differential diagnoses. Thus, this result should be validated in future study with a larger population.</AbstractText>\n"

Of them, 588 patients (24.4%) received postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT), while 1 825 (75.6%) patients did not. A comprehensive comparative study was performed by using multivariable and propensity score-matched (PSM) analyses. <b>Results:</b> The median follow-up time was 67.0 months, the 5-year local region recurrence free-survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 93.8%, 85.7% and 93.3%, respectively. The 5-year local region recurrence (LRR) was 6.1%. For patients without PMRT, multivariable analysis indicated that age, tumor localization, molecular subtype, pathologic T stage and number of positive lymph node were independent factors for LRRFS (all of <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer were classified into low-risk group (0-1 risk factor, 768 patients), intermediate-risk group (2 risk factors, 690 patients) and high-risk groups (≥3 risk factors, 544 patients) based on the five independent factors mentioned above. The 5-year LRRFS, DFS and OS were significantly different among the three groups (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).

In this study, we demonstrated that a non-cytotoxic concentration of DRβ-H markedly suppressed wound healing migration, migration through the chamber and invasion through the matrigel. In addition, DRβ-H regulated expression of RNPC1, E-cadherin proteins of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, RNPC1 knockdown decreased the DRβ-H-induced up-regulation of RNPC1 and E-Cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells. RNPC1 knockdown reduced the anti-metastasis activities of DRβ-H, meaning that the up-rugulation of RNPC1 by DRβ-H is essential for its anti-metastatis activities.

Little is known about associations by breast cancer subtype or among African American (AA) women, who are disproportionately affected by T2D and estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer. We assessed the relation of T2D to incidence of ER- and ER+ breast cancer in data from the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort of AA women enrolled in 1995 and followed biennially. During 847,934 person-years of follow-up, there were 1,851 incident invasive breast cancers, including 914 ER+ and 468 ER- cases. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute HRs for breast cancer incidence associated with T2D relative to no T2D, controlling for body mass index (BMI) and other potential confounders. The HR for T2D relative to no T2D was 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.40] for overall breast cancer incidence, with the increase accounted for by ER- cancer: HRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.80-1.31) for ER+ and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.03-2.00) for ER- cancer. The HR for T2D and ER- breast cancer was highest among nonobese women (1.92; 95% CI, 1.22-3.04). The findings suggest that AA women with T2D are at increased risk of developing ER- breast cancer and that poor metabolic health may be more important than obesity for this subtype.

Obesity has been identified as one of the major risk factors for breast cancer progression. The mechanisms by which obesity contributes to breast cancer development is not yet understood; however, there are a few mechanisms counted as potential producers of breast cancer in obesity, including insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and sex hormones. Recent emerging evidence suggests that alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expressions are found in several diseases, including breast cancer and obesity; however, miRNA roles in obesity-linked breast cancer are beginning to unravel. miRNAs are thought to be potential noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients with comorbid conditions of obesity as well as therapeutic targets. Recent studies have evidenced that nutrients and other dietary factors protect against cancer and obesity through modulation of miRNA expressions. Herein, we summarize a comprehensive overview of up-to-date information related to miRNAs and their molecular targets involved in obesity-associated breast cancer.

Cancer screening could save lives in some cases, however, in other cases, it might also turn people into overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is the diagnosis of cancer that will never cause symptoms or death during a patient's lifetime. Therefore, overdiagnosis might lead to unnecessary treatments and lifetime surveillance, and then increase economic burden and psychological burden. In this review, we focus on how to correctly evaluate the overdiagnosis rate, and how to avoid or reduce the harms caused by overdiagnosis in the future according to the reasons associated with overdiagnosis. After systematically reviewing the previous studies, we will try to identify the potential reasons associated with overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening with mammography, address how to correctly evaluate the overdiagnosis rate, and finally provide some suggestions to reduce the overdiagnosis.</AbstractText>\n"

To optimize the strategy for treatment, particularly in young women, prognostic biomarkers are urgently required. The objective of this study was to identify a tissue microRNA (miRNA) signature that predicts prognosis in young breast cancer patients. Total RNA from 45 breast cancer patients aged &lt;35 years was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and analyzed using miRNA microarrays. Patients were categorized into two groups according to recurrence status within the 5 year period after surgery: recurrence (n = 11) and non-recurrent (n = 34). Histological parameters of hormone receptors and Ki-67 were statistically compared between the two groups. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and their associations with overall survival (OS) were evaluated by log-rank test. The median observation period was 5.8 years for the recurrent group, and 9.1 years for the non-recurrent group. Nine miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the identified miRNAs, and the resultant area under the curve was &gt;0.7. Five of the miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the expression levels of three of those five (miR-183-5p, miR-194-5p, and miR-1285-5p), both alone and in combination, were associated with OS. In conclusion, we identified three candidate miRNAs that could be used separately or in combination as prognostic biomarkers in young breast cancer patients. This miRNA signature may enable selection of better treatment choices for young women with this disease.</AbstractText>\n"

All metabolic parameters were measured from the tumor volume segmented by a gradient-based method. Once the primary target lesion was segmented, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated automatically by the MIMvista software.Mean age of 173 patients was 49 years. Of 173 patients, 45 (26%) showed ALNM. On univariate analysis, larger tumor size (&gt;2.2 cm; P = .002), presence of lymphovascular invasion (P &lt; .001), higher SUVmax (&gt;2.82; P = .038), higher SUVmean (&gt;1.2; P = .027), higher MTV (&gt;2.38; P &lt; .001), and higher TLG (&gt;3.98; P = .007) were associated with a higher probability of ALNM.

Such simplified conditions lead to phenotypical cell changes and altered cell behaviors. Hence, much research has been focused on developing novel biomaterials and culture conditions that more closely emulate in vivo cell microenvironments. In particular, biomaterial stiffness has emerged as a key property that greatly affects cell behaviors such as adhesion, morphology, proliferation and motility among others. Here we ask whether cells that have been conditioned to TCP, would still show significant dependence on substrate stiffness if they are first pre-adapted to a more physiologically relevant environment. We used two commonly utilized breast cancer cell lines, namely MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and examined the effect of prolonged cell culturing on polyacrylamide substrates of varying compliance. We followed changes in cell adhesion, proliferation, shape factor, spreading area and spreading rate. After pre-adaptation, we noted diminished differences in cell behaviors when comparing between soft (1 kPa) and stiff (103 kPa) gels as well as rigid TCP control. Prolonged culturing of cells on complaint substrates further influenced responses of pre-adapted cells when transferred back to TCP. Our results have implications for the study of stiffness-dependent cell behaviors and indicate that cell pre-adaptation to the substrate needs consideration.</AbstractText>\n"

They were evaluated for their anticancer activity against MCF-7 cell line. Three compounds 9c, 9d and 11b showed 1.5-1.03 folds more potent anticancer activity than doxorubicin. In this study, a promising multi-sited enzyme small molecule inhibitor 9c, which showed the most potent anti-proliferative activity, was identified. The anti-proliferative activity of this compound appears to correlate well with its ability to inhibit topoisomerase II (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.29 μM). Moreover, compound 9c showed excellent VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity, at the sub-micromolar level with IC<sub>50</sub> value 0.2 μM, which is 2.1 folds more potent than sorafenib. Moreover, activation of damage response pathway of the DNA leads to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, accumulation of cells in pre-G1 phase and annexin-V and propidium iodide staining, indicating that cell death proceeds through an apoptotic mechanism. Compound 9c showed potent pro-apoptotic effect through induction of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This mechanistic pathway was confirmed by a significant increase in the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53, elevation in Bax/BCL-2 ratio and a significant increase in the level of active caspase-3. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies delivered equations of five 3D descriptors with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.814. This QSAR model provides an effective technique for understanding the observed antitumor properties and thus could be adopted for developing effective lead structures.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The in vitro cytotoxic activity of 1-5 against human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells: MCF-7 (positive to estrogen receptors (ERs)) and MDA-MB-231 (negative to estrogen receptors (ERs)) was evaluated. Compound 4 exhibits the stronger activity against MCF-7 (2.5 ± 0.1 μΜ), while 1 the strongest one against MDA-MB-231 (3.2 ± 0.3 μΜ). The IC<sub>50</sub> values against normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells lie between 3.0 and 3.7 μΜ.

Endocrine therapy is a major treatment option for all disease stages of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and improves overall survival. However, endocrine therapy is limited by de novo and acquired resistance. Several factors have been proposed for endocrine therapy failures, which include molecular alterations in the estrogen receptor pathway, altered expression of cell-cycle regulators, autophagy, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as a consequence of tumor progression and selection pressure. It is essential to reveal and monitor intra- and intertumoral alterations in breast cancer to allow optimal therapy outcome. Endocrine therapy navigation by molecular profiling of tissue biopsies is the current gold standard but limited in many reasons. &quot;Liquid biopsies&quot; such as circulating-tumor cells and circulating-tumor DNA offer hope to fill that gap in allowing non-invasive serial assessment of biomarkers predicting success of endocrine therapy regimen. In this context, this review will provide an overview on inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of endocrine resistance mechanisms and discuss the potential role of &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; as navigators to personalize treatment methods and prevent endocrine treatment resistance in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

JAHA's cytotoxic activity on MDA-MB231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells at 72 h has been previously demonstrated with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.45 μM. JAHA's lethal effect was found linked to perturbations of cell cycle, mitochondrial activity, signal transduction, and autophagy mechanisms. To glean novel insights on how MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells respond to the cytotoxic effect induced by JAHA, and to compare the biological effect with the related compound SAHA, we have employed a combination of differential display-PCR, proteome analysis, and COMET assay techniques and shown some differences in the molecular signature profiles induced by exposure to either HDACis. In particular, in contrast to the more numerous and diversified changes induced by SAHA, JAHA has shown a more selective impact on expression of molecular signatures involved in antioxidant activity and DNA repair. Besides expanding the biological knowledge of the effect exerted by the modifications in compound structures on cell phenotype, the molecular elements put in evidence in our study may provide promising targets for therapeutic interventions on TNBCs.</AbstractText>\n"

The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status. Among the patients with stage T1 disease, the risk of distant recurrence was 13% with no nodal involvement (T1N0), 20% with one to three nodes involved (T1N1-3), and 34% with four to nine nodes involved (T1N4-9); among those with stage T2 disease, the risks were 19% with T2N0, 26% with T2N1-3, and 41% with T2N4-9. The risk of death from breast cancer was similarly dependent on TN status, but the risk of contralateral breast cancer was not. Given the TN status, the factors of tumor grade (available in 43,590 patients) and Ki-67 status (available in 7692 patients), which are strongly correlated with each other, were of only moderate independent predictive value for distant recurrence, but the status regarding the progesterone receptor (in 54,115 patients) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) (in 15,418 patients in trials with no use of trastuzumab) was not predictive. During the study period from 5 to 20 years, the absolute risk of distant recurrence among patients with T1N0 breast cancer was 10% for low-grade disease, 13% for moderate-grade disease, and 17% for high-grade disease; the corresponding risks of any recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer were 17%, 22%, and 26%, respectively.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">After 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, breast-cancer recurrences continued to occur steadily throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years.

This problem can be overcome by computing drug sensitivity on a per-division basis. The normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) approach yields per-division metrics for drug potency (GR<sub>50</sub>) and efficacy (GR<sub>max</sub>) that are analogous to the more familiar IC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> values. In this work, we report GR-based, proliferation-corrected, drug sensitivity metrics for ~4,700 pairs of breast cancer cell lines and perturbagens. Such data are broadly useful in understanding the molecular basis of therapeutic response and resistance. Here, we use them to investigate the relationship between different measures of drug sensitivity and conclude that drug potency and efficacy exhibit high variation that is only weakly correlated.

Many studies indicated that PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors and Hh inhibitors displayed synergistic effects, and the combination of the two signaling drugs could delay drug resistance and inhibit cancer migration in breast cancer. Therefore, the development of molecules simultaneously inhibiting these two pathways is urgent needed. Based on the structures of PI3K inhibitor buparlisib and Hh inhibitor vismodegib, a series of hybrid structures were designed and synthesized utilizing rational drug design and computer-based drug design. Several compounds displayed excellent antiproliferative activities against several breast cancer cell lines, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cell. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that the representative compound 9i could inhibit both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and hedgehog (Hh) signalings by inhibiting the phosphorylation of S6K and Akt as well as decreasing the SAG elevated expression of Gli1. Compound 9i could also induce apoptosis remarkably in T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells.

The primary aims of this approach are to: 1) reduce tumor burden thereby permitting breast conservation rather than mastectomy; 2) promptly treat possible metastatic disease, whether or not it is detectable on preoperative staging; and 3) potentially tailor future chemotherapeutic decisions by monitoring in-vivo tumor response. Accurate radiological assessment permits optimal management and planning in this population. However, assessment of tumor size and response to treatment can vary depending on the modality used, the measurement technique (such as single longest diameter, 3-D measurements, or calculated tumor volume), and varied response of different tumor subtypes to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (such as concentric shrinkage or tumor fragmentation).

Although the time-dependent effect of the oestrogen receptor (ER) status of the tumour has already been described, so far no factor has proven to disentangle the multi-peak behaviour observed for breast cancer recurrences. Here, we aimed at investigating whether adiposity at diagnosis, reflected by increased patient's body mass index (BMI), could be associated with breast cancer recurrence patterns over time after primary cancer therapy.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">We retrieved BMI from 734 of 777 patients with node-positive breast cancer from a phase III randomised clinical trial, which compared different chemotherapy regimens and had a median follow-up of 15.4 years. Cumulative incidence estimation as well as piecewise exponential models were carried out to estimate the distant recurrence dynamics, in all patients, as well as in subgroups based on the ER status, with the ER-positive group being further split according to the menopausal status.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">In patients with ER-negative breast cancer, time-dependent analyses revealed that the hazard of late relapses could mainly be attributed to the overweight and obese patients. Within the subgroup of premenopausal patients with ER-positive tumours, obesity was associated with an early high narrow peak of distant recurrences followed by another main peak after 5 years of follow-up. The risk for overweight patients was intermediate between obese and normal-weight patients. In the postmenopausal subgroup of patients with ER-positive tumours, the distant recurrence rate was significantly more elevated in the overweight patients compared to the other BMI categories, and a second late peak of recurrences was also observed for the obese patients.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\">These results demonstrate that the patient's BMI at diagnosis is associated with cancer recurrence dynamics.

Major progress has been made in identifying the drivers malignant growth in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and the mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. This progress has translated into several targeted therapies that enhance the efficacy of endocrine therapy; inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 like palbociclib and inhibitors of mTOR substantially improve progression-free survival. For patients with HER2-positive disease the addition of Pertuzumab to Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been a significant improvement in anti-HER2 therapy in early as well as metastatic breast cancer.

For triple negative disease the angiogenesis inhibitor Bevacizumab is approved, which increases progression free survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP-inhibitors or anti-androgens represent promising strategies, all of which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The development of predictive biomarkers to guide targeted therapies is still the subject of research.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</CopyrightInformation>\n"
"29073169","2017/10/27 06:00","Expression and function of the miR-143/145 cluster in vitro and in vivo in human breast cancer.","<AbstractText>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are dysregulated in cancer. Studies of miRNAs to explore their potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers are of great scientific interest. Here, we investigate the functional properties and expression of the miR-143/145 cluster in breast cancer (BC) in vitro and in vivo. The ER positive MCF7, the HER2 positive SK-BR-3, and the triple negative cell line MDA-MB-231 were used to assess cell proliferation and cell invasion. Expression of miRNA in 108 breast cancers in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study and 44 benign tissue controls were analyzed by microarray and validated by RT-PCR. Further, in situ hybridization (ISH) was used to study the cellular and subcellular distribution of the miRNAs. In vitro, miR-143 promoted proliferation of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas miR-145 and the cotransfection of both miRNAs inhibited proliferation in all three cell lines. The cells' invasive capacity was reduced after transfection and cotransfection of the miRNAs. In line with the tumor suppressive functions in vitro, the expression of miR-143 and miR-145 was lower in malignant compared to benign breast tissue, and lower in the more aggressive tumors with higher tumor grade, loss of ER and the basal-like phenotype. ISH revealed miR-143 to be cytoplasmatic and predominantly expressed in luminal cells in benign tissue, whilst miR-145 was nuclear and with strong staining in myoepithelial cells. Both miRNAs were present in malignant epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts in BC. This study demonstrates that miR-143 and -145 have functional properties and expression patterns typical for tumor suppressors, but the function is influenced by cellular factors such as cell type and miRNA cotransfection. Further, the nuclear functions of miR-145 should be explored for a more complete understanding of the complexity of miRNA regulation and function in BC.</AbstractText>\n"

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes, and then HER2 exon 27 mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves and the differences between the curves were compared by log-rank tests. A total cohort of 892 female patients with operable primary breast cancer was included in this study. The median follow-up was 47 months. Of these 892 patients, 3.7% (33/892) had HER2 exon 27 mutations. Patients with the HER2 exon 27 mutations had a significant worse recurrence-free survival (RFS, unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.42; 95% CI: 1.05-5.58; P = 0.032) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS, unadjusted HR 2.81; 95% CI: 1.21-6.50; P = 0.012) than the patients with the wild-type exon 27. Among the 673 patients with negative HER2 expression, 24 mutants were found. Patients with the HER2 mutations showed a worse RFS (unadjusted HR 5.08; 95% CI: 2.14-12.02; P &lt; 0.001) and DRFS (unadjusted HR 5.62; 95% CI: 2.36-13.40; P &lt; 0.001) than those patients with the wild-type exon 27. Furthermore, the mutations remained as unfavorable independent predictors for RFS and DRFS. Breast cancer patients with HER2 exon 27 mutations have a worse survival, especially in HER2-negative patients. HER2-negative patients with HER2 exon 27 mutations are potential subgroup of breast cancer patients benefiting from HER2-targeted therapy in future.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors.

A biochemical approach that is not affected by density would provide an important tool to healthcare professionals who are managing women with dense breasts and suspicious imaging findings. Videssa® Breast is a combinatorial proteomic biomarker assay (CPBA), comprised of Serum Protein Biomarkers (SPB) and Tumor Associated Autoantibodies (TAAb) integrated with patient-specific clinical data to produce a diagnostic score that reliably detects breast cancer (BC) as an adjunctive tool to imaging. The performance of Videssa® Breast was evaluated in the dense (a and b) and non-dense (c and d) groups in a population of n = 545 women under age 50. The sensitivity and specificity in the dense breast group were calculated to be 88.9% and 81.2%, respectively, and 92.3% and 86.6%, respectively, for the non-dense group. No significant differences were observed in the sensitivity (p = 1.0) or specificity (p = 0.18) between these groups. The NPV was 99.3% and 99.1% in non-dense and dense groups, respectively. Unlike imaging, Videssa® Breast does not appear to be impacted by breast density; it can effectively detect breast cancer in women with dense and non-dense breasts alike. Thus, Videssa® Breast provides a powerful tool for healthcare providers when women with dense breasts present with challenging imaging findings. In addition, Videssa® Breast provides assurance to women with dense breasts that they do not have breast cancer, reducing further anxiety in this higher risk patient population.</AbstractText>\n"

Mohs paste is a histopathological fixative with zinc chloride as the main ingredient. It is applied when performing chemosurgery for skin tumors. In recent years, this paste has reportedly been very effective for the control of various symptoms of skin metastases in inoperable advanced cancers, such as pungent odor and hemorrhage, in the field of palliative care. We evaluated the clinical significance of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase(IDO)in the serum of patients with locally advanced breast cancer during Mohs paste treatment. IDO activity was measured by the tryptophan(Trp)/kynurenine(Kyn)ratio. Trp and Kyn levels were measured using high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC). We collected serum samples from 3 locally advanced breast cancer cases: once in the pre-treatment phase, 2 times in the post-treatment phase, and 5 times in the post-treatment phase. Then, we measured the Trp/Kyn ratio and CRP in these samples during Mohs paste treatment. There were no significant differences in serum Trp/ Kyn ratios between the phases, but serum CRP values decreased after Mohs paste treatment. These results suggest that Mohs paste treatment for locally advanced breast cancer lesions may be useful in enhancing patients' QOL without immunosuppression.</AbstractText>\n"

In patients with oligometastatic breast cancer their prognosis may be good, although the impact of local therapy has not been evaluated prospectively. The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques and highly conformal ablative radiotherapy allow for safe and effective ablation of metastatic lesions in most locations. A biopsy(preferably providing histology)of a metastatic lesion has been recommended to confirm diagnosis particularly when metastasis is diagnosed for the first time. Biology markers(especially HER2 and hormone receptor)should be reassessed because it may differ from the primary tumor. Although some retrospective studies have suggested that achieving a sustained complete remission seems to be associated with a longer survival, the true impact of these local-regional therapies on long-term outcome remains unknown, and if possible, randomized trials are needed.</AbstractText>\n"

We investigate the effect of human APE1 (apurinic/apyrimidyl endonuclease 1), a rate-limiting enzyme of base excision repair, on the prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer and drug sensitivity of olaparib. The expression of APE1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in the triple-negative breast cancer tissues and its effect on survival of triple-negative breast cancer patients was followed. To find whether APE1 effect the drug sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer cells, the APE1-knockout HCC1937 cell line (triple-negative breast cancer cell line) was established by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Then, we use the wild-type and knockout one to test the drug sensitivity of olaparib. The expression of APE1 in triple-negative breast cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in the adjacent tissues (85.6% vs 14.4%) and its expression was related to tumor size (p &lt; 0.05). We also found that it is an independent prognostic factor in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (overall survival, p = 0.01). In vitro assay, the half maximal inhibitory concentration of olaparib in HCC1937-APE1-KO was significantly increased (17.22 vs 91.85 μM) compared to the wild type. The growth curve showed that olaparib had a stronger lethality on HCC1937 compared to HCC1937- APE1-KO (p &lt; 0.05 on day 3). HCC1937 resulted in more mitotic G2/M arrest and increased apoptosis rate after treatment with 40 μM of olaparib, while HCC1937-APE1-KO did not change significantly. When HCC1937 was treated with different concentrations of olaparib, it was found that APE1 expression decreased more significantly at 15 μM of olaparib was. In HCC1937-APE1-KO, the expression of endogenous poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 was also less than that of HCC1937. These results suggested that the expression of APE1 was an important basis for the maintenance of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, and the deletion of APE1 may be related to the resistance of olaparib.</AbstractText>\n"

Immune cells could drive important clinical characteristics that affect BC outcomes. Subgroups of patients who have tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the stroma may have better response to chemotherapy and favorable long-term prognosis. Accumulating evidence shows that the immune system plays a crucial role in the outcomes of some BC subgroups, especially more aggressive, proliferative ones such as triple-negative and HER2-positive BC.

Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy represents a substantial portion of breast cancer expenditures. The relative value of novel radiotherapeutic approaches such as intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) compared with conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) is unknown. Therefore, we used prospectively collected outcomes from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to compare the cost-effectiveness of these approaches.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"Methods\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">We constructed a decision-analytic model that followed women who were treated with lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. Recurrence, mortality, complication rates, and utilities (five-year radiation-associated quality of life scores), were extracted from RCTs. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost-effectiveness from societal and health care sector perspectives was estimated considering two scenarios-the first assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists five years after treatment, and the second assumes that disutility discontinues. Lifetime outcomes were summarized using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the results.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"Results\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">HF-WBI dominated CF-WBI (ie, resulted in higher quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and lower cost) in all scenarios. HF-WBI also had a greater likelihood of cost-effectiveness compared with IORT; under a societal perspective that assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists, HF-WBI results in an ICER of $17 024 per QALY compared with IORT with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 80% at the $100 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. If radiation-associated disutility is assumed to discontinue, the ICER is lower ($11 461/QALY), resulting in an even higher (83%) probability of relative cost-effectiveness. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of metastasis and treatment cost.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"Conclusions\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">For women with early-stage breast cancer requiring adjuvant radiotherapy, HF-WBI is cost-effective compared with CF-WBI and IORT.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

The immunomodulatory role of B cells is being increasingly recognized in autoimmune diseases and cancers. In recent years, immunotherapeutic strategies that upregulate the patient's own antitumor T cell responses have shown promise in treating solid tumors and are being developed for breast cancer. In this study, we discovered that the B cells in breast cancer patients were enriched with interferon (IFN)-γ-expressing cells and presented high potency for IFN-γ production. These IFN-γ-expressing B cells were enriched in, but did not completely overlap with, the CD21<sup>lo/med</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup>IgA<sup>-</sup> B cell subset, which was consistent with IgG-expressing memory B cells. Compared to CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>-</sup> B cells, the CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells expressed significantly higher IFN-γ expression. Given that B cells demonstrate important antigen-presenting function to T cells, we incubated CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>-</sup> B cells and CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells with autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Compared to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were incubated with CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>-</sup> B cells, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were incubated with CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells presented significantly higher TBX21 and lower FOXP3 expression, suggesting that the CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells, but not the CD27<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>-</sup> B cells, promoted Th1 and suppressed regulatory T cell responses.

Gene expression profiling of TNBC has identified molecular subtypes and representative cell lines. An extract of the Texas native plant Amyris texana was found to have selective activity against MDA-MB-453 cells, a model of the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype of TNBC. Bioassay-guided fractionation identified two oxazole natural products with selective activity against this cell line. Conducted analog synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies provided analogs with more potent and selective activity against two LAR subtype cell line models, culminating in the discovery of compound 30 (CIDD-0067106). Lead compounds discovered have potent and selective antiproliferative activities, and mechanisms of action studies show they inhibit the activity of the mTORC1 pathway.</AbstractText>\n"

A number of these cells have been generated from biopsies of breast cancer patients, including ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinomas. The characterization of their genomic signatures is essential to determine their ability to reflect the natural biology of their tumors of origin. In this study, we performed the genomic characterization of six newly established invasive breast cancer CRC cultures in comparison to the original patients' primary breast tumors (PBT) from which they derived. The CRCs and corresponding PBTs were simultaneously profiled by genome-wide array-CGH, targeted next generation sequencing and global miRNA expression to determine their molecular similarities in the patterns of copy number alterations (CNAs), gene mutations and miRNA expression levels, respectively. The CRCs' epithelial cells content and ploidy levels were also evaluated by flow cytometry. A similar level of CNAs was observed in the pairs of CRCs/PBTs analyzed by array-CGH, with &gt;95% of overlap for the most frequently affected cytobands. Consistently, targeted next generation sequencing analysis showed the retention of specific somatic variants in the CRCs as present in their original PBTs. Global miRNA profiling closely clustered the CRCs with their PBTs (Pearson Correlation, ANOVA paired test, P&lt;0.05), indicating also similarity at the miRNA expression level; the retention of tumor-specific alterations in a subset of miRNAs in the CRCs was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. These data demonstrated that the human breast cancer CRCs of this study maintained at early passages the overall copy number, gene mutations and miRNA expression patterns of their original tumors. The further characterization of these cells by other molecular and cellular phenotypes at late cell passages, are required to further expand their use as a unique and representative ex-vivo tumor model for basic science and translational breast cancer studies.</AbstractText>\n"

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Disease-specific survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier curve and validated by log rank test. The discriminations of independent risk factors and staging systems were compared by the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and validated by Harrell concordance index (bootstrapping algorithm). Akaike information criterion (AIC) was applied to compare the difference of model.One thousand three hundred fifty NMBC patients who had received PRT followed by MAST from 1988 to 2013 were included in the study. We found the metastatic lymph node ratio (mLNR) staging was a superior indicator than pN staging. Thus, we proposed a T-lymph node ratio (T-NR) staging system with simplified-T categories (T0-3 and T4) and the mLNR staging. The novel T-NR staging system provided larger AUC (P = .024, .008, respectively) and the smaller AIC (P &lt; .001) value than American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.The novel T-NR staging system performed more accurate survival prediction and better model fitness for NMBC patients who receive PRT followed by MAST, it may provide a wide applicability in clinical decision-making.</AbstractText>\n"

The expressions of E-cad and VEGF were detected with immunohistochemistry. The correlation of E-cad and VEGF expression with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and histological grade were analyzed. The 5-year disease-free survival rate of the 2 groups was also evaluated.There was no significant difference in the 5-year disease-free survival rate (P &gt; .05) and the expression of E-cad between the 2 groups. The positive rate of VEGF in Han was significantly lower than that in Uygur (P &lt; .05). The expression of E-cad was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and histological grade (-1≤r &lt; 1, P &lt; .05).

In this study, we developed a vaccine and therapeutic delivery system to increase cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against a breast cancer model overexpressing HER2/neu. Gp2, a HER2/neu-derived peptide, was conjugated to Maleimide-mPEG2000-DSPE micelles and post inserted into liposomes composed of DMPC, DMPG phospholipids, and fusogenic lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) containing monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvant (DMPC-DMPG-DOPE-MPL-Gp2). BALB/c mice were immunized with different formulations and the immune response was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. ELISpot and intracellular cytokine analysis by flow cytometry showed that the mice vaccinated with Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 incited the highest number of IFN-γ+ in CD8+ cells and CTL response. The immunization led to lower tumor sizes and longer survival time compared to the other groups of mice immunized and treated with the Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 formulation in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments. These results showed that co-formulation of DOPE and MPL conjugated with GP2 peptide not only induces high antitumor immunity but also enhances therapeutic efficacy in TUBO mice model. Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 formulation could be a promising vaccine and a therapeutic delivery system against HER2 positive cancers and merits further investigation.</AbstractText>\n"

CIP2A drives an oncogenic potential through inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A, stabilizing MYC, and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, although further biological mechanisms for CIP2A are yet to be defined. CIP2A protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in oestrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancers (n = 250) obtained from the Leeds Tissue Bank. In total, 51 cases presented with a relapse or metastasis during adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen and were regarded as tamoxifen resistant. CIP2A expression was scored separately for cytoplasmic, nuclear, or membranous staining, and scores were tested for statistically significant relationships with clinicopathological features. Membranous CIP2A was preferentially expressed in cases who experienced a recurrence during tamoxifen treatment thus predicting a worse overall survival (log rank = 8.357, p = 0.004) and disease-free survival (log rank = 21.766, p &lt; 0.001). Cox multivariate analysis indicates that it is an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival (hazard ratio = 4.310, p = 0.013) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 5.449, p = 0.002).

Women with recent diagnosis of breast cancer, in amenorrhea &gt;12months and age ≥45 years, without medication use or clinical conditions that interfere with VD values were included. Clinical and anthropometric data were collected. Serum level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured in all patients until 20days after breast cancer diagnosis, and was classified as normal (≥30ng/mL), insufficiency (20-29ng/mL) and deficiency (&lt;20ng/mL). Data on breast cancer (histopathological type, grade, tumor stage, lymph node status), hormone status (estrogen receptor, ER, progesterone receptor, PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) and epithelial proliferative activity (Ki-67) were collected. For statistical analysis, the t-student test, the Gamma Distribution (asymmetric variables), the chi-square test and the logistic regression (OR-odds ratio) were used. The median 25(OH)D level was 25.8ng/mL (range 12.0-59.2ng/mL). Sufficient vitamin D levels were detected in 65 patients (33.9%), whereas insufficient levels in 92 patients (47.9%), and deficient levels in 35 patients (18.2%). Participants with insufficient and deficient 25(OH)D levels had a higher proportion of tumors with a high grade and locally advanced and metastatic disease, more positive lymph node, a lower proportion of ER, PR positives tumors and higher Ki-67(p&lt;0.05). Patients with normal vitamin D had a higher frequency of luminal A (47.7%) and luminal B (32.2%) tumors when compared to patients with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Furthermore, all cases of triple negative were detected in women with low VD levels. Multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, time since menopause and BMI, showed that insufficient and deficient level of vitamin D were significantly associated with negative estrogen receptor (OR 3.77 CI 95% 1.76-8.09 and OR 3.99 CI 95% 1.83-8.68), high Ki-67 (OR 2.50, CI 95% 1.35-4.63, and OR 2.62, CI 95% 1.40-4.98), and positive axillary lymph node status (OR 1.59, CI 95% 1.03-2.33, and OR 1.58, CI 95% 1.02-2.92) respectively.

Furthermore, RBP2 expression was elevated in patients with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer (P = .04, chi-square test). Knockdown of RBP2 conferred tamoxifen sensitivity, whereas overexpression of RBP2 induced tamoxifen resistance invitro and invivo (MCF7 xenograft: tamoxifen-treated control, mean [SD] tumor volume = 70.8 [27.9] mm3, vs tamoxifen-treated RBP2, mean [SD] tumor volume = 387.9 [85.1] mm3, P &lt; .001). Mechanistically, RBP2 cooperated with ER co-activators and corepressors and regulated several tamoxifen resistance-associated genes, including NRIP1, CCND1, and IGFBP4 and IGFBP5. Furthermore, epigenetic silencing of IGFBP4/5 by RBP2-ER-NRIP1-HDAC1 complex led to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) activation.

The clinical development of non-selective CDK inhibitors failed due to combined lack of efficacy and excessive toxicity reported by clinical trials across different cancer types. The clinical development of second generation, CDK4/6-selective inhibitors, namely palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib, led to practice-changing results in the setting of breast cancer. Areas covered: This review illustrates how CDK4/6-selective inhibitors got approval for the treatment of patients with either newly diagnosed or pretreated advanced hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Furthermore, data about potential predictive biomarkers, as well as preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence for potential antitumor activity of CDK4/6 inhibition in other breast cancer subtypes is provided. Expert opinion: Future clinical development of CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer will focus on the following aspects: i) optimization of treatment sequencing for patients with advanced disease, ii) early-stage disease, iii) other subtypes of breast cancer in rationally chosen therapeutic combinations and iv) the identification of predictive biomarkers.</AbstractText>\n"

This review summarizes the evidence about the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in breast cancer staging and the therapeutic and prognostic impact accumulated in the last decade. Other related aspects, such as the association of metabolic information with biology and prognosis are considered and evidence-based recommendations for the use of 18F-FDG PET/CT in breast cancer staging are offered. We systematically searched MEDLINE for articles reporting studies with at least 30 patients related to clinical questions following the Problem/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome framework. We critically reviewed the selected articles and elaborated evidence tables structuring the summarized information into methodology, results, and limitations. The level of evidence and the grades of recommendation for the use of 18F-FDG PET/CT in different contexts are summarized. Level III evidence supports the use of 18F-FDG PET/CT for initial staging in patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer; the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of the 18F-FDG PET/CT findings is sufficient for a weak recommendation in this population. In patients with locally advanced breast cancer, level II evidence supports the use of 18F-FDG PET/CT for initial staging; the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of the 18F-FDG PET/CT findings is sufficient for a strong recommendation in this population. In patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer, the metabolic information from baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT is associated with tumor biology and has prognostic implications, supported by level II evidence. In conclusion, 18F-FDG PET/CT is not recommended for staging all patients with early breast cancer, although evidence of improved regional and systemic staging supports its use in locally advanced breast cancer. Baseline tumor glycolytic activity is associated with tumor biology and prognosis.</AbstractText>\n"

Women tend to gain weight after breast cancer diagnosis and during chemotherapy for early-stage disease, which may in turn increase risk for worse outcomes. We examined if weight gained during adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with worse survival outcomes. We queried our database for data on patients who received adjuvant third-generation chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses by Cox regression were performed for survival outcomes across three categories according to BMI variation from start to end of chemotherapy: &gt;0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> loss or gain and stable BMI (±0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). We included 1998 patients in this study. Women over 50 years old and postmenopausal were more likely to lose weight during adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas women under 30 years old gained more weight (P &lt; 0.001). At 1 year postchemotherapy, patients tended to return to their original weight (ρ = -0.3, P &lt; 0.001). On multivariate analysis, BMI increase of &gt;0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared to maintaining BMI was marginally associated with increased locoregional recurrence risk (HR: 2.53; 95% CI, 1.18-5.45; P = 0.017), adjusting for grade, stage, and radiation delivery. Weight variation during adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer may occur as both weight gain and weight loss in a balanced manner. Furthermore, this variation seems to be transient in nature and does not appear to significantly influence recurrence rates and overall survival.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors.

RNA editing by ADAR1 is a source of changes in epitope. However, ADAR1 expression in cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte levels in triple-negative breast cancer have not been well evaluated. We immunohistochemically examined ADAR1 expression in 681 triple-negative breast cancer patients and analysed their clinicopathological characteristics. We also analysed basal-like tumours using The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Among the 681 triple-negative breast cancer patients, 45.8% demonstrated high ADAR1 expression. Tumours with high ADAR1 expression exhibited high tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte levels, considerable CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration, high histological grade and high expression of interferon-related proteins, including HLA-ABC, MxA and PKR. Among patients with lymph node metastasis, those with high tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte levels and low ADAR1 expression demonstrated the best disease-free survival. The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis of basal-like tumours revealed significant positive correlation between ADAR1 and CD8B expression and positive association of high ADAR1 expression with immune responses and apoptosis pathways. We detected high ADAR1 expression in half of the triple-negative breast cancer patients. In addition to DNA mutations, RNA editing can be related to neoantigens; hence, we need to explore non-synonymous mutations exclusively found using RNA sequencing data to identify clinically relevant neoantigens.</AbstractText>\n"

Here, we show that cholesterol mediates the metastatic effects of a high-fat diet via its oxysterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol. Ablation or inhibition of CYP27A1, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in 27-hydroxycholesterol biosynthesis, significantly reduces metastasis in relevant animal models of cancer. The robust effects of 27-hydroxycholesterol on metastasis requires myeloid immune cell function, and it was found that this oxysterol increases the number of polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells at distal metastatic sites. The pro-metastatic actions of 27-hydroxycholesterol requires both polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells, and 27-hydroxycholesterol treatment results in a decreased number of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes. Therefore, through its actions on γδ-T cells and polymorphonuclear-neutrophils, 27-hydroxycholesterol functions as a biochemical mediator of the metastatic effects of hypercholesterolemia.High cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer recurrence. Here the authors show that cholesterol promotes breast cancer metastasis via its metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) that acts on immune myeloid cells residing at the distal metastatic sites, thus promoting an immune suppressive environment.</AbstractText>\n"

However, only a limited number of studies to investigate the importance of the subsets of T cells in TILs have been carried out, less so the significance of the location of these TILs. In this study, we explored in a cohort of 42 consecutive TNBC cases the prognostic significance of TIL subsets at the tumor-host interface (within 1 high-power field [0.5 mm] of the invasive front) and compared them with TILs within the intratumoral stroma. Given the reported importance of TILs in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, a subset of such tumors was also included for comparison. The range was wide in both locations; nevertheless, the mean CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell count was significantly higher at the tumor-host interface than that found within the intratumoral stroma (both P&lt;.0001). The number of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at either location was not significantly associated with distant relapse-free or overall survival. However, the CD4/CD8 ratio at the tumor-host interface was significantly associated with both relapse-free survival (hazard ratio 0.2, P=.002) and overall survival (hazard ratio 0.13, P=.002), whereas this association was not seen for the CD4/CD8 ratio within the intratumoral stroma. As expected, both tumor size and nodal status were significantly associated with survival outcomes. The findings further support the contention that TILs, as markers of regional immune escape, are of prognostic importance in TNBC progression and that the CD4/CD8 ratio of TILs at the tumor-host interface plays a distinctive role, thus appearing to be of clinical relevance.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we show that synaptopodin-2 (SYNPO2), a putative tumour suppressor in aggressive cancer, is frequently downregulated in TNBC by methylation of the promoter of SYNPO2. Low expression levels of SYNPO2 correlated significantly with 5-year metastatic relapse, and predicted poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Reintroduction of SYNPO2 inhibited the invasion and spontaneous metastasis of TNBC cells in vivo. Strikingly, downregulation of SYNPO2 is essential for the maintenance of stem cell-like properties in TNBC cells, leading to efficient distant colonization and metastasis outgrowth. Moreover, we demonstrate that SYNPO2 inhibits the activities of YAP and TAZ by stabilizing LATS2 protein, and transduction of YAP-S127A abrogates the repressive role of SYNPO2 in metastasis. Finally, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of breast cancer patient specimens indicated that the SYNPO2-LATS2-YAP axis is clinically relevant. These findings uncover a suppressive role of SYNPO2 in TNBC metastasis via inhibition of YAP/TAZ, and suggest that SYNPO2 might provide a potential prognosis marker and novel therapeutic strategy.

"28987136","2017/10/09 06:00","Radiation therapy and early breast cancer: current controversies.","<AbstractText>Radiation therapy (RT) is an important component of breast cancer treatment. RT reduces local recurrence and breast cancer mortality after breast conservation for all patients and for node-positive patients after a mastectomy. Short courses of RT over 3-4 weeks are generally as effective as longer courses. A patient subgroup where RT can be avoided after conservative surgery has not been consistently identified. A radiation boost reduces the risk of a recurrence in the breast but may be omitted for older patients with good prognosis tumours with clear margins. Axillary recurrences can take a long time to appear, with 35% occurring after 5 years. Leaving disease untreated in regional nodes is associated with reduced survival. Not all patients require radiation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a subsequent mastectomy. Modern RT equipment and techniques will further improve survival rates.</AbstractText>\n"

Whether patients suffering from malignancies, candidates for FP, have a normal ovarian capacity to respond to stimulation is controversial. Reduced responsiveness of antral follicle to exogenous FSH might be at play.

The expression level of CD16 and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) was detected by flow cytometry using specific antibodies. ADCC activity of expanded NK cells was estimated in trastuzumab treated breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and BT-474 cells.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">The ADAM17 inhibitor increased the purity of expanded NK cells to 90% after 14 days at 5 and 10 μM in vitro (p=0.043). However, the expansion rate of NK cells was decreased at 10 μM of the ADAM 17 inhibitor (p=0.043). Inhibition of ADAM10 suppressed the expansion of NK cells, although the NK purity was increased at 1 μM of the inhibitor. The expression of CD16 was significantly increased at 1 and 5 μM of the ADAM17 inhibitor (p=0.046, 0.028, respectively) during the culturing period. Inhibition of ADAM10 reduced the expression of CD16 on NK cells. The cytotoxic activity of the ADAM17 inhibitor treated NK cells against MCF-7 (p=0.039) and BT-474 (p=0.027) cells was significantly elevated.

After early concerns regarding its application in reconstruction after breast cancer (BC), in 2009 the American Society of Plastic Surgeons formed a task force to assess the indications, safety and efficacy of autologous fat grafting. We report the case of a woman who came to our attention for a painful swelling of the left breast. She had undergone breast-conserving therapy for BC, followed by lipofilling. The breast ultrasound (US) examination showed diffuse structural alteration and multiple hypoechoic areas with acoustic shadowing, mainly localized in the subcutaneous tissue. After pharmacological treatment and short-term follow-up US examination, considering the persistence of the clinical symptoms and structural alterations, we performed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, that showed multiple enhancing areas in the left breast. Suspecting local tumor recurrence, we carried out US-guided breast core-biopsy, whose histological examination documented liponecrosis. This observation raised a series of diagnostic and therapeutic issues highlighting the diagnostic pitfalls that the radiologist may encounter during the evaluation of patients who have undergone BC surgery and breast reconstruction through lipofilling.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, recent evidence suggests that extended endocrine treatment and ovarian suppression in selected groups of patients have significant advantages. In this article, we review the current evidence for adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer with focus on extended adjuvant endocrine therapy and ovarian suppression, and also highlight the advantages and disadvantages of these therapeutic strategies. A literature search was performed through PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane using the following search terms: Endocrine therapy, Tamoxifen, Anastrazole, Ovarian Suppression, Exemestane, Letrozole and STS Inhibitors. All available evidence for adjuvant endocrine therapy was reviewed and summarised to assess the current guidance and the progress of the management of patients with ER-positive breast cancer. Extended endocrine therapy should be tailored according to patient needs dictated by their individual risk factors, molecular type of breast cancer, menopausal status, comorbidities, life style and risk of recurrence. Clinicians ought to discuss with patients the pros and cons of different adjuvant endocrine therapy approaches and highlight the potential side effects and toxicity.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

To investigate the Doppler ultrasound (DUS)-CRT incidence, risk factors and outcomes in BC, we designed a prospective, multicenter cohort of nonmetastatic invasive BC patients undergoing insertion of a CVC for chemotherapy. All patients underwent double-blind DUS before, 7, 30, and 90 days after CVC insertion and a 6 months clinical follow-up. Symptomatic DUS-CRT were treated by anticoagulants. D-Dimers, thrombin generation, and platelet-derived microparticles were measured before and 2 days after CVC placement. In DUS-CRT patients, a nested case-control study analyzed the role of thrombophilia. Among 524 patients, the DUS-CRT (14 symptomatic, 46 asymptomatic) cumulative probability was 9.6% at 3 months and 11.5% at 6 months (overall incidence rate: 2.18/100 patient-months). Ten/14 symptomatic DUS-CRT were detected on double-blind DUS before the clinical symptoms, and 3/14 had a simultaneous pulmonary embolism. No clinical thrombotic event subsequently occurred in untreated asymptomatic DUS-CRT.

Molecular analyses have shown that breast cancer is divided into several subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] enriched, and basal-like), based on microarray techniques. Patients diagnosed as having breast cancer may undergo adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, depending on the tumor size, hormone receptor, HER2/neu status, and desire for breast preservation. Patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor status benefit from treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, based on menopausal status and risk of recurrence. HER2-targeted agents such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab are used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with HER2/neu breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is a unique subtype that lacks specific targets, and its treatment primarily includes chemotherapy.

Approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 40,610 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2017. From 2005 to 2014, overall breast cancer incidence rates increased among Asian/Pacific Islander (1.7% per year), non-Hispanic black (NHB) (0.4% per year), and Hispanic (0.3% per year) women but were stable in non-Hispanic white (NHW) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women. The increasing trends were driven by increases in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, which increased among all racial/ethnic groups, whereas rates of hormone receptor-negative breast cancers decreased. From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer death rates decreased by 39%, which translates to 322,600 averted breast cancer deaths in the United States. During 2006 to 2015, death rates decreased in all racial/ethnic groups, including AI/ANs. However, NHB women continued to have higher breast cancer death rates than NHW women, with rates 39% higher (mortality rate ratio [MRR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.43) in NHB women in 2015, although the disparity has ceased to widen since 2011. By state, excess death rates in black women ranged from 20% in Nevada (MRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) to 66% in Louisiana (MRR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.54, 1.79). Notably, breast cancer death rates were not significantly different in NHB and NHW women in 7 states, perhaps reflecting an elimination of disparities and/or a lack of statistical power. Improving access to care for all populations could eliminate the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality and accelerate the reduction in deaths from this malignancy nationwide.

How mechanical stimuli such as stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) contribute to MSC phenotype in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ECM stiffness leads to mechano-signal transduction in MSC, which promotes mammary tumor growth in part through secretion of the signaling protein prosaposin. On a stiff matrix, MSC cultured with conditioned media from mammary cancer cells expressed increased levels of α-smooth muscle actin, a marker of CAF, compared with MSC cultured on a soft matrix. By contrast, MSC cultured on a stiff matrix secreted prosaposin that promoted proliferation and survival of mammary carcinoma cells but inhibited metastasis. Our findings suggest that in addition to chemical stimuli, increased stiffness of the ECM in the tumor microenvironment induces differentiation of MSC to CAF, triggering enhanced proliferation and survival of mammary cancer cells. <i>Cancer Res; 77(22); 6179-89. ©2017 AACR</i>.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Methods MONARCH 3 is a double-blind, randomized phase III study of abemaciclib or placebo plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had no prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Patients received abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily continuous schedule) plus either 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily. The primary objective was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included response evaluation and safety. A planned interim analysis occurred after 189 events. Results Median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the abemaciclib arm (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.72; P = .000021; median: not reached in the abemaciclib arm, 14.7 months in the placebo arm). In patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate was 59% in the abemaciclib arm and 44% in the placebo arm ( P = .004). In the abemaciclib arm, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse effect (81.3%) but was mainly grade 1 (44.6%). Comparing abemaciclib and placebo, the most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (21.1% v 1.2%), diarrhea (9.5% v 1.2%), and leukopenia (7.6% v 0.6%). Conclusion Abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor was effective as initial therapy, significantly improving progression-free survival and objective response rate and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Here we report the identification of chromosomal copy-number amplification at 1q21.3 that is enriched in subpopulations of breast cancer cells bearing characteristics of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and that strongly associates with breast cancer recurrence. Amplification is present in ∼10-30% of primary tumors but in more than 70% of recurrent tumors, regardless of breast cancer subtype. Detection of amplification in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood is strongly associated with early relapse in patients with breast cancer and could also be used to track the emergence of tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We further show that 1q21.3-encoded S100 calcium-binding protein (S100A) family members, mainly S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9 (S100A7/8/9), and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) establish a reciprocal feedback loop driving tumorsphere growth. Notably, this functional circuitry can be disrupted by the small-molecule kinase inhibitor pacritinib, leading to preferential impairment of the growth of 1q21.3-amplified breast tumors. Our study uncovers the 1q21.3-directed S100A7/8/9-IRAK1 feedback loop as a crucial component of breast cancer recurrence, serving as both a trackable biomarker and an actionable therapeutic target for breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

In this study, bisphenol A (BPA), via triggering G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), stimulated cell proliferation and migration of bovine vascular endothelial cells (BVECs) and breast cancer cells (SkBr-3 and MDA-MB-231) and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, the expression of both hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were up-regulated in a GPER-dependent manner by BPA treatment under hypoxic condition, and the activated GPER induced the HIF-1α expression by competitively binding to caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and facilitating the release of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). These findings show that in a hypoxic microenvironment, BPA promotes HIF-1α and VEGF expressions through a shared GPER/Cav-1/HSP90 signaling cascade. Our observations provide a probable hypothesis that the effects of BPA on tumor development are copromoting relevant biological responses in both vascular endothelial and breast cancer cells.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The base-case analysis compared a scenario involving organized biennial screening with a scenario reflecting opportunistic screening practice for an average-risk woman aged 45 to 69 years. We applied an annual discount rate of 3% and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of the cost (2012 euros) per life-year gained (LYG) from a health care perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Compared with opportunistic screening, an organized program yielded on average additional 0.0118 undiscounted life-years (i.e., 4.3 days) and cost savings of €41 per woman.

Towards the end of 2014, EUSOMA decided to update the paper on QIs to consider and incorporate new scientific knowledge in the field. Several new QIs have been included to address the need for improved follow-up care of patients following primary treatments. With regard to the management of elderly patients, considering the complexity, the expert group decided that, for some specific quality indicators, if centres fail to meet the minimum standard, older patients will be excluded from analysis, provided that reasons for non-adherence to the QI are specified in the clinical chart and are identified at the review of the clinical records. In this way, high standards are promoted, but centres are able to identify and account for the effect of non-standard treatment in the elderly. In the paper, there is no QI for outcome measurements, such as relapse rate or overall survival. However, it is hoped that this will be developed in time as the databases mature and user experience increases. All breast centres are required to record outcome data as accurately and comprehensively as possible to allow this to occur. In the paper, different initiatives undertaken at international and national level to audit quality of care through a set of QIs have been mentioned.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In cultured cancer cells, AQP5 facilitates cell migration and activates Ras signaling. Both increased cell migration and Ras activation are associated with cancer metastasis, but so far it is unknown if AQP5 also affects these processes in vivo. Therefore, we investigated if high AQP5 expression in breast cancer tissue correlated with increased activation of Ras and of Rac1, which is a GTPase also involved in cell migration. This was accomplished by immunohistochemical analysis of invasive ductal carcinoma of breast tissue sections from human patients, followed by qualitative and quantitative correlation analysis between AQP5 and activated Ras and Rac1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that activation of Ras and Rac1 was positively correlated. There was, however, no correlation between high AQP5 expression and activation of Ras, whereas a nonsignificant, but positive, tendency between the levels of AQP5 and activated Rac1 levels was observed. In summary, this is the first report that correlates AQP5 expression levels to downstream signaling partners in breast cancer tissue sections. The results suggest Rac1 as a potential downstream signaling partner of AQP5 in vivo.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Chemotherapy-associated peripheral neuropathy (PN) is clinically important because of effects on quality of life (QOL) and potential effects on dose limitations. This adverse drug reaction is associated with certain classes of chemotherapy and commonly presents as peripheral sensory neuropathy whose natural course is largely unknown. The literature was reviewed to determine the frequency and characteristics of PN associated with adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) to explore the potential impact on long-term (one or more years after diagnosis) health outcomes and QOL. MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant English-language randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and case-control and cohort studies published between January 1990 and July 1996. Included studies were limited to current adjuvant regimens (eg, anthracyclines, taxanes, cyclophosphamide, platinum compounds). Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts, full-text articles, and extracted data from fair- and good-quality studies. Discrepancies in quality assessment and data extraction were resolved by consensus. We identified 364 articles; 60 were eligible for full-text review. Only five reports of four studies provided data beyond one year post-treatment initiation. Studies used different measures to assess PN. Neuropathic symptoms persisted in 11.0% to more than 80% of participants at one to three years following treatment. There is a paucity of data describing persistent PN in ESBC patients. Consistent use of validated measures and well-conducted randomized clinical trials or observational studies are needed to evaluate the incidence, persistence, and QOL associated with the long-term effects of PN.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

Patients underwent conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7-tesla breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) indication for systemic therapy was established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10-year risk-estimates of breast cancer mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online. Preoperative indication was estimated using similar guidelines, but from conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative and postoperative indication, and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on 31-phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative indication from preoperatively available data.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">We included 46 women (age: 43-74yrs) with 48 invasive carcinomas.

Using conventional workup, positive preoperative indication agreed excellently with positive postoperative indication (N = 8/8; 100%). Negative preoperative indication was correct in only 26/38 (68%) patients. However, 31P-MRS score (p = 0.030) and tumor size (p = 0.002) were associated with the postoperative indication.

A peptide-targeted tri-gadolinium nitride metallofullerene, ZD2-Gd<sub>3</sub>N@C80, is synthesised for sensitive molecular magnetic resonance imaging of extradomain-B fibronectin in aggressive tumours. ZD2-Gd<sub>3</sub>N@C80 has superior r <sub>1</sub> and r <sub>2</sub> relaxivities of 223.8 and 344.7 mM<sup>-1 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (1.5 T), respectively. It generates prominent contrast enhancement in aggressive MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer in mice at a low dose (1.7 µmol kg<sup>-1</sup>, 1 T), but not in oestrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 tumours. Strong tumour contrast enhancement is consistently observed in other triple negative breast cancer models, but not in low-risk slow-growing tumours. The dose of the contrast agent for effective molecular MRI is only slightly lower than that of ZD2-Cy5.5 (0.5 µmol kg<sup>-1</sup>) in fluorescence imaging. These results demonstrate that high-sensitivity molecular magnetic resonance imaging with ZD2-Gd<sub>3</sub>N@C80 may provide accurate detection and risk-stratification of high-risk tumours for precision healthcare of breast cancer.Molecular MRI is a powerful clinical tool for non-invasive detection of cancer biomarkers.

However, it is unknown whether radiation-specific molecular oncogenic mechanisms exist. We investigated post-Chernobyl breast cancers from radiation-exposed female clean-up workers and nonexposed controls for molecular changes. Radiation-associated alterations identified in the discovery cohort (n = 38) were subsequently validated in a second cohort (n = 39). Increased expression of hsa-miR-26b-5p was associated with radiation exposure in both of the cohorts. Moreover, downregulation of the TRPS1 protein, which is a transcriptional target of hsa-miR-26b-5p, was associated with radiation exposure. As TRPS1 overexpression is common in sporadic breast cancer, its observed downregulation in radiation-associated breast cancer warrants clarification of the specific functional role of TRPS1 in the radiation context. For this purpose, the impact of TRPS1 on the transcriptome was characterized in two radiation-transformed breast cell culture models after siRNA-knockdown. Deregulated genes upon TRPS1 knockdown were associated with DNA-repair, cell cycle, mitosis, cell migration, angiogenesis and EMT pathways. Furthermore, we identified the interaction partners of TRPS1 from the transcriptomic correlation networks derived from gene expression data on radiation-transformed breast cell culture models and sporadic breast cancer tissues provided by the TCGA database. The genes correlating with TRPS1 in the radiation-transformed breast cell lines were primarily linked to DNA damage response and chromosome segregation, while the transcriptional interaction partners in the sporadic breast cancers were mostly associated with apoptosis. Thus, upregulation of hsa-miR-26b-5p and downregulation of TRPS1 in radiation-associated breast cancer tissue samples suggests these molecules representing radiation markers in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

This indicates that at some point in the past, one of these cell lines became misidentified, meaning that it ceased to correspond to the reported donor and instead became falsely identified (through cross-contamination or other means) as a cell line from a different donor. Initial studies concluded that MDA-MB-435 was the misidentified cell line and M14 was the authentic cell line, although contradictory evidence has been published, resulting in further confusion. To address this question, we obtained early samples of the melanoma cell line (M14), a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same donor (ML14), and donor serum preserved at the originator's institution. M14 samples were cryopreserved in December 1975, before MDA-MB-435 cells were established in culture. Through a series of molecular characterizations, including short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and cytogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that later samples of M14 and MDA-MB-435 correspond to samples of M14 frozen in 1975, to the lymphoblastoid cell line ML14, and to the melanoma donor's STR profile, sex and blood type. This work demonstrates conclusively that M14 is the authentic cell line and MDA-MB-435 is misidentified. With clear provenance information and authentication testing of early samples, it is possible to resolve debates regarding the origins of problematic cell lines that are widely used in cancer research.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

In this study, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Women were included in the study if they were aged 66 to 80 years, newly diagnosed with stage I or II breast cancer, and enrolled in Medicare Parts A, B, and D during 2007 to 2011. Information on dispensed diabetes-related medications was obtained from Medicare Part D claims data. Our primary outcomes were second breast cancer events (SBCE), breast cancer recurrence, and breast cancer death. Time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate HRs and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 14,766 women included in the study, 791 experienced SBCE, 627 had a recurrence, and 237 died from breast cancer. Use of metformin (<i>n</i> = 2,558) was associated with 28% (95% CI, 0.57-0.92), 31% (95% CI, 0.53-0.90), and 49% (95% CI, 0.33-0.78) lower risks of an SBCE, breast cancer recurrence, and breast cancer death. Use of sulfonylureas or insulin was associated with 1.49- (95% CI, 1.00-2.23) and 2.58-fold (95% CI, 1.72-3.90) higher risks of breast cancer death.

The cells lose their physiologic phenotype and assumed a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by an increased migratory capacity, invasiveness and high resistance to apoptosis. In this process, RHO family regulates the activation or suppression of ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) which in turn regulates the cytoskeleton dynamics. However, while the biochemical mechanisms are widely investigated, a comprehensive and careful estimation of biomechanical changes has not been extensively addressed. In this work, we used a strong ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, to evaluate the effects of inhibition on living breast cancer epithelial cells by a biomechanical approach. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to estimate changes of cellular elasticity, quantified by Young's modulus parameter. The morphometric alterations were analyzed by AFM topographies and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Our study revealed a significant modification in the Young's modulus after treatment, especially as regards cytoskeletal region. Our evidences suggest that the use of Y-27632 enhanced the cell rigidity, preventing cell migration and arrested the metastasization process representing a potential powerful factor for cancer treatment.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Dwell positions and dwell times of the radiation source are established, relative to the patient's anatomy, from an initial X-ray-CT-image. During the irradiation treatment, catheter displacements can occur due to patient movements. The current study develops an automatic analysis tool of EMT data sets recorded with a solenoid sensor to assure concordance of the source movement with the treatment plan. The tool combines machine learning techniques such as multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and particle filter (PF) to precisely detect and quantify any mismatch between the treatment plan and actual EMT measurements. We demonstrate that movement artifacts as well as technical signal distortions can be removed automatically and reliably, resulting in artifact-free reconstructed signals. This is a prerequisite for a highly accurate determination of any deviations of dwell positions from the treatment plan.</AbstractText>\n"

We used three isogenic breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7 (with wild-type p53), 1001 (MCF7 with mutated p53), and MCF7-E6 (MCF7 in which p53 function was disrupted). MicroRNA expression was analyzed using microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The 1001 clone with mutant p53 showed 22 upregulated and 25 downregulated microRNAs. The predicted targets of these 47 microRNAs were &gt;700 human genes belonging to interesting functional groups such as stem cell development and maintenance. The most significantly downregulated microRNAs in the p53-mutant cell line were from the miR-200 family. We focused on miR-200c which targets many transcripts involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition including Moesin. We found that Moesin was expressed in 1001 but not in its p53 wild-type parental MCF7 consistent with the observed mesenchymal features in the 1001, such as vimentin positivity, E-cadherin negativity, and ZEB1 positivity in addition to the morphological changes. After Moesin silencing, the p53-mutant cells 1001 reverted from mesenchymal-to-epithelial phenotype and showed subtle reduction in migration and invasion and loss of ZEB1 and SNAIL expression. Interestingly, Moesin silencing restored the 1001 sensitivity to Doxorubicin. These results indicate that loss of miR-200c, as a consequence of p53 mutation, can upregulate Moesin oncogene and thus promote carcinogenesis. Moesin may play a role in metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

This optical imaging approach is sensitive, cost-effective, and does not involve any ionizing radiation. However, the image reconstruction of diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a nonlinear inverse problem and suffers from severe illposedness due to data noise, NIR light scattering, and measurement incompleteness. An image reconstruction method is proposed for the detection of breast cancer. This method splits the image reconstruction problem into the localization of abnormal tissues and quantification of absorption variations. The localization of abnormal tissues is performed based on a well-posed optimization model, which can be solved via a differential evolution optimization method to achieve a stable reconstruction. The quantification of abnormal absorption is then determined in localized regions of relatively small extents, in which a potential tumor might be. Consequently, the number of unknown absorption variables can be greatly reduced to overcome the underdetermined nature of DOT. Numerical simulation experiments are performed to verify merits of the proposed method, and the results show that the image reconstruction method is stable and accurate for the identification of abnormal tissues, and robust against the measurement noise of data.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>(2017) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).</CopyrightInformation>\n"

We performed a population-based, retrospective study of invasive breast cancer from the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme in Vestfold County (2004-2009), including 200 screen-detected and 82 interval cancers. Immunohistochemically CD163-positive macrophages were counted in the most active areas (hotspots) and dichotomized as high (upper quartile) and low counts. Lymphatic vessel involvement (LVI) and blood vessel invasion (BVI) were recorded separately based on immunohistochemical staining (D2-40 and CD31 antibodies). High levels of CD163-positive macrophages were associated with BVI and lymphatic involvement as well as interval cancer detection when compared to screening-detected tumors. In addition, the presence of high CD163+ TAM levels was more often observed in HER2-positive, basal-like and Triple-negative breast cancers and was associated with several features of aggressive tumors. In survival analyses, cases with combined high CD163 counts and BVI showed a significantly reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P &lt; .001 for both) compared with all other cases. The presence of CD163-positive, tumor-associated macrophages is strongly related to aggressive features of breast cancer such as vessel invasion, detection between screening intervals, non-luminal molecular subgroups and reduced survival.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Whole-body imaging can provide information across lesions within a patient. ER expression in tumor lesions can be visualized by <sup>18</sup>F-fluoroestradiol (<sup>18</sup>F-FES) PET, and AR expression has been visualized in prostate cancer patients with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodihydrotestosterone (<sup>18</sup>F-FDHT) PET. Our aim was to assess the concordance between <sup>18</sup>F-FDHT and <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET and tumor AR and ER expression measured immunohistochemically in patients with metastatic breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer were eligible for the study, irrespective of tumor AR status. The concordance of <sup>18</sup>F-FDHT and <sup>18</sup>F-FES uptake on PET with immunohistochemical expression of AR and ER in biopsies of corresponding metastases was analyzed. Patients underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FDHT PET and <sup>18</sup>F-FES PET. A metastasis was biopsied within 8 wk of the PET procedures. Tumor samples with more than 10% and 1% nuclear tumor cell staining were considered, respectively, AR- and ER-positive. Correlations between PET uptake and semiquantitative immunohistochemical scoring (percentage positive cells × intensity) were calculated. The optimum threshold of SUV to discriminate positive and negative lesions for both AR and ER was determined by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. <b>Results:</b> In the 13 evaluable patients, correlation (<i>R</i><sup>\n                        <i>2</i>\n                    </sup> ) between semiquantitative AR expression and <sup>18</sup>F-FDHT uptake was 0.47 (<i>P</i> = 0.01) and between semiquantitative ER expression and <sup>18</sup>F-FES uptake 0.78 (<i>P</i> = 0.01).

Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which is common in breast cancer, may be a key mechanism leading to the tumor progression. In this study, we studied whether a quantitative genetic definition of ITH can predict clinical outcomes in patients with TNBC. We quantified ITH by calculating Shannon index, a measure of diversity in a population, based on Myc, epidermal growth factor receptor/centromeric probe 7 (EGFR/CEP7) and cyclin D1/centromeric probe 11 (CCND1/CEP11) copy number variations (CNVs) in 300 cells at three different locations of a tumor. Among 75 TNBC patients, those who developed metastasis had significantly higher ITH, that is Shannon indices of EGFR/CEP7 and CCND1/CEP11 CNVs. Higher Shannon indices of EGFR/CEP7 and CCND1/CEP11 CNVs were significantly associated with the development of metastasis and were predictive of significantly worse metastasis-free survival (MFS). Regional heterogeneity, defined as the difference in copy numbers of Myc, EGFR or CCND1 at different locations, was found in 52 patients. However, the presence of regional heterogeneity did not correlate with metastasis or MFS. Our findings demonstrate that higher ITH of EGFR/CEP7 and CCND1/CEP11 CNVs is predictive of metastasis and is associated with significantly worse MFS in TNBC patients, suggesting that ITH is a very promising novel prognostic factor in TNBC.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

To certain extent, patients' access to care, which can be enhanced by increasing the coverage of health insurance, could account for the current underuse in recommended care. This study aimed to examine the association between different proportions of reimbursement and quality of recommended breast cancer care, as well as length of hospital stay. In this retrospective study, 3669 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1 June, 2011 and 30 June, 2013 were recruited. Seven quality indicators from preoperative diagnosis procedures to adjuvant therapy and one composite indicator were selected as dependent variables. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to explore the association between quality of care and length of hospital stay with different reimbursement rates. Compared with UEBMI (urban employment basic medical insurance), which represented high level reimbursement rate, patients with lower rates of reimbursement were less likely to receive core biopsy, HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) testing, BCS (breast conserving surgery), SLNB (sentinel lymph nodes biopsy), adjuvant therapy and hormonal treatment. No significant difference in preoperative length of hospital stay was observed among the three insurance schemes, however URBMI (urban resident basic medical insurance) insured patients stayed longer for total length of hospital stay. Significant disparities in utilization of evidence-based breast cancer care among patients with different proportions of reimbursement were observed. Patients with lower rate of reimbursement were less likely to receive recommended care.

In this study, we evaluated YAP expression immunohistochemically in 324 breast cancer tissues and correlated the expression with clinicopathological findings and patient survival data. Additionally, we reviewed the literature to clarify the role of YAP in breast cancer. We detected YAP, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER2) expression and a Ki67 labeling index &gt;20% in 53.4%, 49.0%, 45.0%, 28.3%, and 57.4% of invasive ductal carcinoma tissues, respectively. YAP is mainly localized within the tumor cell nuclei, and its expression was associated with the PR status and luminal A subtype. YAP expression also inversely correlated with the HER2 and Ki67 levels and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed associations of YAP expression with favorable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival in patients with luminal A breast cancer and with favorable DFS association among patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, luminal B (HER2-), and luminal B (HER2+) breast cancers. A multivariate Cox analysis revealed that YAP expression and PR status were independent favorable predictors of DFS and overall survival, respectively, among patients with breast cancer, whereas tumor-node-metastasis stage and an old age were independent predictors of a poor DFS. Our results, together with the literature review findings, suggest that YAP could be a prognostic marker in patients with breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Iron MRI detected high-iron pixel clusters in mammary tumors, lung metastasis, and brain metastasis as well as liver and spleen tissue known to contain the HLMs. Iron histology showed these regions to contain clustered macrophages identified by their common iron status and tissue-intrinsic association with other phenotypic macrophage markers. The in vivo MRI and ex vivo histological images were further processed to determine the frequencies and sizes of the iron deposits, and measure the number of HLMs in each deposit to estimate the in vivo MRI sensitivity for these cells. Hemosiderin accumulation is a macrophage biomarker and intrinsic contrast source for cellular MRI associated with the innate function of macrophages in iron metabolism systemically, and in metastatic cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Ruthenium (Ru) complexes with different ligands have been successfully studied as prospective antitumor drugs. In this work, we demonstrated the activity of a series of biphosphine bipyridine Ru complexes (1) [Ru(SO4)(dppb)(bipy)], (2) [Ru(CO3)(dppb)(bipy)], (3) [Ru(C2O4)(dppb)(bipy)] and (4) [Ru(CH3CO2)(dppb)(bipy)]PF6 [where dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane and bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine], on proliferation of TNBC (MDA-MB-231), estrogen-dependent breast tumor cells (MCF-7) and a non-tumor breast cell line (MCF-10A). Complex (4) was most effective among the complexes and was selected to be further investigated on effects on tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion and in apoptosis. Moreover, DNA and HSA binding properties of this complex were also investigated. Results show that complex (4) was more efficient inhibiting proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells over non-tumor cells. In addition, complex (4) was able to inhibit MDA-MB231 cells adhesion, migration and invasion and to induce apoptosis and inhibit MMP-9 secretion in TNBC cells.

This has led to increased public interest in supplemental screening, but radiologists have not come to a consensus on a supplemental screening modality. In choosing between the most common options, whole-breast ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, one must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each modality, as increased cancer detection may be accompanied by increased examination costs and biopsy rates. There has been recent interest in molecular breast imaging (MBI) for supplemental screening because of its high sensitivity, as well as its high specificity. This article describes how MBI fits into clinical practice alongside digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), targeted US, and MR imaging. The authors describe their approach to breast cancer screening, which uses DBT as the primary imaging modality. DBT is complemented by automated density calculations and supplemented with functional imaging techniques, including MR imaging or MBI, for women with dense breasts. An algorithm based on the patient's breast cancer risk is used to determine if either MR imaging or MBI for supplemental screening is appropriate. MBI is also used as a problem-solving tool for the evaluation of clinical indications following complex mammography or US, or for unexplained physical findings. This article describes aspects related to implementing MBI in clinical practice, including the clinical workflow, patient management, radioactive tracer administration, and procedure reimbursement. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017.</AbstractText>\n"

The prevalence of collective invasion and its contribution to distant metastasis in clinical disease, however, remains poorly defined. We here scored the adipose tissue invasion of primary invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), expressing E-cadherin, and E-cadherin negative invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and identified predominantly collective invasion patterns (86/86 samples) in both carcinoma types. Whereas collective invasion in IDC lesions retained adherens junctions, multicellular clusters and &quot;Indian files&quot; in ILC, despite the absence of adherens junctions (AJ) proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin, retained CD44 at cell-cell contacts. By histomorphological scoring and semi-automated image analysis, we show that the extent of collective invasion into the adipose tissue correlated with decreased distant metastasis-free survival (5-year follow-up; hazard ratio: 2.32 and 2.29, respectively). Thus, collective invasion represents the predominant invasion mode in breast cancer, develops distinct junctional subtypes in IDC and ILC, and associates with distant metastasis, suggesting a critical role in systemic dissemination.</AbstractText>\n"

An mRNA measurement, as a continuous value, has the potential for use in adjudication of the equivocal category. Here we use a real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay in a closed, single-use cartridge, automated system. Multiple cores (1 mm in diameter) were retrospectively collected from 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks with invasive breast cancer seen by Yale Pathology Labs between 1998 and 2011. Tissue cores were processed with a FFPE lysis kit to create lysates that were tested with the automated RT-qPCR assay. Results for IHC and FISH were extracted from the pathology reports and quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) for each case was measured as previously described. Quality control testing showed that the GX platform RT-qPCR shows no case to case cross contamination on material from routine histology practices. Concordance between RT-qPCR and IHC/FISH was 91.25% (sensitivity=0.87; specificity=0.94; PPV=0.89; NPV=0.92) using a pre-defined delta Ct cut-off (dCt≥-1) for HER2. Concordance (OPA) between RT-qPCR and QIF was 94% (sensitivity=0.90; specificity=0.96; PPV=0.93; NPV=0.94) using dCt≥-1 and a previously defined cut-point for positivity by QIF. In conclusion, the closed system RT-qPCR assay shows &gt;90% concordance with the ASCO/CAP HER2 IHC/FISH scoring. Additionally, the RT-qPCR assay is highly concordant (94%) with the continuous variable HER2 QIF assay, and may better reflect the true continuum of HER2 receptor status in invasive breast cancer. These initial results suggest that fast, closed system molecular assays may have future value for the adjudication of the ASCO/CAP HER2 equivocal category or possibly routine usage in time constrained or low resource settings.</AbstractText>\n"

Indication of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been extended to patients to evaluate the pathologic response and to offer more conservative breast surgery. Sentinel lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is feasible and accurate in patients with clinically node-negative patients. The timing of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, before or after medical treatment has been studied with benefits for each procedure. Sentinel lymph node dissection has been explored in different randomized prospective studies in clinically positive axilla with the aim of reduce axillary lymph node dissection. However, several studies are necessary to more accurately identify residual axillary disease and the sentinel lymph node after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to adjust the adjuvant radiotherapy protocols and to evaluate the impact on oncologic outcomes.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Société Française du Cancer.

The 18-gene scoring algorithm defines scores as: &lt;21, low risk; ≥21, high risk. Six hundred eighty-three patients with primary operable breast cancer and fresh frozen tumor tissues available were included. The primary outcome was the 5-year probability of freedom from distant metastasis (DMFP). Two external datasets were used to test the predictive accuracy of 18-GC. The 5-year rates of DMFP for patients classified as low-risk (n = 146, 21.7%) and high-risk (n = 537, 78.6%) were 96.2% (95% CI, 91.1%-98.8%) and 80.9% (74.6%-81.9%), respectively (median follow-up interval, 71.8 months). The 5-year rates of DMFP of the low-risk group in stage I (n = 62, 35.6%), stage II (n = 66, 20.1%), and stage III (n = 18, 10.3%) were 100%, 94.2% (78.5%-98.5%), and 90.9% (50.8%-98.7%), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that 18-GC is an independent prognostic factor of distant metastasis (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.1; p = 0.0017) for scores of ≥21. External validation showed that the 5-year rate of DMFP in the low- and high-risk patients was 94.1% (82.9%-100%) and 80.3% (70.7%-89.9%, p = 0.06) in a Singapore dataset, and 89.5% (81.9%-94.1%) and 73.6% (67.2%-79.0%, p = 0.0039) in the GEO-GSE20685 dataset, respectively.

Low tumor TLR9 expression has been associated with poor survival in Caucasian patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). African American (AA) patients with TNBC have worse prognosis than Caucasians but whether this is due to differences in tumor biology remains controversial. We studied the prognostic significance of tumor Toll like receptor-9 (TLR9) protein expression among African American (AA) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Germline TLR9 variants in European Americans (EAs) and AAs were investigated, to determine their contribution to AA breast cancer risk.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">TLR9 expression was studied with immunohistochemistry in archival tumors. Exome Variant Server and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to determine the genetic variation in the general EA and AA populations, and AA breast cancer cases.

EAs had more synonymous alleles, while AAs had more rare coding alleles. Similar analyses comparing AA breast cancer cases with AA controls did not reveal any variant class differences; however, three previously unreported TLR9 variants were associated with late onset breast cancer. Although not statistically significant, rs352140 was observed less frequently in AA cases compared to controls. Tumor TLR9 protein expression was not associated with prognosis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Tumor TLR9 expression is not associated with prognosis in AA TNBC.

Patients with primary T1-2N0-2M0 breast cancer, diagnosed between 1999 and 2012, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We investigated the 1999-2005 (long-term outcome) and the 2006-2012 cohort (contemporary adjuvant systemic therapy). Cause of death was derived from the Statistics Netherlands (CBS). Multivariable analyses, per time cohort, were performed in T1-2N0-2, and separately in T1-2N0-1 and T1-2N2 stages. The T1-2N0-1 stages were further stratified for age, hormonal receptor and HER2 status, adjuvant systemic therapy and comorbidity. In total, 129,692 patients were included. In the 1999-2005 cohort, better BCSS and OS for BCT than mastectomy was seen in all subgroups, except in patients &lt; 40 years with T1-2N0-1 stage. In the 2006-2012 cohort, superior BCSS and OS were found for T1-2N0-1, but not for T1-2N2. Subgroup analyses for T1-2N0-1 showed superior BCSS and OS for BCT in patients &gt;50 years, not treated with chemotherapy and with comorbidity. Both treatments led to similar BCSS in patients &lt;50 years, without comorbidity and those treated with chemotherapy. Although confounding by severity and residual confounding cannot be excluded, this study showed better long-term BCSS for BCT than mastectomy. Even with more contemporary diagnostics and therapies we identified several subgroups that may benefit from BCT. Our results support the hypothesis that BCT might be preferred in most breast cancer patients when both treatments are suitable.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic significance of expression of EMT-related miRNAs, miR-9 and miR-155, in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). We analyzed relative expression levels of miR-9 and miR-155 in 190 surgically resected TNBC specimens using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Then we analyzed the relationship between these miRNA expression levels and EMT marker expression (vimentin, smooth muscle actin [SMA], osteonectin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, CD146, and ZEB1) assessed by immunohistochemistry. We also evaluated the prognostic significance of these miRNA expression levels. While miR-9 expression level showed a positive correlation with pT category, miR-155 expression level did not correlate with any clinicopathologic features of TNBCs. In relation to EMT phenotype, miR-9 expression was not associated with EMT marker expression except for SMA. However, miR-155 expression level correlated inversely with the expression of several EMT markers including SMA, osteonectin, and CD146. We observed that both miR-9 and miR-155 could be prognostic markers in TNBC in opposite ways; high level of miR-9 expression showed significant association with poor disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in TNBC, while high level of miR-155 expression was associated with better DMFS. Our study suggests that expression levels of both miR-9 and miR-155 can serve as candidates for prognostic biomarkers in TNBCs.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although the invasion of the local lymphatic vessels and veins by malignant breast tumor cells and their subsequent metastasis to the lung, has been recognized, the mechanisms behind the metastatic activity of breast tumor cells to other distal organs and the pathogenesis of metastatic cancer are not well understood. In this study, we utilized derivatives of the well-established and highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) to study breast tumor metastasis in a mouse model. These MDA-231 derivatives had depleted expression of Kaiso, a POZ-ZF transcription factor that is highly expressed in malignant, triple negative breast cancers. We previously reported that Kaiso depletion attenuates the metastasis of xenografted MDA-231 cells. Herein, we describe the pathological features of the metastatic activity of parental (Kaisopositive) versus Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells. Both Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells metastasized from the original tumor in the mammary fat pad to the lung. However, while Kaisopositive cells formed large masses in the lung parenchyma, invaded large pulmonary blood vessels and formed secondary metastases and large tumors in the distal organs, Kaisodepleted cells metastasized only to the lung where they formed small metastatic lesions. Importantly, intravascular invasion and secondary metastases in distal organs were not observed in mice xenografted with Kaisodepleted cells. It thus appears that the lung may constitute a barrier for less invasive breast tumors such as the Kaisodepleted TNBC cells; this barrier may limit tumor growth and prevents Kaisodepleted TNBC cells from invading the pulmonary blood vessels and forming secondary metastases in distal organs.</AbstractText>\n"

Several studies have verified the non-inferiority of SPIO compared with the standard use of radioisotope <sup>99m</sup> Tc with or without blue dye. The aim of the MONOS study presented here was to evaluate the use of SPIO as a sole tracer and the efficacy of tracer injection in the preoperative setting.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">This prospective cohort study was carried out in two hospitals, one using <sup>99m</sup> Tc and the other SPIO. <sup>99m</sup> Tc was injected in the morning of the day of surgery or the day before. SPIO was either injected before surgery in the outpatient clinic or 1 h before the operation.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">A total of 338 consecutive patients with breast cancer underwent 343 procedures; SPIO nanoparticles were used in 184 procedures and <sup>99m</sup> Tc-labelled tracer in 159. Detection rates for SPIO and <sup>99m</sup> Tc were 95·6 and 96·9 per cent respectively (P = 0·537). All nodes with SPIO uptake were coloured brown. Fewer nodes were retrieved with SPIO (mean 1·35 versus 1·89), regardless of whether blue dye was used (P &lt; 0·001). Preoperative SPIO injection (58·7 per cent of procedures), a median of 16 (range 2-27) days before the procedure, was associated with a better tracer-specific detection rate (95·3 versus 86 per cent; P = 0·031) and retrieval of more nodes (mean 1·43 versus 1·03; P &lt; 0·001) than perioperative administration. Skin staining was present in 39·9 per cent of patients, and was related to breast-conserving surgery and periareolar injection.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The use of SPIO alone is a safe alternative, with results comparable to those of the standard dual technique using <sup>99m</sup> Tc and blue dye. The efficacy of injection in the preoperative setting simplifies logistics and improves performance. Skin staining can be prevented by a deeper peritumoral injection.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plaminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) have been the first biomarkers in hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer to reach highest level of evidence. The EndoPredict test (EPclin) combines gene expression information with nodal status and tumor size. The aim of this prospective study was to compare uPA/PAI-1 and EPclin as prognostic biomarkers with regard to feasibility, risk stratification and impact on adjuvant therapy recommendation.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"MATERIALS AND METHOD\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">395 patients with HR positive, HER2 negative, intermediate risk breast cancer were enrolled. Relations and concordance of histologic grading as well as EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 values were assessed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Cohen's Kappa. To compare decision impact of EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 three independent case discussions were held: One with known uPA/PAI-1 and EPclin results, one blinded to EPclin alone and another one blinded to both EPclin and uPA/PAI-1.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">EPclin could be determined in all 395 (100%), uPA/PAI-1 in 190 (48%) of the tumor samples. EPclin allocated 250 patients (63%) to the low-risk group and 145 patients (37%) to the high-risk group, whereas uPA/PAI-1 allocated 88 patients (46%) to the low-risk group and 102 patients (54%) to the high-risk group. In 59% of cases, both tests showed concordant results. EPclin resulted more frequently in a change of therapy recommendation than the uPA/PAI-1 test (46% vs 24%). Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) was abandoned twice as often by EPclin (45%) compared to uPA/PAI-1 (22%).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">In this first prospective comparison of EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 we found, that EPclin is superior to uPA/PAI-1 with respect to feasibility and decision impact. This leads to substantial avoidance of adjuvant CTX in endocrine-sensitive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Data collection for patients´ clinical outcome is ongoing.</AbstractText>\n"

As first-line treatment of HR+/HER2- MBC, the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor to an aromatase inhibitor improves progression-free survival compared to an aromatase inhibitor alone. Areas covered: In this drug profile, we review the current market for HR+/HER2- MBC, as well as the characteristics, mechanism, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, clinical efficacy, toxicities, monitoring, and dosing modification of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib. Expert commentary: CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as ribociclib, improve outcomes in post-menopausal women with HR+/HER2- MBC. The most common toxicity of ribociclib is neutropenia, which is generally not complicated and can be managed with dose modification and/or supportive care measures. Additional research will help better define the optimal clinical use of ribociclib.</AbstractText>\n"

Regular physical activity at moderate intensity is normally proposed to maintain myocardial performance; however, no data is available about the different impact of different levels of physical exercise. 2D speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) is an accepted method for early detection of myocardial dysfunction. The study aims to monitor the cardiac performances in breast cancer survivors by 2DSTE analysis to manage sports activity vs physical activity. Two groups of previous breast cancer survivors (33 BCS) trained at moderate intensity and 55 athletes practicing dragon boat (DBA) sport were enrolled. They were matched with two healthy subjects groups: 23 competitive female athletes practicing different sports and 20 healthy women trained with exercise as prescription model. All women were studied by a complete echo examination including LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) assessment (XStrain-Esaote). EF and GS are only significantly higher in healthy subjects (-25.4 ± 2.1). Nevertheless, GLS values are within the normal range for all groups. Particularly, GS does not show any significant differences among subjects (-19.93 ± 4) practicing exercise as prescription when compared to the DBA competitive trained group. 2DSTE method is an appropriate method to supervise the intensity of exercise in breast cancer patients. Particularly, GLS can optimize and improve cancer therapy supporting and creating efficiencies within the health system confirming the role of the exercise prescription therapy in maintaining normal heart function.</AbstractText>\n"

Yet, the protective effect of sunitinib against breast cancer has been poorly investigated. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and apoptogenic effects of sunitinib and the possible mechanism involved against the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line. Treatment of MCF7 cells with sunitinib caused concentration-dependent cell growth suppression due to apoptosis. Apoptotic death induced by sunitinib in MCF7 cells was mediated by activation of caspase-3 and p53 mRNA and protein expression and an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (40%) as determined by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was associated with a significant inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B mRNA and protein expression. Mechanistically, blocking of de novo RNA synthesis by actinomycin D significantly inhibited sunitinib-induced expression of p53 mRNA, but not that of caspase-3, indicating involvement of a transcriptional mechanism. This apoptosis-mediated inhibition of MCF7 cell growth was attributed to inhibition of cell cycle-related genes (cyclin D1 and cyclin E2) and arrest of MCF7 cells in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase in the cell cycle, allowing up-regulation of expression of DNA repair genes such as x-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1. In addition, sunitinib exhibited concentration-dependent induction of oxidative stress genes (heme oxygenase 1 and glutathione transferase A1) through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway. These findings lead us to propose that sunitinib suppressed the proliferation of MCF7 cells via cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic- and oxidative stress-mediated pathways.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

For critical decision making regarding the fate of cancerous breast tissue, the assessment of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement is required. However, such ALN involvement is difficult to predict without surgical intervention. Therefore, an easy predictive test using protein markers may be a desirable approach. In this study, we performed a whole proteome analysis to reveal the presence of a putative biomarker panel using primary breast tumor tissue. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Proteins were extracted from tumor tissues and were subjected to two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. The resulting gel images were used for inter-gel spot comparisons using PDQuest Advance software. The paterns thus obtained were used for differentiating invasive tumor types from non-invasive ones. <b>Results:</b> The analysis of 2D gel images revealed the presence of 24 conserved protein spots whose intensities were moderately regulated high on the gels.

This is the key for a good long term disease control and for a management with curative intent. The local recurrence in breast cancer appears after breast conserving treatment (BCT) or after mastectomy, and the regional recurrence involves the ipsilateral axillary, internal mammary or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Local recurrence prognosis after BCT seems to be better than after mastectomy regarding distant metastases occurrence and overall survival. Prognosis of axillary recurrence is better than prognosis of supraclavicular and internal mammary recurrence. Locoregional recurrence in breast cancer represents rather a marker for the appearance of distant metastases than a determinant factor for them. Management options for locoregional recurrence of cancer require multidisciplinary input decision making and for this reason the multidisciplinary tumor-board (MTD) is very important.

Despite emergence of several prognosticators for better management of patients, there are still limitations for their clinical application due to the complexity of breast tumors, and therefore, new biomarkers for better prognosis of clinical outcomes would be of the great essence. MicroRNAs are highly conserved small non-coding regulatory RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulating of gene expression during different cellular mechanisms. Accumulating studies suggest that miR-218 plays a multifunctional role in various cancer types and different stages. Here, to address prognostic significance of miR-218 in breast cancer, we investigate the expression profile of miR-218 and B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 ( BMI1) gene, as one of the putative targets of miR-218, in 33 paired breast tumors and their adjacent normal tissues with respect to the clinicopathological features of patients using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The correlation of both miR-218 and BMI1 gene expression with overall survival of breast cancer patients was also examined recruiting OncoLNC data portal. Finally, to better understand biological function of miR-218 in breast cancer, we performed in silico Gene Ontology and signaling pathway enrichment analysis on miR-218 targetome. According to our data, significant elevation of the expression of miR-218 and downregulation of BMI1 were observed in clinical breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissues ( p &lt; 0.0001). The lower expression of miR-218 was associated with lymph node metastases, higher grades, and poorer prognosis (logrank p = 0.00988), whereas no significant difference in overall survival was observed between patients with higher and lower expression of BMI1 (logrank p = 0.254). These findings suggest that miR-218 expression profiling might be clinically applicable as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. In addition, our in silico enrichment analyses revealed that the association of miR-218 expression with breast cancer prognosis might be through its involvement in endocytosis and gap junction biological pathways.</AbstractText>\n"

Patients and Methods We performed a phase I study of oral Z-endoxifen to determine its toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity. Eligibility included endocrine-refractory, estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. An accelerated titration schedule was applied until moderate or dose-limiting toxicity occurred, followed by a 3+3 design and expansion at 40, 80, and 100 mg per day. Tumor DNA from serum (circulating cell free [cf); all patients] and biopsies [160 mg/day and expansion]) was sequenced. Results Of 41 enrolled patients, 38 were evaluable for MTD determination. Prior endocrine regimens during which progression occurred included aromatase inhibitor (n = 36), fulvestrant (n = 21), and tamoxifen (n = 15). Patients received endoxifen once daily at seven dose levels (20 to 160 mg). Dose escalation ceased at 160 mg per day given lack of MTD and endoxifen concentrations &gt; 1,900 ng/mL. Endoxifen clearance was unaffected by CYP2D6 genotype. One patient (60 mg) had cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity (pulmonary embolus). Overall clinical benefit rate (stable &gt; 6 months [n = 7] or partial response by RECIST criteria [n = 3]) was 26.3% (95% CI, 13.4% to 43.1%) including prior tamoxifen progression (n = 3). cfDNA mutations were observed in 13 patients ( PIK3CA [n = 8], ESR1 [n = 5], TP53 [n = 4], and AKT [n = 1]) with shorter progression-free survival ( v those without cfDNA mutations; median, 61 v 132 days; log-rank P = .046). Clinical benefit was observed in those with ESR1 amplification (tumor; 80 mg/day) and ESR1 mutation (cfDNA; 160 mg/day). Comparing tumor biopsies and cfDNA, some mutations ( PIK3CA, TP53, and AKT) were undetected by cfDNA, whereas cfDNA mutations ( ESR1, TP53, and AKT) were undetected by biopsy.

Identifying these germline mutations in a woman with breast cancer is important because it can influence her immediate and long-term management and has important implications for other family members. Areas covered: This review highlights how treatment-focussed genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can potentially influence cancer treatment and secondary prevention decisions in women with breast cancer. Expert commentary: Testing women with breast cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations has the potential to decrease cancer burden and improve cancer outcomes. It can help optimise surgical and systemic therapy approaches. Clinicians should actively consider whether genetic testing is appropriate for each woman with breast cancer, and if so should instigate it early in the treatment trajectory when it can most influence cancer care.</AbstractText>\n"

The original therapeutic recommendation was based on the MP and would have been changed in 38% of the patients following EP test results. 4 patients developed distant metastases. The respective tumours of these patients were all classified as high risk by the EP, but only 3 were classified as high risk by the MP.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Both tests resulted in different treatment recommendations for a significant proportion of patients and cannot be used interchangeably. The results underscore the urgent need for further comparative analyses of multi-genomic tests to avoid misclassification of disease recurrence risk in breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"

The aim of this study is to define quantitative action levels for DGART by evaluating changes in 3D dose metrics in breast cancer and correlate them with clinical expert evaluation.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"MATERIAL AND METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Twenty-three breast cancer treatment plans were evaluated, that were clinically adapted based on institutional IGRT guidelines. Reasons for adaptation were variation in seroma, hematoma, edema, positioning or problems using voluntary deep inspiration breath hold. Sixteen patients received a uniform dose to the breast (clinical target volume 1; CTV1). Six patients were treated with a simultaneous integrated boost to CTV2. The original plan was copied to the CT during treatment (re-CT) or to the stitched cone-beam CT (CBCT). Clinical expert evaluation of the re-calculated dose distribution and extraction of dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were performed. The extreme scenarios were evaluated, assuming all treatment fractions were given to the original planning CT (pCT), re-CT or CBCT. Reported results are mean ± SD.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">DVH results showed a mean dose (Dmean) difference between pCT and re-CT of -0.4 ± 1.4% (CTV1) and -1.4 ± 2.1% (CTV2). The difference in V95% was -2.6 ± 4.4% (CTV1) and -9.8 ± 8.3% (CTV2). Clinical evaluation and DVH evaluation resulted in a recommended adaptation in 17/23 or 16/23 plans, respectively. Applying thresholds on the DVH parameters: D<sub>mean</sub> CTV, V95% CTV, D<sub>max</sub>, mean lung dose, volume exceeding 107% (uniform dose) or 90% (SIB) of the prescribed dose enabled the identification of patients with an assumed clinically relevant dose difference, with a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 1.0. Re-calculation on CBCT imaging identified the same plans for adaptation as re-CT imaging.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Clinical expert evaluation can be related to quantitative DVH parameters on re-CT or CBCT imaging to select patients for DGART.</AbstractText>\n"

The timing of pubertal growth-as measured by age at menarche and age at attained height-may also influence risk. We evaluated associations of adult height, age at attained height, and age at menarche with incidence of invasive breast cancer in 55,687 African American women in the prospective Black Women's Health Study. Over 20 years, 1,826 invasive breast cancers [1,015 estrogen receptor (ER) positive; 542 ER negative] accrued. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with breast cancer overall and by ER status, mutually adjusted for the three factors of interest. Adult height was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR for ≥70 inches vs ≤63 inches: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.89) but not ER- (corresponding HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.71) (p heterogeneity = 0.34).

Results for age at menarche (≤11 vs ≥14 years) were similar for ER+ and ER- breast cancer (HR for breast cancer overall: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.50). We confirmed height as a strong risk factor for ER+ breast cancer in African American women and identified early age at attained height as a risk factor for both ER+ and ER- breast cancer, albeit without statistical significance of the latter associations. While adult height and timing of pubertal growth are inter-related, our findings suggest that they may be independent risk factors for breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

We describe the cases of two women diagnosed with breast cancer who developed incomplete AFF associated with BMAs prescribed for bone metastases. Radiographs of their femurs revealed thickening of the lateral subtrochanteric cortex, and tomosynthesis revealed a visible fracture line in the thickened cortex. They were initially treated with conservative management; however, the incomplete fracture resulted in a complete fracture. These cases highlight two major implications. First, symptomatic incomplete AFF associated with BMAs prescribed for bone metastases should be treated with surgical prophylaxis, given the fact that fracture healing is expected to require a longer duration and an incomplete fracture might potentially progress to a complete fracture during long-term conservative management. Second, tomosynthesis is useful in identifying radiolucent fracture lines that are reliable predictors of fracture propagation.</AbstractText>\n"

Effective home-based multidimensional programmes for breast cancer survivors have gained an ever greater emphasis in survivorship care to maximise women's quality of life for their successful transition to rehabilitation and normal life. It is important to summarise the best available evidence to evaluate the effects of home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes on quality of life in women within 10 years of the completion of surgery or adjuvant cancer therapy for breast cancer, or both.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"OBJECTIVES\">To assess the effects of home-based, multidimensional survivorship (HBMS) programmes on maintaining or improving the quality of life in breast cancer survivors.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"SEARCH METHODS\">In April 2016 we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened reference lists of all identified studies and contacted study authors.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"SELECTION CRITERIA\">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of HBMS programmes in maintaining or improving quality of life in women with stages 0 to 3 breast cancer who completed primary cancer treatment (surgery or adjuvant cancer therapy, or both) up to 10 years earlier. We considered studies where the interventions included more than one of the following listed components: educational (such as information provision and self-management advice), physical (such as exercise training and resistance training) and psychological (such as counselling and cognitive therapies), to constitute a multidimensional programme. Interventions had to be allowed to be carried out at home.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\">Two authors independently assessed eligible studies for inclusion, and performed quality assessment and extracted relevant data of the included studies. Quality of life was the primary outcome of the review.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"MAIN RESULTS\">We included 22 RCTs and four quasi-RCTs on 2272 participants. We categorised the intervention components into four groups: educational and psychological; educational and physical; physical and psychological; and educational, physical and psychological. Most of the studies used usual care (routine medical follow-up services) as the comparator. A few studies used a lower level or different type of intervention (e.g. stress management or exercise) or attention control as the comparator.We used the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT B), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life C30 (EORTC C30), Quality of Life (QoL) Breast Cancer, and SF36 questionnaires to assess quality of life. HBMS programmes may increase breast cancer-specific quality of life and global quality of life immediately after the intervention, as measured by FACT-B and EORTC C30 (FACT-B: mean difference (MD) 4.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.33 to 6.78, 7 studies, 764 participants; EORTC: MD 4.38, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.64, 6 studies; 299 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in quality of life as measured by QoL-Breast Cancer or SF-36 (QoL-Breast Cancer: MD 0.42, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.85, 2 studies, 111 participants, very low-quality evidence; physical composite score SF36: MD 0.55, 95% CI -3.52 to 4.63, 2 studies, 308 participants, low-quality evidence).We observed a similar pattern at one to three months after the intervention: FACT-B (MD 6.10, 95% CI 2.48 to 9.72, 2 studies, 426 participants), EORTC-C30 (MD 6.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 12.04, 2 studies; 172 participants) and QoL-Breast Cancer (MD 0.45, 95% CI -0.19 to 1.09, 1 study, 61 participants). At four to six months and 12 months, there was no evidence of a difference in quality of life between groups (four to six months: EORTC - MD 0.08, 95% CI -7.28 to 7.44, 2 studies; 117 participants; SF-36 - MD -1.05, 95% CI -5.60 to 3.51, 2 studies, 308 participants; 12 months: EORTC - MD 2.04, 95% CI -9.91 to 13.99, 1 study; 57 participants).Functional status was incorporated into the quality of life subscale findings. HBMS programmes may decrease anxiety (MD of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -1.01, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.08, 5 studies, 253 participants, low-quality evidence) compared to control immediately after the intervention but the effect did not persist at four to six months. There was no evidence of improvements in depression immediately after HBMS (MD of HADS -1.36, 95% CI -2.94 to 0.22, 4 studies, 213 participants, low-quality evidence) or at follow-up. HBMS programmes may also decrease fatigue (MD -1.11, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.45, 3 studies, 127 participants; low-quality evidence) and insomnia (MD -1.81, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.27, 3 studies, 185 participants, low-quality evidence).None of the included studies reported service needs and utilisation and cost of care, and therefore the effect of HBMS programmes on healthcare utilisation and cost is unknown. Due to the variations in assessment methods of adherence among the eight studies, we could not combine the results for meta-analysis. We synthesised the results narratively, with the reported adherence rates of 58% to 100%.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\">The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that HBMS programmes in breast cancer survivors appear to have a short-term beneficial effect of improving breast cancer-specific quality of life and global quality of life as measured by FACT-B and EORTC-C30, respectively. In addition, HBMS programmes are associated with a reduction in anxiety, fatigue and insomnia immediately after the intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence across studies as moderate for some outcomes, meaning that we are fairly confident about the results, while we assessed other outcomes as being low-quality, meaning that we are uncertain about the result.</AbstractText>\n"

The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor, keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI), and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly available data to better understand causal mechanisms.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Therefore, novel agents or new routes need to be developed to improve treatment efficacy and diminish severe side-effects of anti-cancer agents in TNBC patients. This study explores a novel localized co-delivery platform with potential application against TNBC. Uniform core-shell microparticles encapsulating cisplatin (Cis-DDP) and paclitaxel (PTX) are fabricated using coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization technique and subsequently are embedded into an injectable hydrogel. The hydrogel provides an additional diffusion barrier against Cis-DDP and confines premature release of drugs. In addition, the hydrogel can provide a versatile tool for retaining particles in the tumor resected cavity during the injection following debulking surgery and prevent surgical site infection due to its inherent antibacterial properties. The combination of Cis-DDP and PTX demonstrates a synergistic effect against MDA-MB-231 cell line assigned to three different mechanisms of action, including denaturation of DNA strands, stabilization of microtubules, and amplification of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of caspase-3 pathways. The results show a significant accumulation of mitochondrial ROS insults in cells upon treatment that consequently causes programmed cells death. The performance of microparticles/hydrogel carrier is evaluated against three-dimensional MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) 3D spheroids, where a superior efficacy and a greater reduction in spheroid growth are observed over 14 days, as compared with free-drug treatment. Overall, drug-loaded core-shell microparticles embedded into injectable hydrogel provides a promising strategy to treat aggressive cancers and a modular platform for a broad range of localized multidrug therapies customizable to the cancer type.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Improvement of the prognosis of patients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor of recurrence, which would make it possible to provide beneficial personalized treatment. However, no clinically reliable predictive factor is currently known. In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor of TNBC recurrence. A future prospective study investigating whether personalized therapy based on PC (32:1) intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC is recommended.</AbstractText>\n"

Surrogate classification of intrinsic subtypes of invasive carcinomas by combined immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and Ki67 (4-IHC) has increased steadily since the 2011 St Gallen symposium, due to its rapid subtyping of tumors at a reasonable cost. An important step in improving 4-IHC reproducibility and reliability will be to provide reference values from the routine use of standardized 4-IHC followed by image analysis. The aims of the current study were (1) to analyze invasive breast carcinomas using standardized 4-IHC and quantitative image analysis and (2) to compare the results obtained in the classification of biological subtypes using current Ki67 and PR threshold values proposed by different authors to sub-classifying the luminal A-like and the luminal B-like (HER2-negative) subtypes. Five hundred twenty-one tumors were analyzed by standardized immunohistochemistry, with automatic image analysis, and HER2 FISH technique. Positivity for ER was found in 82.7% and for PR in 70.1% of cases. Using the Allred scoring system, hormone receptor results showed a bimodal distribution, particularly for ER. HER2 positivity was found in 15.7% of cases, and the mean Ki67 score was 32.3%. Using the most recently proposed surrogate definitions for the classification of luminal breast cancer subtypes, the percentages of different subtypes that we found were similar to those published with genomic platforms: 40.7% luminal A-like, 32.4% luminal B-like/HER2-negative, 9.8% luminal B-like/HER2-positive, 6.0% HER2-positive, and 11.1% triple negative. Standardized 4-IHC with automatic image analysis constitutes a low-cost method for surrogate definitions of biological subtypes of breast cancer that delivers accurate results in a day.</AbstractText>\n"

Additionally, we determined regional rates of &quot;healthcare intensity&quot;, including spending on tests and procedures, and intensity of end-of-life care. Pearson correlations of adjusted rates were calculated within HRRs.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">The mean adjusted rate of PSA screening was 22%. The mean age of screened and unscreened patients was 75.0 and 77.4 years, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). The mean adjusted rate of screening mammography was 23%; mean ages of screened and non-screened women were 79.95 and 83.67, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). HRR-level PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography rates (r=0.06, p=0.31). PSA screening rates were associated with spending on testing and procedures (r=0.42, p&lt;0.0001) and various measures of intensity of EOL care (e.g. r=0.40, p&lt;0.0001 for mechanical ventilator use). Screening mammography had low correlation with both health care spending and EOL care intensity measures (all r-values &lt;0.3).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Regional rates of PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography, thus these practices appear to be driven by different factors. Unlike mammography, PSA screening was associated with local enthusiasm for testing and treatment. Efforts to reduce over-testing should contemplate these practices differently, and future research should examine the factors motivating these screening practices.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite decades of medical research, less than 30% of cases with a suggestive personal and/or family history of hereditary breast cancer have an identified causative gene mutation. The vast majority of these cases are due to a mutation in one of the highly penetrant breast cancer genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, and STK11) and various guidelines direct the management of these patients. A minority of cases are due to mutations in moderate-penetrance genes (PALB2, ATM, BRIP1, and CHEK2). A small number of low-penetrance alleles have been identified using advanced genetic testing methods. While these may contribute to risk in a polygenic fashion, this is likely to be relevant to a minority of cases and their identification should not be considered routine practice. Mutation testing currently requires a high index of suspicion for a specific contributing etiology, but next-generation sequencing may improve the identification of such genes and the clinical management of these cases. Where no genetic susceptibility is identified, lifetime breast cancer risk can be calculated with standard tools. Breast cancer risk management then depends on the calculated lifetime risk. The psychological consequences of such screening for mutation carriers and non-carriers are discussed.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 125 patients who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2015 at our institution were included from the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium study database. Adjusted multivariate models were created incorporating RT technical data, age, cancer stage, estrogen receptor, chemotherapy, breast size, body mass index, and income to determine whether RT was associated with outcomes.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">At 1 year after surgery, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire breast symptoms were significantly greater in 64 patients who received RT (8-point difference on 100-point ordinal scale, P&lt;.0001) versus 61 who did not receive RT in univariate and multivariate models. EORTC arm symptoms (20-point difference on 100-point ordinal scale, P=.0200) differed on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis. All other outcomes-including Numerical Pain Rating Scale, BREAST-Q (Post-operative Reconstruction Module), Patient-Report Outcomes Measurement Information System Profile 29, McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF) score, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-were not statistically different between groups.

However, most breast cancers are resistant to monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to have a number of immunostimulatory effects, including priming the immune system, recruiting immune cells to the tumor environment, and altering the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment. RT therefore represents a promising adjuvant therapy to checkpoint blockade in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS AND MATERIALS\">We review the data from the checkpoint blockade studies on breast cancer reported to date, the mechanisms by which RT potentiates immune responses, the preclinical and clinical data of checkpoint blockade and RT combinations, and the landscape of current clinical trials of RT and immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Clinical trials with checkpoint blockade therapy have demonstrated response rates of up to 19% in breast cancer, and many of the responses are durable. Preclinical data indicate that RT combined with checkpoint inhibition synergizes not only to enhance antitumor efficacy but also to induce responses outside of the radiation field. Thus multiple clinical trials are currently investigating the combination of checkpoint inhibition with RT.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The use of combination strategies that incorporate chemotherapy and/or local strategies such as RT may be needed to augment responses to immune therapy in breast cancer.

The association of maghemite-rhodium citrate (MRC) nanoparticles (NPs) has the potential to increase specificity of the cytotoxic action. However, the interaction of these NPs with cells, their uptake mechanism, and subcellular localization need to be elucidated. This work evaluates the uptake mechanism of MRC NPs in metastatic and nonmetastatic breast cancer-cell models, comparing them to a nontumor cell line. MRC NPs uptake in breast cancer cells was more effective than in normal cells, with regard to both the amount of internalized material and the achievement of more strategic intracellular distribution. Moreover, this process occurred through a clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway with different basal expression levels of this protein in the cell lines tested.</AbstractText>\n"

The Dutch guideline suggests use of validated gene-expression profiles in patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive, early-stage breast cancer without overt lymph node metastases. We aimed to assess the impact of a 70-gene signature (70-GS) test on CT decisions in patients with ER-positive, early-stage breast cancer. Patients and Methods In a prospective, observational, multicenter study in patients younger than 70 years old who had undergone surgery for ER-positive, early-stage breast cancer, physicians were asked whether they intended to administer adjuvant CT before deployment of the 70-GS test and after the test result was available. Results Between October 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, 660 patients, treated in 33 hospitals, were enrolled. Fifty-one percent of patients had pT1cN0, BRII, HER2-Neu-negative breast cancer. On the basis of conventional clinicopathological characteristics, physicians recommended CT in 270 (41%) of the 660 patients and recommended withholding CT in 107 (16%) of the 660 patients. For the remaining 43% of patients, the physicians were unsure and unable to give advice before 70-GS testing. In patients for whom CT was initially recommended or not recommended, 56% and 59%, respectively, were assigned to a low-risk profile by the 70-GS (κ, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.11). After disclosure of the 70-GS test result, the preliminary advice was changed in 51% of patients who received a recommendation before testing; the definitive CT recommendation of the physician was in line with the 70-GS result in 96% of patients. Conclusion In this prospective, multicenter study in a selection of patients with ER-positive, early-stage breast cancer, 70-GS use changed the physician-intended recommendation to administer CT in half of the patients.</AbstractText>\n"

"28807821","2017/08/16 06:00","POPDC1 is suppressed in human breast cancer tissues and is negatively regulated by EGFR in breast cancer cell lines.","<AbstractText>Breast cancer molecular heterogeneity has resulted in disparities in therapeutic response and targeting of molecular subtypes of breast cancer. This necessitates identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. Suppression of Popeye domain-containing (POPDC) proteins is hypothesized to promote malignant cell behaviour and poor clinical outcomes in various cancers. We aimed to determine whether POPDC proteins are suppressed in human ductal carcinoma tissues and if this correlates to clinical progression and Her2 status. We further assessed if the EGFR regulated POPDC1 in breast cancer. Here we show significant suppression of POPDC1 in malignant breast cancer tissues without correlation to clinical progression. Interestingly, POPDC2 and POPDC3 were highly expressed in malignant breast tissues. Furthermore, HER2+ status significantly correlated with high POPDC2 and POPDC3, but not POPDC1 expression. We further show for the first time that low POPDC1 correlates to high EGFR expression in breast cancer tissues and that EGFR negatively regulates POPDC1 expression in MCF7, MDA231 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of POPDC1 in MCF7, MDA231 and SKBR3 cells attenuated EGF-mediated cell migration and proliferation. These findings show that POPDC1 is suppressed in breast cancer and can potentially be targeted to inhibit EGFR-mediated cell migration and proliferation.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Crown Copyright © 2017.

Most patients were previously treated with docetaxel and/or epirubicin. Patients were intravenously treated with BV at 5-10mg/kg and PTX at 3-5mg/kg at 2-3week intervals, and when the effect of BV-PTX was low, other chemotherapeutic agents(CTAs)and/or trastuzumab (Tr)were additionally administered. Twelve MBC patients were treated with BV-PTX alone and 19 MBC patients were treat- ed with other CTAs and/or Tr in addition to BV-PTX. No serious adverse events were observed in any regimen. Three complete responses(9.7%), 4 partial responses(12.9%), 8 stable diseases(25.8%), and 16 progressive diseases(51.6%)were observed; the response rate was 22.6%, and the clinical benefit rate was 48.4%. The median progression-free survival(PFS) and median overall survival(OS)after the initiation of BV-PTX were 7.0 and 16.0 months, respectively. All 13 HER2-positive MBC patients were treated with Tr in addition to BV-PTX, and the OS and PFS were significantly higher in the BV-PTX+Tr+ CTAs group than in the BV-PTX+Tr group. In 18 HER2-negative MBC patients, PFS and OS were better in the BV-PTX+CTAs group than in the BV-PTX alone group, though this difference was not significant. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that an additional CTAs was a variable for significantly better PFS, and additional CTAs, Tr, and endocrine therapy were significant variables for better OS.

However, there have been limited data regarding diagnostic performances. Purpose To evaluate diagnostic performances of supplemental breast US screening for women with PHBC and to compare with those for women without PHBC. Material and Methods Between 2011 and 2012, 12,230 supplemental US exams were performed in 12,230 women with negative mammograms: 6584 women with PHBC and 5646 women without PHBC. Cancer detection rate, interval cancer rate, abnormal interpretation rate, positive predictive values (PPVs), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated and compared. Results Overall cancer detection rate and first-year interval cancer rate were 1.80/1000 exams and 0.91/1000 negative exams, both of which were higher in women with PHBC than in women without PHBC (2.88 vs. 0.53 per 1000, P = 0.003; 1.50 vs. 0.20 per 1000, P = 0.027). Abnormal interpretation rate was lower in the women with PHBC than in women without PHBC (9.1% vs. 12.1%, P &lt; 0.001).

Three in vitro cell-based assays were used: the cell proliferation assay, tube-formation assay, and Western blot analysis. Both the ICF-1 extract and cirsimaritin inhibited the viability of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition achieved was 36.89% at a level of 200μg/ml by the ICF-1 extract and 62.04% at a level of 100μM by cirsimaritin. The ICF-1 extract and cirsimaritin reduced tube formation by 12.69% at level of 25μg/ml and 32.18% at the levels of 6.25μM, respectively. Cirsimaritin inhibited angiogenesis by downregulation of VEGF, p-Akt and p-ERK in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that cirsimaritin is potentially useful as an anti-metastatic agent.

In a previous study, we showed that in patients with any percentage lobular component at core needle biopsy, preoperative MRI leads to the detection of clinically relevant additional findings in a substantial percentage of patients, irrespective of the percentage of the lobular component. Detection of a small lobular component may however not be reproducible among pathologists. Loss of membrane expression of E-cadherin or p120 is useful biomarkers of ILC and may therefore support a more objective diagnosis. All patients diagnosed with breast cancer containing a lobular component of any percentage between January 2008 and October 2012 were prospectively offered preoperative MRI. Clinically relevant additional findings on MRI were verified by pathology evaluation. Expression patterns of E-cadherin and p120 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on the core needle biopsy. MRI was performed in 109 patients. The percentage of lobular component was significantly increased in cases with aberrant E-cadherin or p120 expression (both p = &lt;0.001).

However, a thorough understanding of CTCs associated with breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is necessary for early identification and evaluation of treatment response to BCBM. Here we report that BCBM CTCs is enriched in a distinct sub-population of cells identifiable by their biomarker expression and mutational content. Deriving from a comprehensive analysis of CTC transcriptomes, we discovered a unique &quot;circulating tumor cell gene signature&quot; that is distinct from primary breast cancer tissues. Further dissection of the circulating tumor cell gene signature identified signaling pathways associated with BCBM CTCs that may have roles in potentiating BCBM. This study proposes CTC biomarkers and signaling pathways implicated in BCBM that may be used either as a screening tool for brain micro-metastasis detection or for making rational treatment decisions and monitoring therapeutic response in patients with BCBM.Characterization of CTCs derived from breast cancer patients with brain metastasis (BCBM) may allow for early diagnosis of brain metastasis and/or help for treatment choice and its efficacy. In this study, the authors identify a unique signature, based on patient-derived CTCs transcriptomes, for BCBM- CTCs that is different from primary tumors.</AbstractText>\n"

This molecule had been predicted to be drug-like, possessing unique medicinal properties. Despite strides made in chemotherapy, prognosis of the heterogenous aggressive triple negative breast cancer is still poor. This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of inhibition of Artonin E, a prenylated flavonoid on MDA-MB 231 triple negative breast cancer cell, with a view of mitigating the hallmarks displayed by these tumors. The anti-proliferative effect, mode of cell death and the mechanism of apoptosis induction were investigated. Artonin E, was seen to effectively relinquish MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells of their apoptosis evading capacity, causing a half-maximal growth inhibition at low concentrations (14.3, 13.9 and 9.8 μM) after the tested time points (24, 48 and 72 hours), respectively. The mode of cell death was observed to be apoptosis with defined characteristics. Artonin E was seen to induce the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic caspases initiators of apoptosis. It also enhanced the release of total reactive oxygen species which polarized the mitochondrial membrane, compounding the release of cytochrome c. Gene expression studies revealed the upregulation of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand and proapoptotic genes with down regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and proteins. A G2/M cell cycle arrest was also observed and was attributed to the observed upregulation of p21 independent of the p53 status. Interestingly, livin, a new member of the inhibitors of apoptosis was confirmed to be significantly repressed. In all, Artonin E showed the potential as a promising candidate to combat the aggressive triple negative breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Acquisition of a mesenchymal morphology and phenotype in addition to driving migration is a consequential process that promotes metastasis. Although some kinases are known to regulate a mesenchymal phenotype, the role for a substantial portion of the human kinome remains uncharacterized. Here we evaluated the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and screened a panel of TNBC cell lines to evaluate the compounds' effects on a mesenchymal phenotype. Our screen identified 36 hits representative of twelve kinase inhibitor chemotypes based on reversal of the mesenchymal cell morphology, which was then prioritized to twelve compounds based on gene expression and migratory behavior analyses. We selected the most active compound and confirmed mesenchymal reversal on transcript and protein levels with qRT-PCR and Western Blot. Finally, we utilized a kinase array to identify candidate kinases responsible for the EMT reversal. This investigation shows the novel application to identify previously unrecognized kinase pathways and targets in acquisition of a mesenchymal TNBC phenotype that warrant further investigation. Future studies will examine specific roles of the kinases in mechanisms responsible for acquisition of the mesenchymal and/or migratory phenotype.</AbstractText>\n"

In 2015, two large clinical trials led to a paradigm shift in the adjuvant endocrine treatment of premenopausal women, introducing the use of LHRHa plus tamoxifen (or aromatase inhibitor, AI) into current clinical practice. Areas covered: The present review aims to provide an in-depth overview of the role of LHRHa+tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR+BC). Expert opinion: The addition of LHRHa to endocrine treatment (either tamoxifen or AI) is effective in premenopausal women who are at high risk of relapse. To date, no clear recommendations are available for the choice between LHRHa+tamoxifen and LHRH+AI. Although recent data showed better DFS with LHRHa+AI, other issues should be considered: 1) approximately 20 out of 100 women do not reach complete OFS with LHRHa+AI; 2) there is no extended endocrine therapy option that can be applied to women who received 5 years of LHRHa+AI and remained premenopausal at the end of the fifth year. Long-term results of the SOFT-TEXT study are needed to establish if LHRHa+AI is superior to LHRHa+tamoxifen.</AbstractText>\n"

In 2014, worldwide, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), and of these, over 600 million were obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). Although the association between obesity and the risk of diabetes and coronary artery disease is widely known, the impact of obesity on cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality is not fully appreciated. Obesity is associated both with a higher risk of developing breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, and with worse disease outcome for women of all ages. The first part of this review summarizes the relationships between obesity and breast cancer development and outcomes in premenopausal and postmenopausal women and in those with hormone receptor-positive and -negative disease. The second part of this review addresses hypothesized molecular mechanistic insights that may underlie the effects of obesity to increase local and circulating proinflammatory cytokines, promote tumor angiogenesis and stimulate the most malignant cancer stem cell population to drive cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis. Finally, a review of observational studies demonstrates that increased physical activity is associated with lower breast cancer risk and better outcomes. The effects of recent lifestyle interventions to decrease sex steroids, insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway activation, and inflammatory biomarkers associated with worse breast cancer outcomes in obesity also are discussed. Although many observational studies indicate that exercise with weight loss is associated with improved breast cancer outcome, further prospective studies are needed to determine whether weight reduction will lead to improved patient outcomes. It is hoped that several ongoing lifestyle intervention trials, which are reviewed herein, will support the systematic incorporation of weight loss intervention strategies into care for patients with breast cancer.

In the future, it is hoped immune-based biomarkers will predict benefit from anti-HER2 treatments in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. In advanced-stage disease, the quantification of tumour heterogeneity using molecular-imaging technology has generated informative data on the success or failure of the antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1. Treatment tailoring remains a high priority, in cost-constrained health-care systems, but such tailoring will require a dramatic shift in the way translational research is being conducted, with the establishment of large, easily accessible, and well-annotated databases of candidate predictive biomarkers. Single-centre biomarker research should become a thing of the past.</AbstractText>\n"

The imaging modality on which each cancer was seen was noted. Screening strategies were postulated. For each screening strategy, rates of advanced cancer diagnosis, with 95% confidence limits, are calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Differences in outcomes were calculated using Cochrane Q test and McNemar test for paired observations.

Patients and Methods Tumor tissue was collected from 1,003 patients with node-negative, stage I and II breast cancer who were randomly assigned in the Swedish Breast Cancer Group 91 Radiotherapy trial between 1991 and 1997 to breast conservation surgery with or without RT. Systemic adjuvant treatment was sparsely used (8%). Subtyping was performed with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays for 958 tumors. Results RT reduced the cumulative incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) as a first event within 10 years for luminal A-like tumors (19% v 9%; P = .001), luminal B-like tumors (24% v 8%; P &lt; .001), and triple-negative tumors (21% v 6%; P = .08), but not for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (luminal and nonluminal) tumors (15% v 19%; P = .6); however, evidence of an overall difference in RT effect between subtypes was weak ( P = .21). RT reduced the rate of death from breast cancer (BCD) for triple-negative tumors (hazard ratio, 0.35; P = .06), but not for other subtypes. Death from any cause was not improved by RT in any subtype. A hypothesized clinical low-risk group did not have a low risk of IBTR without RT, and RT reduced the rate of IBTR as a first event after 10 years (20% v 6%; P = .008), but had no effect on BCD or death from any cause. Conclusion Subtype was not predictive of response to RT, although, in our study, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors seemed to be most radioresistant, whereas triple-negative tumors had the largest effect on BCD. The effect of RT in the presumed low-risk luminal A-like tumors was excellent.</AbstractText>\n"

As for protein-coding RNAs, epigenetic deregulation of lncRNA expression by alterations in DNA methylation might contribute to carcinogenesis. To provide genome-wide information on lncRNAs aberrantly methylated in breast cancer we profiled tumors of the C3(1) SV40TAg mouse model by MCIp-seq (Methylated CpG Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing). This approach detected 69 lncRNAs differentially methylated between tumor tissue and normal mammary glands, with 26 located in antisense orientation of a protein-coding gene. One of the hypomethylated lncRNAs, 1810019D21Rik (now called Esrp2-antisense (as)) was identified in proximity to the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (Esrp2) that is significantly elevated in C3(1) tumors. ESRPs were shown previously to have a dual role in carcinogenesis. Both gain and loss have been associated with poor prognosis in human cancers, but the mechanisms regulating expression are not known. In-depth analyses indicate that coordinate overexpression of Esrp2 and Esrp2-as inversely correlates with DNA methylation. Luciferase reporter gene assays support co-expression of Esrp2 and the major short Esrp2-as variant from a bidirectional promoter, and transcriptional regulation by methylation of a proximal enhancer. Ultimately, this enhancer-based regulatory mechanism provides a novel explanation for tissue-specific expression differences and upregulation of Esrp2 during carcinogenesis. Knockdown of Esrp2-as reduced Esrp2 protein levels without affecting mRNA expression and resulted in an altered transcriptional profile associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), cell motility and reduced proliferation, whereas overexpression enhanced proliferation. Our findings not only hold true for the murine tumor model, but led to the identification of an unannotated human homolog of Esrp2-as which is significantly upregulated in human breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis.</AbstractText>\n"

We investigated whether this increase was sustained at three years, and the effect on breast screening self-referral. Methods We randomly allocated 867 women attending their final invited breast screening appointment to the Promoting Early Presentation intervention or usual care. We examined breast cancer awareness after three years and breast screening self-referrals after four years. Results Women in the Promoting Early Presentation intervention arm had higher breast cancer awareness at three years than the usual care arm (odds ratio: 10.4; 95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 34.8). There were no differences in proportions self-referring for breast screening between arms, but statistical power was limited.

This study aims at evaluating an in-house developed DIBH system. Free-breathing (FB) and DIBH plans were generated for 22 left-sided localized breast cancer patients who had radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery. All patients were treated utilizing an in-house laser distance measuring system. 50 Gy was prescribed, and parameters of interest were target coverage, left anterior descending coronary artery, (LAD) and heart doses. Portal images were acquired and the reproducibility and stability of DIBH treatment were compared to FB. The comparing result shows there is a significant reduction in all LAD and heart dose statistics for DIBH compared to FB plans without compromising the target coverage. The maximum LAD dose was reduced from 43.7 Gy to 29.0 Gy and the volume of the heart receiving &gt;25 Gy was reduced from 3.3% to 1.0% using the in-house system, both statistically significant. The in-house system gave a reproducible and stable DIBH treatment where the systematic error ∑, and random error σ, were less than 2.2 mm in all directions, but were not significantly better than at FB.

Manual interpretation of HER2 FISH is based on a limited number of cells and rather complex definitions of equivocal, polysomic, and genetically heterogeneous (GH) cases. Image analysis (IA) can extract high-capacity data and potentially improve HER2 testing in borderline cases. We investigated statistically derived indicators of HER2 heterogeneity in HER2 FISH data obtained by automated IA of 50 IHC borderline (2+) cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Overall, IA significantly underestimated the conventional HER2, CEP17 counts, and HER2/CEP17 ratio; however, it collected more amplified cells in some cases below the lower limit of GH definition by manual procedure. Indicators for amplification, polysomy, and bimodality were extracted by factor analysis and allowed clustering of the tumors into amplified, nonamplified, and equivocal/polysomy categories. The bimodality indicator provided independent cell diversity characteristics for all clusters. Tumors classified as bimodal only partially coincided with the conventional GH heterogeneity category. We conclude that automated high-capacity nonselective tumor cell assay can generate evidence-based HER2 intratumor heterogeneity indicators to refine GH definitions.</AbstractText>\n"

Using multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the probability of mammography within the last 12 months by 5- and 10-year life expectancy (using the validated Schonberg index), adjusting for survey year, region, age, marital status, insurance, educational attainment, and indicators of access to care. Results Of 1,040 respondents, 33.7% were age ≥ 80 years and 88.6% were white. Approximately 8.6% and 35.1% had an estimated life expectancy of ≤ 5 and ≤ 10 years, respectively.

In adjusted analyses, lower ( v higher) life expectancy was significantly associated with lower odds of mammography (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8 for ≤ 5-year life expectancy and OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.6 for ≤ 10-year life expectancy). Conclusion Many (57%) older breast cancer survivors with an estimated short life expectancy (&lt; 5 years) receive annual surveillance mammography despite unknown benefits, whereas 14% with estimated life expectancy &gt; 10 years did not report mammography. Practice guidelines are needed to optimize and tailor follow-up care for older patients.</AbstractText>\n"

However, 15-20% of patients have axillary nodal metastasis based on the sentinel LN biopsy. Purpose To assess whether ultrasound (US) features of a primary tumor are associated with axillary LN metastasis in patients with clinical T1-T2N0 breast cancer. Material and Methods This retrospective study included 138 consecutive patients (median age = 51 years; age range = 27-78 years) who underwent breast surgery with axillary LN evaluation for clinically node-negative T1-T2 breast cancer. Three radiologists blinded to the axillary surgery results independently reviewed the US images. Tumor distance from the skin and distance from the nipple were determined based on the US report. Association between US features of a breast tumor and axillary LN metastasis was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model after controlling for clinicopathologic variables. Results Of the 138 patients, 28 (20.3%) had nodal metastasis. At univariate analysis, tumor distance from the skin ( P = 0.019), tumor size on US ( P = 0.023), calcifications ( P = 0.036), architectural distortion ( P = 0.001), and lymphovascular invasion ( P = 0.049) were associated with axillary LN metastasis. At multivariate analysis, shorter skin-to-tumor distance (odds ratio [OR] = 4.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-16.19; P = 0.040) and masses with associated architectural distortion (OR = 3.80; 95% CI = 1.57-9.19; P = 0.003) were independent predictors of axillary LN metastasis. Conclusion US features of breast cancer can be promising factors associated with axillary LN metastasis in patients with clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

A total of 30 BC tissues, 30 corresponding noncancerous tissues, and 10 normal control (NC) breast tissues were obtained to detect the levels of miR-143, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) and mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 7 (MAP3K7) using RT-qPCR, western blotting or immunohistochemistry. The correlation of miR-143 with ERK5 or MAP3K7 was evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with miR-143 mimic, miR-143 inhibitor, miR-143 mimic/inhibitor + si-ERK5, si-MAP3K7 or si-cyclin D1. Then, cell growth was evaluated by MTT assay and the expressions of phospho-ERK5 (p-ERK5), ERK5, p-MAP3K7, MAP3K7 and cyclin D1 were detected by western blotting. Results showed that, compared with noncancerous tissues or NC breast tissues, miR-143 level was decreased, while p-ERK5, ERK5, p-MAP3K7 and MAP3K7 expressions were increased in BC tissues (all P&lt;0.01). The miR-143 level was negatively correlated with the mRNA level of ERK5 or MAP3K7 (r=-4.231 or r=-4.280, P&lt;0.01). In addition, up-regulated miR-143 significantly decreased the expressions of p-ERK5, ERK5, p-MAP3K7, MAP3K7 and cyclin D1 (all P&lt;0.01), as well as cell viability in MCF-7 cells (all P&lt;0.05) while the effect of down-regulated miR-143 was the opposite. In conclusion, both ERK5 and MAP3K7 may be the target genes of miR-143. Increased expression of miR-143 can inhibit cell growth, which may be associated with ERK5 and MAP3K7 expressions in BC.</AbstractText>\n"

Thirty-two post-adjuvant therapy breast cancer survivors (age = 52 ± 10 years; BMI = 27.2 ± 4.4 kg∙m<sup>2</sup>) were randomised to a six-month home-based PA intervention with face-to-face and telephone PA counselling or usual care. Cardiorespiratory fitness and self-reported PA were assessed at baseline and at six-months. Participants had a mean relative V̇O<sub>2</sub>max of 25.3 ± 4.7 ml∙kg<sup>-1</sup>∙min<sup>-1</sup>, which is categorised as &quot;poor&quot; according to age and gender matched normative values. Magnitude-based inference analyses revealed likely at least small beneficial effects (effect sizes ≥.20) on absolute and relative V̇O<sub>2</sub> max (d = .44 and .40, respectively), and total and moderate PA (d = .73 and .59, respectively) in the intervention compared to the usual care group. We found no likely beneficial improvements in any other outcome. Our home-based PA intervention led to likely beneficial, albeit modest, increases in cardiorespiratory fitness and self-reported PA in breast cancer survivors. This intervention has the potential for widespread implementation and adoption, which could considerably impact on post-treatment recovery in this population.</AbstractText>\n"

The aim of this study was to investigate heart position variability in vmDIBH using CBCT and to compare this variability with differences in heart position between vmDIBH and free breathing (FB). For 50 patients initial heart position with respect to the field edge (HP-FE) was measured on a vmDIBH planning CT scan. Breath-hold was monitored using an in-house developed vertical plastic stick. On pre-treatment CBCT scans, heart position variability with respect to the field edge (Δ<sub>HP-FE</sub>) was measured, reflecting heart position variability when using an offline correction protocol. After registering the CBCT scan to the planning CT, heart position variability with respect to the chest wall (Δ<sub>HP-CW</sub>) was measured, reflecting heart position variability when using an online correction protocol. As a control group, vmDIBH and FB computed tomography (CT) scans were acquired for 30 patients and registering both scans on the chest wall. For 34 out of 50 patients, the average HP-FE and HP-CW increased over the treatment course in comparison to the planning CT. Averaged over all patients and all treatment fractions, the Δ<sub>HP-FE</sub> and the Δ<sub>HP-CW</sub> was 0.8±4.2mm (range -9.4-+10.6mm) and 1.0±4.4mm (range -8.3-+10.4mm) respectively. The average gain in heart to chest wall distance was 11.8±4.6mm when using vmDIBH instead of FB.

The rate of brain metastases is 10-30% in patients with advanced breast cancer which is associated with poor prognosis. The potential application of miRNAs in the diagnostics and therapeutics of breast cancer with brain metastasis is an area of intense interest. In an initial effort to systematically address the differential expression of miRNAs and mRNAs in primary breast cancer which may provide clues for early detection of brain metastasis, we analyzed the consequent changes in global patterns of gene expression in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data set obtained by microarray from patients with in situ carcinoma and patients with brain metastasis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"MATERIALS AND METHODS\">The miRNA-pathway regulatory network and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network were investigated in breast cancer specimens from patients with brain metastasis to screen for significantly dysregulated miRNAs followed by prediction of their target genes and pathways by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Functional coordination of the changes of gene expression can be modulated by individual miRNAs. Two miRNAs, hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-16-5p, were identified as having the highest associations with targeted mRNAs [such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), small body size/mothers against decapentaplegic 3 (SMAD3) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)] and pathways associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and other processes linked with cancer metastasis (including cell cycle, adherence junctions and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction). mRNAs for two genes [HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing 1 (HUWE1) and BCL2] were found to have the highest associations with miRNAs, which were down-regulated in brain metastasis specimens of breast cancer. The change of 11 selected miRNAs was verified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset. Up-regulation of hsa-miR-17-5p was detected in triple-negative breast cancer tissues in TCGA. Furthermore, a negative correlation of hsa-miR-17-5p with overall survival and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and BCL2 target genes was found in TCGA breast cancer specimens.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\">Our findings provide a functionally coordinated expression pattern of different families of miRNAs that may have potential to provide clinicians with a strategy to treat breast cancer with brain metastasis from a systems-rather than a single-gene perspective.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

We analyzed factors associated with selection of these treatment modalities in a rural West Virginia tertiary care hospital. We conducted a 10-year analysis of women treated for ESBC at our institution from the institutional cancer registry. Variables were compared between patients choosing BCS versus mastectomy. In women who chose mastectomy, predictors for choice of CPM were also examined. Variables with P &lt; 0.05 on univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to define independent predictors of treatment choice. The mastectomy rate increased from 18.0 per cent in 2006 to 40.2 per cent in 2013. On multivariate analysis, insurance status (P &lt; 0.001), comorbidities (P = 0.001), and surgeon graduation after 1987-a surrogate for surgeon age-(P = 0.010) predicted receipt of mastectomy. Of those receiving mastectomy, 106 (25.1%) elected CPM. CPM rates increased from 8.0 per cent in 2006 to 45.0 per cent in 2013. Younger age at diagnosis (P &lt; 0.001) and use of preoperative MRI (P = 0.012) independently predicted use of CPM versus unilateral mastectomy. Rates of mastectomy and CPM in ESBC have increased in West Virginia over time. Independent predictors of selecting mastectomy over BCS included insurance status, surgeon age, and associated comorbidities. Younger patients and patients receiving preoperative MRI were more likely to choose CPM. Awareness of these factors will aid in counseling women with ESBC and allow clinicians to address potential biases or disparities that may affect treatment choices.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The low-grade luminal breast cancer was defined as hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative with nuclear grades 1 or 2. The patterns of tumor shrinkage as revealed at MR imaging were categorized into two types: concentric shrinkage (CS) and non-CS. Among 854 patients who had received NAC in a single institution from January 2000 to December 2009, 183 patients with low-grade luminal breast cancer were retrospectively evaluated for the development set. Another data set from 292 patients who had received NAC in the same institution between January 2010 and December 2012 was used for the validation set. Among these 292 patients, 121 patients with low-grade luminal breast cancer were retrospectively evaluated. Results In the development set, the median observation period was 67.9 months. Recurrence was observed in 31 patients, and 16 deaths were related to breast cancer. There were statistically significant differences in both the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates between patterns of tumor shrinkage (P &lt; .001 and P &lt; .001, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the CS pattern had the only significant independent association with DFS (P = .001) and OS (P = .009) rate. In the validation set, the median follow-up period was 56.9 months. Recurrence was observed in 20 patients (16.5%) and eight (6.6%) deaths were related to breast cancer. DFS rate was significantly longer in patients with the CS pattern (72.8 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 69.9, 75.6 months) than in those with the non-CS pattern (56.0 months; 95% CI: 49.1, 62.9 months; P ≤ .001). The CS pattern was associated with an excellent prognosis (median OS, 80.6 months; 95% CI: 79.3, 81.8 months vs 65.0 months; 95% CI: 60.1, 69.8 months; P = .004). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the CS pattern had the only significant independent association with DFS (P = .007) and OS (P = .037) rates. Conclusion The CS pattern as revealed at MR imaging during NAC had the only significant independent association with prognosis in patients with low-grade luminal breast cancer. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017.</AbstractText>\n"

Given the correlation between obesity and relative risk of death from cancer, we investigated whether obesity-associated inflammation promotes metastatic progression. We demonstrate that obesity causes lung neutrophilia in otherwise normal mice, which is further exacerbated by the presence of a primary tumour. The increase in lung neutrophils translates to increased breast cancer metastasis to this site, in a GM-CSF- and IL5-dependent manner. Importantly, weight loss is sufficient to reverse this effect, and reduce serum levels of GM-CSF and IL5 in both mouse models and humans. Our data indicate that special consideration of the obese patient population is critical for effective management of cancer progression.</AbstractText>\n"

Here, we investigated a potential involvement of GLCE polymorphism(s) in breast cancer development in Siberian women population. Comprehensive analysis of SNP databases revealed GLCE rs3865014 (Val597Ile) missense polymorphism as the main significantly present in human populations. According the TaqMan-based SNP assay, allele distributions for the rs3865014 (A&gt;G) were similar in healthy Siberian women (n=136) and cancer patients (n=129) (A0,73:G0,27) and intermediate between the European and Asian populations, while genotype distributions were different, with the increase of AG rate in breast cancer patients (OR=1.76; 95% CI=1.04-1.90; P(Y)=0.035 χ<sup>2</sup>=4.44). Heterozygous AG genotype was associated with tumour size (OR=3.67, P(Y)=0.004), ER-negative tumours (OR=3.25, P(Y)=0.0028), triple-negative tumours (OR=4.94, P(Y)=0.015) but not menopausal status, PR and HER-2 status, local or distant metastasis. Homozygous GLCE genotypes (AA/GG) were more common for ER+PR+ luminal A breast cancer (OR=0.25, P(Y)=0.031). Loss-of-heterozigosity was identified in 5 of 51 breast tumours and the loss of G allele was associated with the decreased GLCE expression. Epidemiologic data for the GLCE SNP in different racial/ethnic groups demonstrated high AG genotype rates as a risk factor not for breast cancer incidence but for poor prognosis of the disease. The obtained data suggest an involvement of GLCE rs3865014 in breast cancer development. Heterozygous AG genotype might be a risk factor for breast cancer susceptibility in Siberian women and is associated with aggressive ER-negative and triple-negative cancer subtypes.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This diagnosis also occurs at a later stage in the disease. Early detection along with proper treatment reduces radical mastectomy and mortality rates, yet only one-third of Arab women in Qatar participate in breast cancer screening (BCS) activities of any sort. Many women in the conservative Qatari society rely on male family members for support and protection. This study investigates the attitudes and perceptions of Arab men in regards to breast cancer screening and what they see as both incentives and barriers to women's participation in BCS activities.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"DESIGN\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">A qualitative methodology using purposive sampling technique was chosen in order to explore participant's attitudes, beliefs and health-related actions. Individual in-depth interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with 50 Arab men during October 2011 to May 2012. Data collection, analysis, and interpretation occurred simultaneously. NVivo 9, a qualitative data analysis software program was used to organize themes and subthemes.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">It was found that most men understood the importance of regular BCS in early detection of breast cancer. They felt they had an important role in encouraging the women in their lives to participate in BCS activities, but were adamant that any examination must be done by a female health care professional. Few knew details about screening guidelines in Qatar, but most had a basic knowledge of some screening activities. Most indicated an interest in learning more about BC and screening activities in order to better help and inform their female family members.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Because Arab men perceive that their opinions and support are a major factor influencing female family members' participation in breast cancer screening, it is important that any program instituted to increase such screening participation be aimed at both men and women. More information is needed by both sexes as to the need for and benefits of regular screening activities, the techniques used, and the newly revised guidelines in Qatar. Such a program needs to be introduced in the near future in order to avert, at least partially, the expected doubling in breast cancer cases by 2030 in the Middle East.</AbstractText>\n"

As the US population continues to age, oncologists will increasingly encounter this clinical challenge. Several strategies involving each core component of breast cancer therapy have been investigated to minimize treatment in these patients while still maintaining acceptable outcomes. These include omission of primary tumor resection, surgical axillary evaluation, systemic chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy, as well as reduction in radiotherapy treatment volume (partial breast irradiation) or total treatment time (hypofractionation). We review these strategies and the literature supporting their use, as well as future directions for treatment minimization.</AbstractText>\n"

The BOLERO-2 trial showed that everolimus-exemestane achieves increased progression free survival (PFS) compared with exemestane. However, there is great inter-patient variability in toxicity and response to exemestane-everolimus treatment. The objective of this study was to perform an exploratory study analyzing the implication of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on outcomes from this treatment through a pharmacogenetic analysis.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"PATIENTS AND METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Blood was collected from 90 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC treated with exemestane-everolimus following progression after prior treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Everolimus pharmacokinetics was measured in 37 patients. Twelve SNPs in genes involved in everolimus pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were genotyped and associations assessed with drug plasma levels, clinically relevant toxicities (non-infectious pneumonitis, mucositis, hyperglycemia and hematological toxicities), dose reductions or treatment suspensions due to toxicity, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">We found that CYP3A4 rs35599367 variant (CYP3A4*22 allele) carriers had higher everolimus blood concentration compared to wild type patients (P = 0.019).

"28727517","2017/07/21 06:00","Comparative Toxicity and Effectiveness of Trastuzumab-Based Chemotherapy Regimens in Older Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer.","<AbstractText>Purpose The combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab is the standard of care for adjuvant treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. Two regimens have been widely adopted in the United States: doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab (ACTH) and docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH). No head-to-head comparison of these regimens has been conducted in a clinical trial, and existing trial data have limited generalizability to older patients. Methods We used SEER-Medicare data from 2005 to 2013 to compare outcomes of ACTH versus TCH among patients age older than 65 years. Propensity score matching was used to balance cohort characteristics between treatment arms. Outcomes included toxicity-related hospitalization, survival, and trastuzumab completion. Data from 1,077 patients receiving ACTH or TCH were analyzed, and the propensity-matched subsample included 416 women. Results There was a significant shift toward TCH over time, with 88% of patients receiving ACTH in 2005 compared with 15% by 2011. Among propensity score-matched patients, we found no difference between regimens in health care use overall or for chemotherapy-related adverse events (ACTH, 34% v TCH, 36.5%; P = .46). Patients receiving TCH were significantly more likely to complete trastuzumab (89% v 77%; P = .001). There was no difference in 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (ACTH, 92% v TCH, 96%; hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.90 to 4.82) or overall survival. Conclusion Among a matched sample of older patients, ACTH compared with TCH was not associated with a higher rate of serious adverse events or hospitalizations, but it was associated with less completion of adjuvant trastuzumab. We did not detect a difference in 5-year survival outcomes for ACTH compared with TCH. In the context of limited evidence in older patients, selection between these two regimens on the basis of concerns about differential toxicity or efficacy may not be appropriate.</AbstractText>\n"

Data were extracted from the medical records of consecutive patients treated between 2014 and 2015 in two centers. Extracted data included patient's demographics, treatment, referral to psychological supportive care programs, and prescribed psychotropic drugs. Data from the two centers were compared using Student's t, Wilcoxon, Fisher's exact, and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests. Adjusted relative risks (RR) were estimated using Poisson regression. A total of 231 (Italy = 110, USA = 121) patients were included, with a mean age of 60 years. The crude rate of psychological supportive care visits was similar in the US versus the Italian cohort (28.9 vs. 21.8%, p = 0.23). The crude rate of prescribed psychotropic drug was higher in the US cohort versus Italian cohort (43.8 vs. 18.2%, p &lt; 0.0001). These differences remained significant after adjusting for breast cancer subtype, stage, and treatment (RR 1.8, 95 CI 1.17-2.76). Between 20 and 30% of patients receive psychological supportive care during treatment for breast cancer. The use of psychotropic medication was higher in the US cohort than the cohort from Italy. The reasons for these differences might be related to social and cultural differences and the method of prescribing medication.</AbstractText>\n"

Here we provide functional evidence that LOXL2 is a key driver of breast cancer metastasis in two conditional transgenic mouse models of PyMT-induced breast cancer. LOXL2 ablation in mammary tumor cells dramatically decreased lung metastasis, whereas LOXL2 overexpression promoted metastatic tumor growth. LOXL2 depletion or overexpression in tumor cells does not affect extracellular matrix stiffness or organization in primary and metastatic tumors, implying a function for LOXL2 independent of its conventional role in extracellular matrix remodeling. In support of this likelihood, cellular and molecular analyses revealed an association of LOXL2 action with elevated levels of the EMT regulatory transcription factor Snail1 and expression of several cytokines that promote premetastatic niche formation.

Our primary data showed that PPFIA1 expression was significantly higher in liver metastatic breast tumors than in the primary tumors. Then, we tried to pool previous annotated genomic data to assess the prognostic value of PPFIA1 in distant metastasis-free survival, the risk of metastatic relapse, and metastatic relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients by data mining in two large databases, Kaplan-Meier plotter and bc-GenExMiner 4.0. Results from Kaplan-Meier plotter showed that although high PPFIA1 expression was generally associated with decreased distant metastasis-free survival in estrogen receptor+ patients, subgroup analysis only confirmed significant association in estrogen receptor+/N- (nodal negative) group (median survival, high PPFIA1 group vs low PPFIA1 cohort: 191.21 vs 236.22 months; hazard ratio: 2.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.42-3.5, p &lt; 0.001), but not in estrogen receptor+/N+ (nodal positive) group (hazard ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.88-3.03, p = 0.12).

The detection of novel specific BC serum indicators for screening purposes is an essential clinical need. A total of 437 serum specimens from 310 BC patients that were divided into mining and testing sets were collected in this study. In contrast with the conventional BC indicators through receiver operating characteristic, survival and hazard function curves, and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we intended to hunt for stable protein indicators from serum specimens and identify their diagnostic and prognostic potential for BC. We identified a unique serum peptide located at 6648 Da originated from apoC-III with a validated correlation with BC tumorigenesis with confirmation in a substantive testing set and minimization of systematic bias by pre-analytical parameters. We found that the diagnostic efficacy of this peptide is better than the present conventional BC diagnostic indicators either alone or in combination with conventional indicators in distinguishing BC patients from control volunteers. Moreover, this peptide denotes a stronger prognostic factor for BC patients than conventional indicators. In light of these findings, we speculate that this peptide is a potential diagnostic and prognostic indicator and a supplement to conventional indicators in monitoring BC. The detection of this peptide located at 6648 Da in sera could enhance early screening and assessment of the postoperative survival opportunity for BC patients.</AbstractText>\n"

We computed descriptive statistics for all the variable of interest. Factors testing significant in univariate analysis were included in multivariate models. Survival data were compared by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. The median follow-up was 45 months. We observed 60 (28.2%) pathological complete response (pCR). The sequential anthracyclines-taxanes-based regimens produced the highest rate of pCR (42.6%), followed by concomitant anthracycline-taxane (24.2%), and other regimens (15.6%) (p = 0.008). When analyzing the role of baseline Ki-67, a 50% cut-off was the optimal threshold value for pCR prediction (p = 0.0005). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 57.3% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 70.8%. In patients not achieving pCR, the optimal Ki-67 variation between biopsy and surgical specimen with prognostic relevance on long-term outcomes was 13% (p = 0.04). Patients with a Ki-67 reduction (rKi-67)&lt;13% had worse outcomes compared to those who experienced pCR or a rKi-67≥13%. The number of NACT cycles also affected long-term outcomes (5-year DFS 65.7% vs 51.6% in patients having received &gt;6 cycles compared with their counterparts, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, node status, grading, and bio-pathological treatment response (including pCR and rKi-67) impacted DFS and OS. Our results confirmed the advantage conferred by more than 6 cycles of a sequential antracycline-taxane-based NACT. Higher baseline Ki-67 values shows greater predictive significance on pathogical response, while the rKi-67 plays a prognostic role on long-term outcomes.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

The present study aimed to assess the overall satisfaction of Danish citizens with their breast cancer screening experiences, as well as their level of discomfort, concerns, and feelings of obligation to participate. Furthermore, we analyzed the associations between overall satisfaction and the remaining outcomes.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">Questionnaires were mailed to 3000 women in the Central Denmark Region who received screening examination results in the fall of 2013. The questionnaire assessed satisfaction (overall, telephone hot-line, and web-based self-service), discomfort (pain and boundaries of modesty), concerns (at invitation, while waiting for results, and after receiving results), and feelings of obligation to participate. Background information was retrieved from Statistics Denmark. Pearson's chi-square test was used to test differences in outcomes and demographic characteristic distributions between respondents and non-respondents and highly satisfied vs. less satisfied participants.

Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, 10 quantitative imaging features depicting tumor-adjacent parenchymal enhancement patterns were extracted and screened for prognostic features in a discovery cohort of 60 patients. By using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a radiogenomic map for the tumor-adjacent parenchymal tissue was created and molecular pathways associated with prognostic parenchymal imaging features were identified. Furthermore, a multigene signature of the parenchymal imaging feature was built in a training cohort (n = 126), and its prognostic relevance was evaluated in two independent cohorts (n = 879 and 159). Results One image feature measuring heterogeneity (ie, information measure of correlation) was significantly associated with prognosis (false-discovery rate &lt; 0.1), and at a cutoff of 0.57 stratified patients into two groups with different recurrence-free survival rates (log-rank P = .024). The tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway was identified as the top enriched pathway (hypergeometric P &lt; .0001) among genes associated with the image feature. A 73-gene signature based on the tumor profiles in TCGA achieved good association with the tumor-adjacent parenchymal image feature (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.873), which stratified patients into groups regarding recurrence-free survival (log-rank P = .029) and overall survival (log-rank P = .042) in an independent TCGA cohort. The prognostic value was confirmed in another independent cohort (Gene Expression Omnibus GSE 1456), with log-rank P = .00058 for recurrence-free survival and log-rank P = .0026 for overall survival. Conclusion Heterogeneous enhancement patterns of tumor-adjacent parenchyma at MR imaging are associated with the tumor necrosis signaling pathway and poor survival in breast cancer. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.</AbstractText>\n"

However, only a few studies have investigated the link between these risk factors and the pattern of methylation signatures in the breast tissue of healthy women. The role of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene hypermethylation is reportedly important in the development of breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to correlate Oncotype DX® risk groupings with traditional histopathological parameters and the results of other risk assessment tools including Recurrence Score-Pathology-Clinical (RSPC), Adjuvant Risk Index (Adj RI), Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) and the Adjuvant! Online 10-year score (AO). Patients were retrospectively identified from the histopathology databases of two Irish hospitals and patient and tumour characteristics collated. Associations between categorical variables were evaluated with Pearson's chi-square test. Correlations were calculated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and concordance using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 22.0.In our 300 patient cohort, Oncotype DX® classified 59.7% (n = 179) as low, 30% (n = 90) as intermediate, and 10.3% (n = 31) as high risk. Overall concordance between the RS and RSPC, Adj RI, NPI, and AO was 67.3% (n = 202), 56.3% (n = 169), 59% (n = 177), and 36.3% (n = 109), respectively. All risk assessment tools classified the majority of patients as low risk apart from the AO 10-year score, with RSPC classifying the highest number of patients as low risk. This study demonstrates that there is good correlation between the RS and scores obtained using alternative risk tools. Concordance with NPI is strong, particularly in the low-risk group. NPI, calculated from traditional clinicopathological characteristics, is a reliable alternative to Oncotype DX® in the identification of low-risk patients who may avoid adjuvant chemotherapy.</AbstractText>\n"

However, to our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated the use of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept as a single agent in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> We executed this retrospective pilot study to assess the ability of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept to identify sentinel nodes as a single agent in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients. Patients received a single intradermal injection overlying the tumor of either 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept on the day of surgery or 74.0 MBq (2.0 mCi) on the day before surgery by a radiologist. Immediate 3-view lymphoscintigraphy was performed. Intraoperatively, SLNs were identified with a portable γ-probe. A node was classified as hot if the count (per second) of the node was more than 3 times the background count. Descriptive statistics are reported. <b>Results:</b> Nineteen patients underwent SLN biopsy with single-agent <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept. Immediate lymphoscintigraphy identified at least 1 sentinel node in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%). Intraoperatively, at least 1 (mean, 1.7 ± 0.8; range, 1-3) hot node was identified in all patients. Three patients (15.8%) had 1 disease-positive SLN. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this small, retrospective pilot study, <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept performed well as a single agent for intraoperative sentinel node identification in breast cancer. A larger, randomized clinical trial is warranted to compare <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept as a single agent with other radiopharmaceuticals for sentinel node identification in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

In order to improve their physiological stability and antitumour activity for medical application, K2Na[AsIIIMo6O21(O2CCH2NH3)3]·6H2O doped silica nanospheres (POM@SiO2) with diameters of ~40 nm have been synthesized by the water-in-oil microemulsion method in this study. The obtained spheres were morphologically uniform nanosized and nearly monodispersed in solution. The nanoparticles had high entrapment efficiency, which was upto 46.2% by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis and POMs slowly released from the nanospheres both in the PH 7.4 and 5.5 phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solutions in 60 h. The in vitro MTT assays of particles on MCF-7 cell line (a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line) exhibited enhanced antitumor activity compared to that of plain polyoxometalate. The IC50 value of the POM@SiO2 nanoparticles was 40.0 μg/mL at 24 h calculated by the encapsulated POM concentration, which was much lower comparing to that of 2.0 × 104 μg/mL according to the pure POM. And the SiO2 shells showed low inhibitory effect at the corresponding concentration. Confocal images further indicated the cell morphology changes and necrosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed nanoparticles induced the apoptosis by arresting the cells in S phase and western blot analysis indicated they promoted apoptosis by inhibiting the Bcl-2 protein. Moreover, the study of interactions between human serum albumin (HSA) and the nanoparticles indicated the fluorescence quenching was static, and the nanoparticles were likely to bind to HSA and changed its conformation.</AbstractText>\n"

A cohort of 100 primary invasive carcinomas (IC) associated with carcinoma in situ (CIS) were evaluated for HER2 gene amplification by SISH according to the 2013 ASCO/CAP HER2 guideline. A second cohort of all the cases with HER2-GH since the introduction of the updated ASCO/CAP HER2 guideline was also characterized, and an evaluation of the HER2 gene amplification in the CIS component, if present, was also done. In the first cohort, the HER2 amplification in the IC was negative in 87% of the cases and positive in 13% of the cases, without the presence of HER2-GH. All the cases had an associated CIS with the same HER2 status as IC, with four cases of CIS presenting HER2-GH. In the CIS, we observed a significant relationship of HER2 gene amplification with high nuclear grade. In the four cases with HER2-GH in CIS, two cases presented HER2 gene amplification in the IC. The second cohort included 12 cases with HER2-GH in a total of 1243 IC cases (0.97%). Additionally, we identified two cases associated with non-amplified CIS. HER2-GH is a rare event in IC and can already be present in CIS, not being an important step in the acquisition of invasive features.</AbstractText>\n"

Doxorubicin (DOX) is recognized by Pgp and therefore it can induce therapy resistance in breast cancer patients. In this study our aim was to evaluate the susceptibility of the pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (PLD/Doxil®/Caelyx®) to MDR. We show that cells selected to be resistant to DOX are cross-resistant to PLD and PLD is also ineffective in an allograft model of doxorubicin-resistant mouse B-cell leukemia. In contrast, PLD was far more efficient than DOX as reflected by a significant increase of both relapse-free and overall survival of Brca1<sup>-/-</sup>;p53<sup>-/-</sup> mammary tumor bearing mice. Increased survival could be explained by the delayed onset of drug resistance. Consistent with the higher Pgp levels needed to confer resistance, PLD administration was able to overcome doxorubicin insensitivity of the mouse mammary tumors. Our results indicate that the favorable pharmacokinetics achieved with PLD can effectively overcome Pgp-mediated resistance, suggesting that PLD therapy could be a promising strategy for the treatment of therapy-resistant breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"28696856","2017/07/12 06:00","Internal Thoracic Lymphadenopathy in Breast Cancer.","<AbstractText>The internal thoracic (IT) nodal basin is a first-echelon drainage pathway in the breast, accounting for up to a quarter of its lymphatic drainage, primarily from the deep structures of the breast. The presence of internal thoracic node (ITN) metastases upstages the breast cancer (BC) patient to a minimum of clinical stage III disease. Medial tumors, deep tumors, young age, axillary nodal metastases, tumors of a high nuclear grade, lymphovascular invasion, and triple-negative hormone receptor status are predisposing factors for ITN metastases from primary BC. It has been observed that medial tumors carry a worse prognosis than lateral tumors when all other factors are equal, indicating that understaging of ITN has a significant impact on patient outcomes. Despite the established prognostic significance of IT adenopathy in BC, this nodal basin is not routinely staged due to the difficulty in accessing it and due to the controversy regarding its management. Since the initial ITN studies in the 1960s, improvement in imaging techniques and the availability of minimally invasive biopsy techniques have fueled renewed interest in ITNs and their clinical significance in BC. Radiologists who image and diagnose BC can offer more accurate staging assessments by consistently evaluating the IT nodal chain in the BC patient. In this article, the authors discuss current knowledge of the ITNs in BC and review ITN anatomy. The imaging appearance of pathologic ITNs using various modalities, potential mimics of IT adenopathy, and image-guided sampling techniques are described. A succinct discussion of the clinical management of ITN-positive BC and its challenges is also included. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017.</AbstractText>\n"

MYC regulates expression of RNA, both protein and non-coding, that control central metabolic pathways, cell death, proliferation, differentiation, stress pathways, and mechanisms of drug resistance. Activation of MYC has been widely reported in breast cancer progression. Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease and treatment options are primarily guided by histological and biochemical evaluations of the tumors. Based on biochemical markers, three main breast cancer categories are ER+ (estrogen receptor alpha positive), HER2+ (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive), and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer; estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 negative). MYC is elevated in TNBC compared with other cancer subtypes. Interestingly, MYC-driven pathways are further elevated in aggressive breast cancer cells and tumors that display drug resistant phenotype. Identification of MYC target genes is essential in isolating signaling pathways that drive tumor development. In this review, we address the role of MYC in the three major breast cancer subtypes and highlight the most promising leads to target MYC functions.</AbstractText>\n"

"28693914","2017/07/12 06:00","Targeting progesterone metabolism in breast cancer with l-proline derived new 14-azasteroids.","<AbstractText>Breast cancer cell proliferation is promoted by a variety of mitogenic signals. Classically estrogen is considered as most predominant mitogenic signal in hormone-dependent breast cancer and progesterone is primarily considered to have protective effect. However, it is suggested that some progesterone metabolite may promote breast cancer and progesterone metabolites like 5α-pregnane and 4-pregnene could serve as regulators of estrogen-responsiveness of breast cancer cells. Here, we estimated the potential of alternate targeting of breast cancer via progesterone signalling. l-Proline derived novel 14-azasteroid compounds were screened against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines using MTT assay. In silico studies, cell cycle, Annexin-V-FITC/PI, JC-1 mitochondrial assay, ROS analysis were performed to analyse the impact of hit compound 3b on breast cancer cells. Further, we analysed the impact of hit 3b on the progesterone, its metabolites and enzymes responsible for the conversion of progesterone and its metabolites using ELISA. Data suggests that compound 3b binds and down regulates of 5α-reductase by specifically inhibiting production of progesterone metabolites that are capable of promoting breast cancer proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition and migration. This study establishes the proof of concept and generation of new leads for additional targeting of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In breast cancer, malignant cells educate host macrophages to adopt a protumorigenic phenotype. In this study, we show how the integrin-regulatory protein kindlin-2 (FERMT2) promotes metastatic progression of breast cancer through the recruitment and subversion of host macrophages. Kindlin-2 expression was elevated in breast cancer biopsy tissues where its levels correlated with reduced patient survival. On the basis of these observations, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to ablate Kindlin-2 expression in human MDA-MB-231 and murine 4T1 breast cancer cells. Kindlin-2 deficiency inhibited invasive and migratory properties <i>in vitro</i> without affecting proliferation rates. However, <i>in vivo</i> tumor outgrowth was inhibited by &gt;80% in a manner associated with reduced macrophage infiltration and secretion of the macrophage attractant and growth factor colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). The observed loss of CSF-1 appeared to be caused by a more proximal deficiency in TGFβ-dependent signaling in Kindlin-2-deficient cells. Collectively, our results illuminate a Kindlin-2/TGFβ/CSF-1 signaling axis employed by breast cancer cells to capture host macrophage functions that drive tumor progression. <i>Cancer Res; 77(18); 5129-41. ©2017 AACR</i>.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Targeting quality improvement at QMs that demonstrate substantial variation has the potential to make the largest impact at the population level. We developed an approach that uses both variation in performance and number of patients affected by the QM to set priorities for improving the quality of systemic therapy for women with early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Patients and Methods Patients with EBC diagnosed from 2006 to 2010 in Ontario, Canada, were identified in the Ontario Cancer Registry and linked deterministically to multiple health care databases. Individual QMs within a panel of 15 QMs previously developed to assess the quality of systemic therapy across four domains (access, treatment delivery, toxicity, and safety) were ranked on interinstitutional variation in performance (using interquartile range) and the number of patients who were affected; then the two rankings were averaged for a summative priority ranking. Results We identified 28,427 patients with EBC who were treated at 84 institutions. The use of computerized physician electronic order entry for chemotherapy, emergency room visits or hospitalizations during chemotherapy, and timely receipt of chemotherapy were identified as the QMs that had the largest potential to improve quality of care at a system level within this cohort. Conclusion A simple ranking system based on interinstitutional variation in performance and patient volume can be used to identify high-priority areas for quality improvement from a population perspective. This approach is generalizable to other health care systems that use QMs to drive improvement.</AbstractText>\n"

A population based cohort, the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, was used and linked with the Swedish cancer registry up to 31 December 2013. Our study included 1,186 women with breast cancer and an equal number of controls. Selenium levels were analysed from stored serum samples. The included individuals were divided into quartiles based on Se value and we compared breast cancer cases with controls using logistic regression yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Serum Se was also analysed as a continuous variable regarding breast cancer risk. The analyses were adjusted for established risk factors and stratified on smoking status and body mass index (BMI). When comparing the highest Se quartile with the lowest, the adjusted OR for breast cancer was 0.98 (0.75-1.26). With selenium as a continuous variable the adjusted OR was 1.00 (1.00-1.01) per 10 ng/ml. When comparing the highest with the lowest Se quartile in women with BMI &gt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> the adjusted OR was 0.77 (0.53-1.14).

After exhaustion of standard treatments, she underwent experimental treatments and whole-exome sequencing of tumor, blood, and a metastasis. Well-tolerated experimental bortezomib monotherapy was administered for a progression-free period of 11 mo. After progression, treatments were changed and the exome data were evaluated, expanded with RNA and exome sequencing of a late-stage metastasis. In the final stage, eribulin alone and in combination with anthracyclines were administered. While suffering from grade 3 adverse events, skin metastases progressed. She lived 51 mo after initial diagnosis.Toxicity from anthracyclines and cisplatin may have been due to associated germline variants <i>CBR3</i> C4Y and V224M and <i>GSTP1</i> I105V, respectively. Somatic mutations predicted or reported as pathogenic were detected in 38 genes in tumor tissues. All tumor samples harbored the heterozygous <i>TP53</i> Y220C variant, known to destabilize p53 and down-regulate p53-mediated apoptosis. The success of bortezomib may be explained by the previously reported up-regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which is p53-independent. Phylogenetic analysis of blood, primary tumor, and two metastases inferred an ancestral tumor cell with 12 expressed tumor mutations from which all three tumors may have evolved.Although our first urgent analysis could only include 40 genes, postmortem analysis uncovered the aggressiveness and suggested experimental therapies including 16 actionable targets, partly validated by immunohistochemistry.

We developed a quantitative alkylation DNA damage assay based on immunofluorescence and confocal imaging revealing higher levels of alkylation damage in association with epigenetic inactivation of the ALKBH3 gene (P = 0.029). In our cohort of 265 primary breast cancer, we found 72 cases showing aberrantly high CpG promoter methylation over the ALKBH3 promoter (27%; 72 out of 265). We further show that increasingly higher degree of ALKBH3 promoter methylation is associated with reduced breast-cancer specific survival times in patients. In this analysis, ALKBH3 promoter methylation at &gt;20% CpG methylation was found to be statistically significantly associated with reduced survival (HR = 2.3; P = 0.012). By thresholding at the clinically relevant CpG methylation level (&gt;20%), we find the incidence of ALKBH3 promoter methylation to be 5% (13 out of 265).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">ALKBH3 is a novel addition to the catalogue of DNA repair genes found inactivated in breast cancer.

The role and possible mechanisms exerted by cantharidin in cell growth and metastasis of breast cancer were investigated in this study. Cantharidin was found to inhibit cell viability and clonogenic potential in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that cell percentage in G2/M phase decreased, whereas cells in S and G1 phases progressively accumulated with the increasing doses of cantharidin treatment. In a xenograft model of breast cancer, cantharidin inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, high doses of cantharidin treatment inhibited cell migration in wound and healing assay and downregulated protein levels of major matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion were dose-dependently inhibited by cantharidin treatment. Interestingly, the members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling family were less phosphorylated as the cantharidin dose increased. Cantharidin was hypothesized to exert its anticancer effect through the MAPK signaling pathway. The data of this study also highlighted the possibility of using PP2A as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.</AbstractText>\n"

Three-quarters of breast cancers express estrogen and/or progesterone receptors and are considered endocrine-sensitive. Endocrine therapy reduces the risk of loco-regional, contralateral and distant recurrence. The management has become more complex with estrogen receptor inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors and ovarian function suppression. The choice of the regimen and its duration depend on the age, the menopausal status of the patient, her co-morbidities, the risk of cancer relapse and the tolerance. We summarize here the recent modifications of the endocrine therapy in early and advanced stage breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Eigentumors were computed from the images of 563 patients from the MARGINS study. Subsequently, a least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) selected candidates from the components that contained 90% of the variance of the data. The model for prediction of survival after treatment (median follow-up time 86 months) was based on logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values were computed as measures of training and cross-validated performances. The discriminating potential of the model was confirmed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests. From the 322 principal components that explained 90% of the variance of the data, the LASSO selected 28 components. The ROC curves of the model yielded AUC values of 0.88, 0.77 and 0.73, for the training, leave-one-out cross-validated and bootstrapped performances, respectively. The bootstrapped Kaplan-Meier survival curves confirmed significant separation for all tumors (P  &lt;  0.0001). Survival analysis on immunohistochemical subgroups shows significant separation for the estrogen-receptor subtype tumors (P  &lt;  0.0001) and the triple-negative subtype tumors (P  =  0.0039), but not for tumors of the HER2 subtype (P  =  0.41).

This was a descriptive cross-sectional study with 98 women survivors of breast cancer, who were registered with the SIMMON (Integrated Synergies to Improve Oncological Management in Colombia) Foundation. Body weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Body composition (percentage of fat and muscle mass) was evaluated via four-pole bioelectrical impedance analysis. Sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass plus low grip strength or low gait speed (European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria). A &quot;causal&quot; mediation analysis with the Baron &amp;amp; Kenny procedure (PROCESS<sup>®</sup> macro, Columbus, OH, USA) was used to explore variables related to sarcopenia. Analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS 21 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The significance level of the results obtained in the hypothesis contrast was <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. The mean age of the sample was 65.5 ± 5.9 years, with a BMI of 27.8 ± 4.7 kg/m². The prevalence of sarcopenia was 22.4%. Linear regression models suggest a partial mediation of anthropometric parameters (body mass, body mass index and waist circumference) in the association between handgrip strength and muscle mass. In conclusion, one in every five women survivors of breast cancer had sarcopenia. The findings seem to emphasize the importance of obesity prevention in women survivors of breast cancer, suggesting that high handgrip strength may not relate closely to greater muscle mass and therefore would not exclude the risk of sarcopenia.</AbstractText>\n"

The aim was to identify a patient subgroup with a different clinical outcome, which could then be directed towards new targeted therapies. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was carried out using the immunohistochemical score from tissue microarray sections of an initial cohort of 183 (88 sporadic and 95 familial) patients with invasive BC. For the survival analysis, only those patients with complete follow-up were considered. The HCA revealed a 16-protein immunoprofile, nine of which represent the core, as was also found when familial and sporadic BCs were analysed individually. The 16-biomarker immunoprofile was able to identify a group of patients (Group 1) with a more aggressive tumour phenotype. Survival analyses showed that VEGF<sup>+</sup> /TWIST1<sup>-</sup> patients with familial BC of Group 1 tended to demonstrate a lower DFS than the VEGF<sup>-</sup> /TWIST1<sup>+</sup> sporadic BC patients of Group 2 (p = 0.052). Moreover, the entire cohort of VEGF<sup>+</sup> /TWIST1<sup>-</sup> patients showed a statistically worse DFS than the patients with VEGF<sup>-</sup> /TWIST1<sup>+</sup> expression (p = 0.034). In conclusion, we found that tumour stratification based on an immunoprofile is useful to predict the patient clinical behaviour. In particular, our study indicates that the clustering of tumors on the basis of this immunoprofile suggests the possibility to differentiate familial from sporadic BCs and to clinically select those patients who are more likely to benefit from inhibition of the VEGF pathway.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Although the number of projects within supportive cancer care evaluating mobile health is increasing, few evidence-based interventions are described in the literature and thus there is a need for good quality clinical studies with a randomised design and sufficient power to guide future implementations. An interactive information and communications technology platform, including a smartphone/computer tablet app for reporting symptoms during cancer treatment was created in collaboration with a company specialising in health care management. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effects of using the platform for patients with breast cancer during neo adjuvant chemotherapy treatment and patients with locally advanced prostate cancer during curative radiotherapy treatment. The main hypothesis is that the use of the platform will improve clinical management, reduce costs, and promote safe and participatory care.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHOD\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">The study is a prospective, randomised, controlled trial for each patient group and it is based on repeated measurements.

The intervention groups report symptoms via the app daily, during treatment and up to three weeks after end of treatment, as a complement to standard care. Patients in the control groups receive standard care alone. Outcomes targeted are symptom burden, quality of life, health literacy (capacity to understand and communicate health needs and promote healthy behaviours), disease progress and health care costs.

The aim of this study was to assess the single nucleotide polymorphisms, -1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C, in interleukin-10 gene promoter in inflammatory breast cancer compared to non-inflammatory breast cancer and association of these polymorphisms with interleukin-10 gene expression. We enrolled 105 breast cancer tissue (72 non-inflammatory breast cancer and 33 inflammatory breast cancer) patients and we determined the three studied single nucleotide polymorphisms in all samples by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and investigated their association with the disease and with various prognostic factors. In addition, we assessed the expression of interleukin-10 gene by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the correlation between studied single nucleotide polymorphisms and interleukin-10 messenger RNA expression. We found co-dominant effect as the best inheritance model (in the three studied single nucleotide polymorphisms in non-inflammatory breast cancer and inflammatory breast cancer samples), and we didn't identify any association between single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes and breast cancer prognostic factors. However, GCC haplotype was found highly associated with inflammatory breast cancer risk (p &lt; 0.001, odds ratio = 43.05). Moreover, the expression of interleukin-10 messenger RNA was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) by 5.28-fold and 8.95-fold than non-inflammatory breast cancer and healthy control, respectively, where GCC haplotype significantly increased interleukin-10 gene expression (r = 0.9, p &lt; 0.001).</AbstractText>\n"

The majority of breast cancer deaths are due to cancer progression/recurrence for which no efficient therapies exist. Aggressive breast cancers are characterized by loss of cellular differentiation. Defining molecular mechanisms/targets contributing to cancer aggressiveness is needed to guide the design of new screening and targeted treatments. Here, we describe a novel tumor promoting function for the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor-6 (CPSF6). Importantly, aggressive breast cancer cells of luminal B, HER2-overexpressing and triple negative subtypes show dependency on CPSF6 for viability and tumorigenic capacity. Mechanistically, we found CPSF6 to interact with components of the A-to-I RNA editing machinery, paraspeckles and ADAR1 enzyme, and to be required for their physical integrity. Clinically, we found CPSF6 and all core paraspeckles proteins to be overexpressed in human breast cancer cases and their expression to correlate with poor patient outcomes. Finally, we found prolactin, a key mammary differentiation factor, to suppress CPSF6/RNA editing activity. Together, this study revealed CPSF6 as a molecular target with clinical relevance for prognosis and therapy in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

It is crucial to find potential biomarkers of prognostic value in breast cancer. In this study, the expression pattern of anterior gradient protein 2 in breast cancer was identified based on the main molecular subgroups. Through analysis of 69 samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we found that anterior gradient protein 2 expression was significantly higher in non-triple-negative breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues and triple-negative breast cancer tissues (p &lt; 0.05). The data from a total of 622 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analysed. The data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and results from quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction also verified the anterior gradient protein 2 expression pattern. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis. The quantification results revealed that anterior gradient protein 2 is highly expressed in non-triple-negative breast cancer (grade 3 excluded) and grade 1 + 2 (triple-negative breast cancer excluded) tumours compared with normal tissues. Anterior gradient protein 2 was significantly highly expressed in non-triple-negative breast cancer (grade 3 excluded) and non-triple-negative breast cancer tissues compared with triple-negative breast cancer tissues (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, anterior gradient protein 2 was significantly highly expressed in grade 1 + 2 (triple-negative breast cancer excluded) and grade 1 + 2 tissues compared with grade 3 tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis by Fisher's exact test revealed that anterior gradient protein 2 expression was significantly associated with histologic type, histological grade, oestrogen status and progesterone status. Univariate analysis of clinicopathological variables showed that anterior gradient protein 2 expression, tumour size and lymph node status were significantly correlated with overall survival in patients with grade 1 and 2 tumours. Cox multivariate analysis revealed anterior gradient protein 2 as a putative independent indicator of unfavourable outcomes (p = 0.031). All these data clearly showed that anterior gradient protein 2 is highly expressed in breast cancer and can be regarded as a putative biomarker for breast cancer prognosis.</AbstractText>\n"

"28666462","2017/07/02 06:00","Two distinct mTORC2-dependent pathways converge on Rac1 to drive breast cancer metastasis.","<AbstractText Label=\"BACKGROUND\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">The importance of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling complex in tumor progression is becoming increasingly recognized. HER2-amplified breast cancers use Rictor/mTORC2 signaling to drive tumor formation, tumor cell survival and resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy. Cell motility, a key step in the metastatic process, can be activated by mTORC2 in luminal and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, but its role in promoting metastases from HER2-amplified breast cancers is not yet clear.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Because Rictor is an obligate cofactor of mTORC2, we genetically engineered Rictor ablation or overexpression in mouse and human HER2-amplified breast cancer models for modulation of mTORC2 activity. Signaling through mTORC2-dependent pathways was also manipulated using pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR, Akt, and Rac. Signaling was assessed by western analysis and biochemical pull-down assays specific for Rac-GTP and for active Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Metastases were assessed from spontaneous tumors and from intravenously delivered tumor cells. Motility and invasion of cells was assessed using Matrigel-coated transwell assays.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">We found that Rictor ablation potently impaired, while Rictor overexpression increased, metastasis in spontaneous and intravenously seeded models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Additionally, migration and invasion of HER2-amplified human breast cancer cells was diminished in the absence of Rictor, or upon pharmacological mTOR kinase inhibition. Active Rac1 was required for Rictor-dependent invasion and motility, which rescued invasion/motility in Rictor depleted cells. Rictor/mTORC2-dependent dampening of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor RhoGDI2, a factor that correlated directly with increased overall survival in HER2-amplified breast cancer patients, promoted Rac1 activity and tumor cell invasion/migration. The mTORC2 substrate Akt did not affect RhoGDI2 dampening, but partially increased Rac1 activity through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, thus partially rescuing cell invasion/motility. The mTORC2 effector protein kinase C (PKC)α did rescue Rictor-mediated RhoGDI2 downregulation, partially rescuing Rac-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and migration/motility.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">These findings suggest that mTORC2 uses two coordinated pathways to activate cell invasion/motility, both of which converge on Rac1. Akt signaling activates Rac1 through the Rac-GEF Tiam1, while PKC signaling dampens expression of the endogenous Rac1 inhibitor, RhoGDI2.</AbstractText>\n"

Overall survival was independent of radiation sequence (HR 1; P = 0.95). Neoadjuvant RT also resulted in a lower HR for second primary cancer among estrogen receptor-positive patients who underwent mastectomy compared with those who received adjuvant RT (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.87; P = 0.0162).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Neoadjuvant RT may significantly improve disease-free survival without reducing overall survival, especially for estrogen receptor-positive patients with early-stage breast cancer.

Small-interfering RNA, or siRNA, is one of the tools utilized in this regard, but specially-designed delivery agents are required to allow the siRNA to gain optimal access to the cell interior. Our laboratory has utilized two different siRNA-binding delivery peptides containing a polyarginine core, and modified by myristoylation and targeting motifs (iRGD or Lyp-1). A third peptide was designed to assist with endosomal release. Various ratios of the peptides and siRNA were combined and assayed for the ability to form stable complexes, and optimized ratios were determined. The complexes were found to form particles, with the majority having a diameter of 100-300 nm, as visualized by electron microscopy. These siRNA complexes have enhanced protection from nucleases present in serum, as compared to &quot;naked&quot; unprotected siRNA. The particles were internalized by the cells and could be detected in the cell cytoplasm by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In functional assays, peptide/siRNA complexes were shown to cause the knock down of corresponding targeted proteins. The peptide with the LyP-1 targeting motif was more effective at knockdown in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells than the peptide with the iRGD motif. Inclusion of the endosomal release peptide in the complexes greatly enhanced the peptide/siRNA effects. Peptide/siRNA complexes simultaneously targeting Stat3 and c-Myc caused a marked reduction in anchorage-independent growth, a property correlated with tumorigenicity. This study demonstrates the ability of a peptide-based siRNA-delivery system to deliver siRNA into breast cancer cells and cause both protein knockdown and suppression of the malignant phenotype. Such peptide complexes are likely to become highly useful siRNA-delivery vehicles for the characterization, and potentially for the treatment, of human cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

In this study, we used a morphology-based optical cell separation process to classify a heterogeneous cancer cell population into characteristic subpopulations. To classify the cell subpopulations, we assessed their morphology in hydrogel, a three-dimensional culture environment that induces morphological changes according to the characteristics of the cells (i.e., growth, migration, and invasion). We encapsulated the murine breast cancer cell line 4T1E, as a heterogeneous population that includes highly metastatic cells, in click-crosslinkable and photodegradable gelatin hydrogels, which we developed previously. We observed morphological changes within 3 days of encapsulating the cells in the hydrogel. We separated the 4T1E cell population into colony- and granular-type cells by optical separation, in which local UV-induced degradation of the photodegradable hydrogel around the target cells enabled us to collect those cells. The obtained colony- and granular-type cells were evaluated in vitro by using a spheroid assay and in vivo by means of a tumor growth and metastasis assay. The spheroid assay showed that the colony-type cells formed compact spheroids in 2 days, whereas the granular-type cells did not form spheroids. The tumor growth assay in mice revealed that the granular-type cells exhibited lower tumor growth and a different metastasis behavior compared with the colony-type cells. These results suggest that morphology-based optical cell separation is a useful technique to classify a heterogeneous cancer cell population according to its cellular characteristics.</AbstractText>\n"

This technique has been shown to be an effective and safe non-pharmaceutical treatment with fewer serious complications and better outcome than other treatments for breast cancer. Every year, hundreds of thousands of patients around the world benefit from brachytherapy, which reliably delivers a relatively higher radiation dose to the intended target. However, the follow-up time, patient eligibility criteria, treatment strategy, and radiation doses used in published studies are somewhat inconsistent, making it difficult to strictly compare and evaluate the performance of the treatment. More rigorous studies are required to confirm the safety of this technique and to make outcome data more comparable. In this review, we focus on recent advances in breast brachytherapy techniques and provide an overview of outcomes, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, complications, and limitations of brachytherapy for the treatment of breast cancer. We also summarize the clinical outcomes and toxicity results in patients receiving or not receiving brachytherapy.</AbstractText>\n"

Today, post-transcriptional protein products of the genes involved in breast cancer can be identified by immunohistochemistry. However, this method has problems arising from the intra-observer and inter-observer variability in the assessment of pathologic variables, which may result in misleading conclusions. Using an optimal selection of preprocessing techniques may help to reduce observer variability. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful technique for any tasks related to machine learning such as classification and regression. The aim of this work is to use autoencoders (neural networks commonly used to feed deep learning architectures) to improve the quality of the data for developing immunohistochemistry signatures with prognostic value in breast cancer. Our testing on data from 222 patients with invasive non-special type breast carcinoma shows that an automatic binarization of experimental data after autoencoding could outperform other classical preprocessing techniques (such as human-dependent or automatic binarization only) when applied to the prognosis of breast cancer by immunohistochemical signatures.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated a non-anthracycline-based regimen in TOP2A-normal patients. Patients and Methods In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 2,012 women with early TOP2A-normal breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 3 weeks (DC) or three cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) followed by three cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; EC-D). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) after a median of 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points were patient-reported toxicity, overall survival (OS), and distant disease-free survival. Results At a median estimated potential follow-up of 69 months, 5-year DFS was 87.9% (95% CI, 85.6% to 89.8%) in the EC-D arm and 88.3% (95% CI, 86.1% to 90.1%) in the DC arm. There was no significant difference in the risk of DFS events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.28; P = 1.00), distant disease-free survival (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.47; P = .40), or mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.59; P = .41) in the intent-to-treat analysis. A significant interaction between menopausal status and treatment group was observed for DFS ( P = .04) but not for OS ( P = .07). Patients with grade 3 tumors derived most benefit from DC, and patients with grade 1 to 2 tumors derived most benefit from EC-D (DFS: interaction P = .02; and OS: interaction P = .03). Patients receiving EC-D reported significantly more stomatitis, myalgia or arthralgia, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy, whereas edema was more frequent after DC.

IBIS-I was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of tamoxifen in reducing the risk of breast cancer among women at increased risk of the disease. Participants and Methods Women were randomly assigned to tamoxifen versus placebo (20 mg/day; n = 4,279). After 456 exclusions, 3,823 women were included in this analysis. Adherence (&lt; 4.5 years or ≥ 4.5 years) was calculated using data from six monthly clinical visits. Analyses were adjusted for age, Tyrer-Cuzick risk, smoking, use of hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, baseline menopausal symptoms, and treatment. Results Overall, 69.7% of women were adherent for at least 4.5 years (tamoxifen: 65.2% v placebo: 74.0%; P &lt; .001). Differences in adherence between treatment arms were observed from 12 months onward (all P &lt; .01) and were largest at 54 months. Dropout rates were highest in the first 12 to 18 months and decreased thereafter. Women reporting nausea/vomiting were less likely to be adherent in both the tamoxifen (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86; P = .007) and placebo (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; P = .023) arms. Headaches were associated with adherence only in the placebo arm (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.91; P = .016), whereas gynecologic symptoms were significant only in the tamoxifen arm (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; P = .024). Effect sizes for each symptom on adherence were not significantly different between the treatment groups ( P &gt; .05). In both treatment arms, we observed significant trends for lower adherence with increasing severity for all symptoms ( P &lt; .01) except headaches ( P = .054). Conclusion In the IBIS-I trial, experiencing predefined symptoms in the first 6 months reduced long-term adherence. Effects were similar between treatment arms, suggesting that women were attributing age-related symptoms to preventive therapy.

From January 2001 to February 2008, a total of 353 node-negative T1 to T2 breast cancer cases treated with mastectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Preliminary screening of the prognostic factors was accomplished by Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis, and survival curves between different groups were compared by log-rank test. Risk factors were determined using Cox proportional hazards model. A categorical risk scoring system was generated according to the Cox model, weighing the relative importance of each risk variable. Median follow-up was 115.7 months (range, 1.2-238.4 months). The overall 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was 89.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 86.7%-92.9%). Chest wall (53.8%) was found to be the most common site of LRR, followed by supraclavicular nodes (48.7%). Age ≤40 years, primary tumor size ≥4.5 cm and number of nodes resected ≤10 were found to be independent factors for poor prognosis of LRR. Two risk stratifications based on the scoring system were subsequently obtained. The 5-year LRFS was 91.6% (95% CI = 88.5%-94.7%) with low risk (score &lt;2) and 75.7% (95% CI = 61.8%-89.6%) with high risk (score ≥2), respectively (χ = 7.544, P = .006). In addition, significant differences in overall survival (P = .045) and disease-free survival (P = .019) were presented between them. Patients with T1-2N0M0 breast cancer achieved favorable prognosis in general. Those with risk factors, including age ≤40 years, primary tumor size ≥4.5 cm and number of nodes resected ≤10, were at higher risk of LRR. The established scoring system could help to distinguish the subgroups that might potentially benefit from postoperative radiotherapy.</AbstractText>\n"

To facilitate our search, we used a simple adamantyl ligand core that by avoiding stereochemical issues enabled rapid synthesis of acrylate ketone, ester, and amide analogs. All compounds were high affinity estrogen receptor α (ERα) ligands but displayed a range of efficacies and potencies as antiproliferative and ERα-downregulating agents. There were large differences in activity between compounds having minor structural changes, but antiproliferative and ERα-downregulating efficacies generally paralleled one another. Some compounds with side chain polar groups had particularly high affinities.

Tumor stage was classified according to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program summary stage (in situ/localized/regional/distant). We used highest education level attained to estimate SEP (low/middle/high). Further demographic characteristics of interest were age at presentation (30-49/50-69/70-84 years), living in a canton with organized screening (yes/no), urbanity of residence (urban/peri-urban/rural), civil status (single/married/widowed/divorced) and nationality (Swiss/non-Swiss). We used ordered logistic regression models to analyze factors associated with BC stage at presentation and competing risk regression models for factors associated with survival. Odds of later-stage BC were significantly increased for low SEP women (odds ratio 1.19, 95%CI 1.06-1.34) compared to women of high SEP. Further, women living in a canton without organized screening program, women diagnosed outside the targeted screening age and single/widowed/divorced women were more often diagnosed at later stages. Women of low SEP experienced an increased risk of dying from BC (sub-hazard ratio 1.22, 95%CI 1.05-1.43) compared to women of high SEP. Notably, these survival inequalities could not be explained by socioeconomic differences in stage at presentation and/or other sociodemographic factors. It is concerning that these social gradients have been observed in a country with universal health insurance coverage, high health expenditures and one of the highest life expectancies in the world.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Methods In SOFT, women still premenopausal after surgery with or without chemotherapy were randomly assigned to tamoxifen alone, tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS), or exemestane plus OFS. In TEXT, all received OFS with or without concomitant chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. We summarize treatment efficacy, quality of life, and adherence of the cohort of women younger than 35 years in SOFT and TEXT, alongside data from the cohort of older premenopausal women. Results For 240 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative patients younger than 35 years enrolled in SOFT after receiving chemotherapy, the 5-year breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was 67.1% (95% CI, 54.6% to 76.9%) with tamoxifen alone, 75.9% with tamoxifen plus OFS (95% CI, 64.0% to 84.4%), and 83.2% with exemestane plus OFS (95% CI, 72.7% to 90.0%). For 145 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative patients younger than 35 years in TEXT, 5-year BCFI was 79.2% (95% CI, 66.2% to 87.7%) with tamoxifen plus OFS and 81.6% (95% CI, 69.8% to 89.2%) with exemestane plus OFS. The most prominent quality of life symptom for patients younger than 35 years receiving OFS was vasomotor symptoms, with the greatest worsening from baseline at 6 months (on the order of 30 to 40 points), but loss of sexual interest and difficulties in becoming aroused were also clinically meaningful (≥ 8-point change). The level of symptom burden was similar in older premenopausal women. A total of 19.8% of women younger than 35 years stopped all protocol-assigned endocrine therapy early. Conclusion In women younger than 35 years with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, adjuvant OFS combined with tamoxifen or exemestane produces large improvements in BCFI compared with tamoxifen alone. Menopausal symptoms are significant but are not worse than those seen in older premenopausal women.</AbstractText>\n"

Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study included 52 women who underwent breast MR imaging and contrast-enhanced spectral mammography for newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer between March 2014 and October 2015. Of those 52 patients, 46 were referred for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography and targeted ultrasonography because they had additional suspicious lesions at MR imaging. In six of the 52 patients, breast cancer had been diagnosed at an outside institution. These patients were referred for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography and targeted US as part of diagnostic imaging. Images from contrast-enhanced spectral mammography were analyzed by two fellowship-trained breast imagers with 2.5 years of experience with contrast-enhanced spectral mammography. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value were calculated for both imaging modalities and compared by using the Bennett statistic. Results Fifty-two women with 120 breast lesions were included for analysis (mean age, 50 years; range, 29-73 years). Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography had similar sensitivity to MR imaging (94% [66 of 70 lesions] vs 99% [69 of 70 lesions]), a significantly higher PPV than MR imaging (93% [66 of 71 lesions] vs 60% [69 of 115 lesions]), and fewer false-positive findings than MR imaging (five vs 45) (P &lt; .001 for all results). In addition, contrast-enhanced spectral mammography depicted 11 of the 11 secondary cancers (100%) and MR imaging depicted 10 (91%). Conclusion Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography is potentially as sensitive as MR imaging in the evaluation of extent of disease in newly diagnosed breast cancer, with a higher PPV. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017.</AbstractText>\n"

From 2010 to 2013, patients with a diagnosis of de novo stage-IV breast cancer were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the effect of distant metastases sites on breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. A total of 7575 patients were identified. The most common metastatic sites were bone, followed by lung, liver, and brain. Patients with hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- and hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ status were more prone to bone metastases. Lung and brain metastases were common in hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ and hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- subtypes, and patients with hormone receptor+/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ and hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ subtypes were more prone to liver metastases. Patients with liver and brain metastases had unfavorable prognosis for breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival, whereas bone and lung metastases had no effect on patient survival in multivariate analyses. The hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- subtype conferred a significantly poorer outcome in terms of breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ disease was associated with the best prognosis in terms of breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Patients with liver and brain metastases were more likely to experience poor prognosis for breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival by various breast cancer subtypes. Distant metastases sites have differential impact on clinical outcomes in stage-IV breast cancer. Follow-up screening for brain and liver metastases might be effective in improving breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival.</AbstractText>\n"

This study aimed to analyze the related factors that may affect the TVDT of breast cancer by three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 69 breast cancer patients were selected. 3D-US was applied to measure the volume of breast lumps diagnosed as BI-RADS-US 4A by conventional ultrasound. TVDT was calculated according to the formula TVDT=DT×log2/log(V2/V1). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the factors influencing breast cancer TVDT. RESULTS The mean and median TVDT were 185±126 (range 66-521) and 164 days, respectively. TVDT showed no statistical significance according to regular shape, coarse margin, spicule sign, peripheral hyperechoic halo, microcalcification, and different posterior echo characteristics (P&gt;0.05). Patients grouped by age, axillary lymphatic metastasis, histological differentiation, and Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) score exhibited significantly different TVDT (P&lt;0.05). On the contrary, patients with different menstrual conditions, breast cancer family history, or pathological types presented similar TVDT (P&gt;0.05). TVDT was obviously different in breast cancer with different ER, PR, Ki-67, and molecular subtyping but not HER2 expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that NPI score, axillary lymphatic metastasis, Ki-67, and molecular subtyping were risk factors of TVDT in breast cancer (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS Breast cancer TVDT was significantly correlated with NPI score, axillary lymphatic metastasis, Ki-67, and molecular subtyping. Triple-negative breast cancer exhibited the most rapid growth.</AbstractText>\n"

Despite the role it may play in tumor progression and response to therapy, microenvironmental (stromal) heterogeneity in TNBC has not been well characterized. To address this challenge, we investigated the transcriptome of tumor-associated stroma isolated from TNBC (<i>n</i> = 57). We identified four stromal axes enriched for T cells (T), B cells (B), epithelial markers (E), or desmoplasia (D). Our analysis method (STROMA4) assigns a score along each stromal axis for each patient and then combined the axis scores to subtype patients. Analysis of these subtypes revealed that prognostic capacity of the B, T, and E scores was governed by the D score. When compared with a previously published TNBC subtyping scheme, the STROMA4 method better captured tumor heterogeneity and predicted patient benefit from therapy with increased sensitivity. This approach produces a simple ontology that captures TNBC heterogeneity and informs how tumor-associated properties interact to affect prognosis. <i>Cancer Res; 77(17); 4673-83. ©2017 AACR</i>.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

However, some patients developed recurrence and distant metastasis after surgery. Adjuvant therapy is considered for high-risk patients depending on several prognostic markers, and lymphovascular invasion has become one of such prognostic markers that help physicians to identify the risk for distant metastasis and recurrence. However, the mechanism of lymphovascular invasion in breast cancer remains unknown. This study aims to unveil the genes and pathways that may involve in lymphovascular invasion in breast cancer. In total, 108 breast cancer samples were collected during surgery and microarray analysis was performed. Significance analysis of the microarrays and limma package for R were used to examine differentially expressed genes between lymphovascular invasion-positive and lymphovascular invasion-negative cases. Network and pathway analyses were mapped using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. In total, 86 differentially expressed genes, including 37 downregulated genes and 49 upregulated genes were identified in lymphovascular invasion-positive patients. Among these genes, TNFSF11, IL6ST, and EPAS1 play important roles in cytokine-receptor interaction, which is the most enriched pathway related to lymphovascular invasion. Moreover, the results also suggested that an imbalance between extracellular matrix components and tumor micro-environment could induce lymphovascular invasion. Our study evaluated the underlying mechanisms of lymphovascular invasion, which may further help to assess the risk of breast cancer progression and identify potential targets of adjuvant treatment.</AbstractText>\n"

However, conventional grading has proven technically challenging, and up to 60% of the tumors are classified as histological grade 2, which represents a heterogeneous cohort less informative for clinical decision making. In an attempt to study and extend the molecular puzzle of histologically graded breast cancer, we have in this pilot project searched for additional protein biomarkers in a new space of the proteome. To this end, we have for the first time performed protein expression profiling of breast cancer tumor tissue, using recombinant antibody microarrays, targeting mainly immunoregulatory proteins. Thus, we have explored the immune system as a disease-specific sensor (clinical immunoproteomics). Uniquely, the results showed that several biologically relevant proteins reflecting histological grade could be delineated. In more detail, the tentative biomarker panels could be used to i) build a candidate model classifying grade 1 vs. grade 3 tumors, ii) demonstrate the molecular heterogeneity among grade 2 tumors, and iii) potentially re-classify several of the grade 2 tumors to more like grade 1 or grade 3 tumors. This could, in the long-term run, lead to improved prognosis, by which the patients could benefit from improved tailored care.</AbstractText>\n"

Neratinib, an orally available pan-inhibitor of the ERBB family, represents an interesting new option for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Areas covered: In this article, the development of neratinib, with a special focus on its potential value in the treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, has been reviewed. For this purpose, a literature search was conducted, including preclinical studies, early-phase trials in advanced cancer with neratinib in monotherapy and in combination, and phase II and large phase III trials in the early setting. Management of neratinib-induced toxicity, future perspectives for the drug, and ongoing trials are also discussed in this review. Expert commentary: Neratinib is emerging as a promising oral drug for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Although FDA and EMA approval is derived from the extended adjuvant treatment, this setting may not be the ideal scenario to obtain the beneficial effects of neratinib. Confirmatory data in the neoadjuvant setting and subgroup analysis from the ExTENET trial might bring some light into the best setting for neratinib therapy. Data from confirmatory trials in the metastatic setting are also required.</AbstractText>\n"

We aimed in this study to assess the immunohistochemical expression of EGFR and cytokeratin 5/6 and their ability to predict survival and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) among triple-negative breast cancer patients. Thirty-five cases with TNBC were studied by immunohistochemistry for EGFR and CK5/6 expression. Data on overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and response to NAC were collected.

Before the introduction of widespread mammographic screening in the mid-1980s, the death rate from breast cancer in the US had remained unchanged for more than 4 decades. Since 1990, the death rate has declined by at least 38%. Much of this change is attributed to early detection with mammography. ACR breast cancer screening experts have reviewed data from RCTs, observational studies, US screening data, and other peer-reviewed literature to update our recommendations. Mammography screening has consistently been shown to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality over a variety of study designs. The ACR recommends annual mammography screening starting at age 40 for women of average risk of developing breast cancer. Our recommendation is based on maximizing proven benefits, which include a substantial reduction in breast cancer mortality afforded by regular screening and improved treatment options for those diagnosed with breast cancer. The risks associated with mammography screening are also considered to assist women in making an informed choice.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 American College of Radiology.

The breast is a rare site of metastasis of essentially any and every type of tumor, including carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematolymphoid neoplasms, and 10-30% of breast metastases may represent the initial presentation of disease. Although metastases generally recapitulate histologic features of the primary tumor, they are diagnostically challenging given their rarity and morphologic overlap with breast carcinoma, including special types of breast cancer. Histologic clues may include lack of carcinoma in situ, lack of central elastosis, pattern of infiltration around normal breast structures, yet none of these are specific. Careful correlation with clinical history and judicious use of immunostain panels is essential in approaching these cases.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated the role and utility of CTC monitoring in evaluating the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 286 female triple-negative breast cancer patients who were diagnosed at and received radical resection surgery in our hospital. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected preoperatively and at 3 and 7 days postoperative, and the Cell Search system was used to detect CTC in peripheral blood. We analyzed the relationship between preoperative CTC level and clinical pathological characteristics of patients. Kaplan-Meier method was used to establish progression-free survival curves and overall survival curves, we used the log-rank test to compare the survival rate, and we explored the effects of preoperative and postoperative CTC levels on patient survival. RESULTS Compared with preoperative levels, the average CTC content in peripheral blood of breast cancer patients was significantly increased at 3 days after surgery, and then decreased to the preoperative baseline level by 7 days after surgery. The 3-year overall survival rate and progression-free survival rate in patients with CTC &gt;5/7.5 mL peripheral blood were significantly lower than in patients with CTC &lt;5/7.5 mL peripheral blood detected preoperatively and at 3 and 7 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Dynamic monitoring of preoperative and postoperative CTC levels can accurately predict recurrence and progression of disease, and is important in postoperative monitoring and prognosis evaluation.</AbstractText>\n"

We identified further potentially relevant studies from handsearching references of previous trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Prior to this review update, the most recent search for studies was conducted in May 2003 for the original 2004 review.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"SELECTION CRITERIA\">Randomised trials comparing platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens with regimens not containing platinum in women with metastatic breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\">At least two independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and quality, and extracted all relevant data from each study. Hazard ratios (HRs) were derived for time-to-event outcomes, where possible, and fixed-effect models were used for meta-analyses. Objective tumour response rates (OTRRs) and toxicities were analysed as binary (dichotomous) outcomes with risk ratios (RRs) used as measures of effects. Quality of life data were extracted where available. GRADE was used to rate the quality of evidence for survival and tumour response outcomes at the level of subgroups selected and unselected for mTNBC, and for toxicity outcomes based on combining data from selected and unselected populations.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"MAIN RESULTS\">This update includes 15 new eligible treatment-comparisons from 12 studies. In total, 28 treatment-comparisons, involving 4418 women, from 24 studies are now included in one or more meta-analyses. Of the 28 treatment-comparisons, 19 and 16 had published or provided extractable time-to-event data on overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival/time to progression (PFS/TTP), respectively. All 28 treatment-comparisons provided OTRR data that could be included in meta-analyses. Most women recruited to the studies were not selected on the basis of mTNBC status.In a subgroup of three treatment-comparisons assessing women with mTNBC, platinum-containing regimens may have provided a survival benefit (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). In women unselected for intrinsic subtypes such as mTNBC, there was little or no effect on survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; high-quality evidence). This effect was similar to the combined analysis of survival data for both populations (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07; I<sup>2</sup> =39%, 1868 deaths, 2922 women; 19 trials). The difference in treatment effects between mTNBC women compared with unselected women was of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05).Data from three treatment-comparisons with mTNBC participants showed that platinum regimens may improve PFS/TTP (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.72; low-quality evidence). Thirteen treatment-comparisons of unselected metastatic participants showed that there was probably a small PFS/TTP benefit for platinum recipients, although the confidence interval included no difference (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; moderate-quality evidence). Combined analysis of data from an estimated 1772 women who progressed or died out of 2136 women selected or unselected for mTNBC indicated that platinum-containing regimens improved PFS/TTP (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). There was marked evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.0004; I<sup>2</sup> = 63%). The larger treatment benefit in mTNBC women compared with unselected women was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001).There was low-quality evidence of better tumour response in both subgroups of women with mTNBC and unselected women (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.56; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, respectively). Combined analysis of both populations was closer to the effect in unselected women (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.22; 4130 women). There was considerable evidence of heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 64%), which may reflect between-study differences and general difficulties in assessing response, as well as the varying potencies of the comparators.Compared with women receiving non-platinum regimens: rates of grade 3 and 4 nausea/vomiting were probably higher among women receiving cisplatin- (RR 2.65, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.34; 1731 women; moderate-quality evidence) but the effect from carboplatin-containing regimens was less certain (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.26; 1441 women; moderate-quality evidence); rates of grade 3 and 4 anaemia were higher among women receiving cisplatin- (RR 3.72, 95% CI 2.36 to 5.88; 1644 women; high-quality evidence) and carboplatin-containing regimens (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.70; 1441 women; high-quality evidence); rates of grade 3 and 4 hair loss (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.58; 1452 women; high-quality evidence) and leukopenia (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.57; 3176 women; moderate-quality evidence) were higher among women receiving platinum-containing regimens (regardless of platinum agent).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\">In women with metastatic breast cancer who do not have triple-negative disease, there is high-quality evidence of little or no survival benefit and excess toxicity from platinum-based regimens.

"28642035","2017/06/24 06:00","Improving the efficacy of hormone therapy in breast cancer: The role of cholesterol metabolism in SERM-mediated autophagy, cell differentiation and death.","<AbstractText>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common female cancers in the world, with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC the most frequent subtype. Tamoxifen (Tam) is an effective drug that competitively binds to the ER and is routinely used for the treatment of ER-positive BC. However, a number of ER-positive BC do not respond to Tam treatment and acquired resistance is often observed, constituting a major challenge for extending patient life expectancy. The mechanisms responsible for these treatment failures remain unclear, indicating the requirement for other targets and better predictors for patient response to Tam. One of Tam's off-targets of interest is the microsomal antiestrogen binding site (AEBS), a multiproteic complex made up of the cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase (ChEH) enzymes that are involved in the late stages of cholesterol biosynthesis. Tam and other selective ER modulators stimulate oxidative stress and inhibit the ChEH subunits at pharmacological doses, triggering the production and accumulation of cholesterol-5,6-epoxide metabolites responsible for BC cell differentiation and death. However, inhibition of the cholesterogenic activity of the AEBS subunits also induces the accumulation of sterol precursors, which triggers a survival autophagy to impair Tam's efficacy. Altogether, these studies have highlighted the involvement of cholesterol metabolism in the pharmacology of Tam that has provided new clues on how to improve its therapeutic efficacy in both BC and other cancers as well as offering a new rationale for developing more efficient drugs for BC treatment.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is a marker of stem cells and cancer stem cells, and its activity correlates with the outcome of various tumors, including BC. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between ALDH1 expression and clinicopathological characters in BC and the prognostic significance of ALDH1.We used quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to detect ALDHA1 mRNA levels in 25 fresh frozen BC samples and matched noncancerous samples. Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays was used to analyze protein expression in 137 paraffin-embedded BC tissues and corresponding noncancerous tissues. STATA 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis.The results suggested that levels of both ALDH1 mRNA and protein in BC were significantly higher than in corresponding adjacent breast samples (3.856 ± 0.3442 vs 1.385 ± 0.1534, P &lt; .001; 52.6% vs 25.5%, P &lt; .001, respectively). ALDH1 protein expression was also significantly associated with histological grade (P  =  .017), tumor size (P  =  .017), and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P  =  .038). Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model demonstrated that ALDH1 expression (P  =  .024), molecular typing (P  =  .046), and TNM classification (P  =  .034) were independent predictive factors for the outcome of BC.

The objective of this study was to determine the percentages of circulating M2-like monocytes in patients with breast cancer. Immunofluorescence staining for CD68 and CD163 was performed to detect M2-like macrophages in pathological tissues. Flow cytometry was used to assess the frequencies of circulating CD14<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>CD204<sup>+</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>CD204<sup>+</sup> M2-like monocytes in 99 breast cancer patients, 56 patients with benign breast disease, and 60 healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic values of circulating M2-like monocytes, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 15-3. The associations among circulating M2-like monocytes and clinical breast cancer parameters were analyzed. The number of CD68<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup> M2-like macrophages was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in benign tissues. In the peripheral blood, CD14<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>CD204<sup>+</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>CD204<sup>+</sup> M2-like monocytes were elevated in breast cancer patients compared with normal controls and patients with benign breast disease.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) under non-clinical trial setting, and to study the impact of previous antiangiogenic treatment to the efficacy of apatinib. 52 MBC patients treated with apatinib under non-clinical trial setting in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between January 1st 2015 and October 1st 2016 were included. All patients were included in time-to-treatment failure (TTF) analysis, while 45 patients were enrolled for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) analysis because 7 of the patients with treatment discontinuation due to intolerable toxicities had too short time for efficacy assessment. Impact of previous exposure to antiangiogenic treatment and other factors to patients' survival were analyzed by Log-rank analysis and Cox multivariate analysis. The median PFS, median OS, and median TTF were 4.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.44 - 6.36), 10.3 (unable to calculate 95% CI), and 3.93 (95% CI 1.96 - 5.90) months, respectively. Previous treatment of bevacizumab did not affect the efficacy of apatinib. Previous exposure to anthracycline, age of 60 years or older and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome were independent predictors for prolonged PFS. Discontinuation of treatment was more common in age group of 60 years or older than that in younger group, although the difference was not significant. Although toxicities were generally managable, a previously unrecorded grade 3~4 adverse event of dyspnea has been observed. This study confirmed the encouraging efficacy and manageable safety of apatinib on pretreated MBC patients in non-clinical trial setting. For the first time to our knowledge, this study found that previous treatment of bevacizumab did not affect the efficacy of apatinib, and reported an undocumented severe adverse effect of dyspnea.</AbstractText>\n"

One mutation positive female relative was identified per mutation positive BC patient. Using age of onset below 40 or TNBC as criteria for testing identified 32-34% of carriers. Common guidelines for testing identified 45-90%, and testing all below 60 years identified 90%. Thirty-seven percent of carriers had a family history of cancer that would have qualified for predictive BRCA testing.

All patients were treated with NAC and mastectomy, and achieved ypN0. Of them, 89 patients received additional PMRT and 96 patients did not. 101 patients had clinical stage Ⅱ disease. 84 patients had clinical stage Ⅲ disease. The rates of locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate analysis was used to interpret the impact of clinical features and treatment on patients' outcome. <b>Results:</b> The 5-year rates of LRR, DM, DFS, and OS for all patients were 4.5%, 10.4%, 86.6%, and 97.1%, respectively. For patients with and without PMRT, the 5-year LRR rates were 1.1% and 7.5% (<i>P</i>=0.071), the 5-year DM rates were 5.1% and 15.0% (<i>P</i>=0.023), the 5-year DFS rates were 95.0% and 79.0% (<i>P</i>=0.008), and the 5-year OS rates were 100.0% and 94.5% (<i>P</i>=0.089) respectively. In univariate analysis, lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) was poor prognostic factor of LRR (<i>P</i>=0.001), &lt; 40 years old and lack of PMRT was a poor prognostic factor for DM (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), lack of PMRT was a poor prognostic factor for DFS (<i>P</i>=0.008), primary lesion residual and mild-moderate pathological response to NAC were poor prognostic factors for OS (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). In the subgroup of Stage Ⅲ disease, for patients with and without PMRT, the 5-year LRR rates were 1.9% and 14.4% (<i>P</i>=0.041), the 5-year DFS rates were 91.9% and 67.4% (<i>P</i>=0.022), respectively. In the subgroup of Stage Ⅱ disease, for patients with and without PMRT, the 5-year DM rates were 0 and 11.5% (<i>P</i>=0.044), the 5-year DFS rates were 100.0% and 84.9% (<i>P</i>=0.023), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> The LRR rate of clinical T1-3N1M0 breast cancer patients who achieved ypN0 after NAC and mastectomy was low.

Twelve patients with extensive pure DCIS were included as a representation of indolent lesions with limited invasive capacity. These cases were matched with 12 patients with a limited DCIS component and IBC, representing lesions with a high invasive potential. Matching included age and surrogate DCIS subtypes. Gene expression profiling was performed on DCIS cells to identify transcriptional differences between these two groups. The identified genes were validated by immunohistochemistry. Nine genes showed significantly different expression. Most of these genes were highly expressed in DCIS samples with IBC, including PLAU (P = 0.002), COL1A1 (P = 0.006), KRT81 (P = 0.009), S100A7 (P = 0.015), SCGB1D2 (P = 0.023), KRT18 (P = 0.029), and NOTCH3 (P = 0.044), whereas EGFR and CXCL14 showed a higher expression in cases with pure DCIS (P = 0.015 and P = 0.028, respectively). This difference was only significant for SCGB1D2 (P = 0.009). Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct clustering of patients with and without invasion. Patients with pure DCIS have a different gene expression pattern as compared to patients with DCIS and synchronous IBC.

These studies focused on short-term change, using a 2-stage process, treating estimated change as a fixed covariate in a survival model. We propose the use of a joint longitudinal-survival model. This enables us to model long-term trends in density while accounting for dropout as well as for measurement error. We studied the change in mammographic density after a breast cancer diagnosis and its association with prognosis (measured by cause-specific mortality), overall and with respect to hormone replacement therapy and tamoxifen treatment. We included 1,740 women aged 50-74 years, diagnosed with breast cancer in Sweden during 1993-1995, with follow-up until 2008. They had a total of 6,317 mammographic density measures available from the first 5 years of follow-up, including baseline measures. We found that the impact of the withdrawal of hormone replacement therapy on density reduction was larger than that of tamoxifen treatment. Unlike previous studies, we found that there was an association between density reduction and survival, both for tamoxifen-treated women and women who were not treated with tamoxifen.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

Besides, increasing evidence supports the view that the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) predicts outcome in early and metastatic BC. Consequently, an evaluation of VDR expression in the CTCs of BC patients may allow optimization of their treatment. As an attempt to profile and subtype the CTCs of metastatic patients, we established an innovative fluorescence technique using nine BC cell lines to visualize, define, and compare their individual VDR status. Afterwards, we tested the CTC presence and VDR expression in blood samples (cytospins) collected from 23 metastatic BC patients. The results demonstrated major differences in the VDR levels among the nine cell lines, and VDR positive CTCs were detected in 46% of CTC-positive patients, with a total of 42 CTCs individually analyzed. Due to the limited number of patients in this study, no correlation between VDR expression and BC subtype classification (according to estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2) could be determined, but our data support the view that VDR evaluation is a potential new prognostic biomarker to help in the optimization of therapy management for BC patients.</AbstractText>\n"

Obesity is common among African American women and contributes to breast cancer progression and numerous chronic conditions. Weight loss interventions among breast cancer survivors positively affect weight, behavior, biomarkers, and psychosocial outcomes, yet few target African Americans. This article examines the effects of Moving Forward, a weight loss intervention for African American breast cancer survivors (AABCS) on weight, body composition, and behavior. Patients and Methods Early-stage (I-III) AABCS were randomly assigned to a 6-month interventionist-guided (n = 125) or self-guided (n = 121) weight loss program supporting behavioral changes to promote a 5% weight loss. Anthropometric, body composition, and behavioral data were collected at baseline, postintervention (6 months), and follow-up (12 months). Descriptive statistics and mixed models analyses assessed differences between groups over time. Results Mean (± standard deviation) age, and body mass index were 57.5 (± 10.1) years and 36.1 (± 6.2) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and 82% had stage I or II breast cancer. Both groups lost weight. Mean and percentage of weight loss were greater in the guided versus self-guided group (at 6 months: 3.5 kg v 1.3kg; P &lt; .001; 3.6% v 1.4%; P &lt; .001, respectively; at 12 months: 2.7 kg v 1.6 kg; P &lt; .05; 2.6% v 1.6%; P &lt; .05, respectively); 44% in the guided group and 19% in the self-guided group met the 5% goal. Body composition and behavioral changes were also greater in the interventionist-guided group at both time points. Conclusion The study supports the efficacy of a community-based interventionist-guided weight loss program targeting AABCS.

Our study identifies predictors of BRCA testing among Black women treated for breast cancer and examines differences between BRCA testers and nontesters. We conducted an analysis of 945 Black women ages 18-64 diagnosed with localized or regional-stage invasive breast cancer in Pennsylvania and Florida between 2007 and 2009. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of BRCA 1/2 testing. Few (27%) (n = 252) of the participants reported having BRCA testing. In the multivariate analysis, we found that perceived benefits of BRCA testing (predisposing factor) ([OR], 1.16; 95% CI: 1.11-1.21; P &lt; 0.001), income (enabling factor) ([OR], 2.10; 95% CI: 1.16-3.80; p = 0.014), and BRCA mutation risk category (need factor) ([OR], 3.78; 95% CI: 2.31-6.19; P &lt; 0.001) predicted BRCA testing. These results suggest that interventions to reduce disparities in BRCA testing should focus on identifying patients with high risk of mutation, increasing patient understanding of the benefits of BRCA testing, and removing financial and other administrative barriers to genetic testing.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors.

"28624391","2017/06/19 06:00","Efficacy of melatonin, IL-25 and siIL-17B in tumorigenesis-associated properties of breast cancer cell lines.","<AbstractText>Mammary tumorigenesis can be modulated by melatonin, which has oncostatic action mediated by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB and modulation of interleukins (ILs) expression. IL-25 is an active cytokine that induces apoptosis in tumor cells due to differential expression of its receptor (IL-17RB). IL-17B competes with IL-25 for binding to IL-17RB in tumor cells, promoting tumorigenesis. This study purpose is to address the possibility of engaging IL-25/IL-17RB signaling to enhance the effect of melatonin on breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cell lines were cultured monolayers and 3D structures and treated with melatonin, IL-25, siIL-17B, each alone or in combination. Cell viability, gene and protein expression of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3 and VEGF-A were performed by qPCR and immunofluorescence. In addition, an apoptosis membrane array was performed in metastatic cells. Treatments with melatonin and IL-25 significantly reduced tumor cells viability at 1mM and 1ng/mL, respectively, but did not alter cell viability of a non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). All treatments, alone and combined, significantly increased cleaved caspase-3 in tumor cells grown as monolayers and 3D structures (p&lt;0.05). Semi-quantitative analysis of apoptosis pathway proteins showed an increase of CYTO-C, DR6, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5, IGFPB-6, IGF-1, IGF-1R, Livin, P21, P53, TNFRII, XIAP and hTRA proteins and reduction of caspase-3 (p&lt;0.05) after melatonin treatment. All treatments reduced VEGF-A protein expression in tumor cells (p&lt;0.05). Our results suggest therapeutic potential, with oncostatic effectiveness, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties for melatonin and IL-25-driven signaling in breast cancer cells.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

There are no specific clinical and radiological features for the diagnosis of this tumor and histological features are also reported to be nonspecific. Therefore, immunohistochemistry is required for its diagnosis.

She experienced local recurrence and she had multiple left breast lumps four times in a very short period after repeated surgeries. However, she was later managed successfully with chemotherapy and locoregional radiotherapy. A chemotherapy protocol with ifosfamide, vincristine, and actinomycin was used and radiotherapy was given with a total dose of 50 Gy given in 25 fractions of 2 Gy by a 6 MV photon linear accelerator followed by 10 Gy boost given in 5 fractions of 2 Gy by 9 MeV electron energy.

To understand whether and how the aberrant enhancer activation may contribute to cancer risk, the differentially methylated enhancers (eDMRs) in normal and malignant breast tissues were identified and analyzed. By incorporating genome-wide chromatin interaction, integrated analysis of eDMRs and target gene expression identified 1,272 enhancer-promoter pairs. Surprisingly, two functionally distinct groups of genes were identified in these pairs, one showing better correlation to enhancer methylation (eRGs) and the other showing better correlation to promoter methylation (pRGs), and the former group is functionally enriched with cancer related genes. Moreover, enhancer methylation based clustering of breast cancer samples is capable of discriminating basal breast cancer from other subtypes. By correlating enhancer methylation status to patient survival, 345 enhancers show the impact on the disease outcome and the majority of their target genes are important regulators of cell survival pathways including known cancer related genes. Together, these results suggest reactivation of enhancers in cancer cells has the add-on effect and contributes to cancer risk in combination.</AbstractText>\n"

Pathological complete response has been proposed as a surrogate marker for the prediction of long-term clinical benefits; however, 50%-85% patients have an unfavorable pathological complete response to chemotherapy. MicroRNAs are known biomarkers of breast cancer progression; nevertheless, their potential to identify patients with pathological complete response remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether a microRNA profile could be associated with pathological complete response in triple-negative breast cancer patients receiving 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide-cisplatin/paclitaxel as a novel neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the discovery cohort, the expression of 754 microRNAs was examined in tumors from 10 triple-negative breast cancer patients who achieved pathological complete response and 8 without pathological complete response using TaqMan Low-Density Arrays. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified 11 microRNAs with significant differences between responder and no-responder patients (fold change ≥ 1.5; p &lt; 0.05). The differential expression of miR-30a, miR-9-3p, miR-770, and miR-143-5p was validated in an independent group of 17 patients with or without pathological complete response. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that expression of these four microRNAs was associated with an increased disease-free survival. Gene ontology classification of predicted microRNA targets indicated that numerous genes are involved in pathways related to chemoresistance, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, focal adhesion kinase, WNT, ERbB, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and AKT signaling. In summary, we identified a novel microRNA expression signature associated with pathological complete response in breast cancer. We propose that the four validated microRNAs could be used as molecular biomarkers of clinical response in triple-negative breast cancer patients with pathological complete response to neoadjuvant therapy.</AbstractText>\n"

A simple and instructive biomarker for the postoperative recurrence and metastasis is needed to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Plasma fibrinogen level has been shown to be associated with tumor progression and poor outcomes in breast cancer patients. This study aims to further evaluate the clinical and prognostic value of plasma fibrinogen level as a biomarker in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this study, data of 67 patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed to identify the relationship between the plasma fibrinogen level and the clinical progression and outcome of these patients. Patients with increased plasma fibrinogen level after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In a univariate survival analysis, molecular type (p = 0.0004/p = 0.005), clinical response (p = 0.008/p = 0.015), and changes in plasma fibrinogen level (p = 0.012/p = 0.007) were associated with disease-free survival and overall survival, and all of them, molecular type (p = 0.0003/p = 0.005), clinical response (p = 0.027/p = 0.021), and changes in plasma fibrinogen level (p = 0.035/p = 0.025), were associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in a multivariate survival analysis, respectively.

The status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been proposed to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. We investigated the clinical significance and value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and brachyury as biomarkers to predict treatment responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. We also examined the correlation of the Neo-Bioscore with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and brachyury to indirectly predict long-term outcome. This retrospective study included a series of 44 consecutive patients treated between January 2011 and December 2015. All patient samples were obtained using core needle biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The relationship of expression of Brachyury and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subsets (CD8+, forkhead box protein 3 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) with clinicopathological factors was assessed to identify its predictive role with respect to tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the outcome. Of 44 patients, 6 showed no response, 31 had partial response, and 7 demonstrated pathological complete response. Forkhead box protein 3 was significantly higher in the response group than in the no response group (no response = 2.6, partial response = 7.0, complete response = 9.7, p = 0.020). Brachyury expression was inversely associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.62). We also observed a significant association between forkhead box protein 3 ( p = 0.001) and the Neo-Bioscore, while only a marginal difference was observed with CD8+ expression ( p = 0.074). This study demonstrated that forkhead box protein 3 expression has value as the only independent marker that predicts a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and that it is related with a good prognosis according to the Neo-Bioscore. Brachyury was significantly associated with estrogen receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative status; further study would be needed to clarify how it affects treatment prognosis.</AbstractText>\n"

EAET showed no advantage in overall survival (OS) from all causes mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.09); P = 0.67). On the other hand, compared with standard therapy, the pooled effects showed that EAET was associated with improvement in breast cancer-specific survival (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.96; P = 0.004), disease-free survival (DFS) (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.75-0.99; P = 0.002), disease recurrence (OR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.64-0.90; P = 0.001), and contralateral breast recurrence (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.93; P = 0.008). Improvement in DFS or disease recurrence was not shown in studies that compared 5 years of tamoxifen versus tamoxifen beyond 5 years. Subgroup analysis showed that EAET conferred more benefit for patients with positive lymph nodes. Rates of positive lymph nodes, the study size, and the median duration of follow-up were identified as variables that explained most of the demonstrated data heterogeneity. EAET should be considered as a preferred strategy for high-risk hormone-positive early breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes; however, the benefit on OS could not be demonstrated.</AbstractText>\n"

Thus, RhoGAP proteins, which negatively regulate Rho GTPases, are generally thought to function as tumor suppressors. Here this expectation was challenged by characterization of ARHGAP18, a RhoGAP family member that is selectively overexpressed in highly migratory triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. In human breast tumors, higher ARHGAP18 levels associated with worse overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival. In TNBC cells, ARHGAP18 deletion increased RhoA activation but reduced growth, migration, and metastatic capacity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that ARHGAP18 levels were controlled by miR-200b, the enforced expression of which was sufficient to activate RhoA, enhanced formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, and reduced migration and metastasis. Enforced elevation of ARHGAP18 where miR-200b was stably expressed reduced RhoA activity but increased cell migration. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Rho effector kinase ROCK blocked RhoA signaling and reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-200b on cell migration. Finally, ARHGAP18 overexpression or ROCK inhibition was sufficient to overcome metastatic blockade by miR-200b. Taken together, these results define opposing roles for oncogenic ARHGAP18 and tumor suppressive miR-200b in determining TNBC cell migration and metastatic prowess. <i>Cancer Res; 77(15); 4051-64. ©2017 AACR</i>.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

However, to our knowledge, the role of Noxin in regulating cell proliferation is still controversial and there are no reports of the function and clinicopathological association in breast cancer. In this study, immunohistochemistry results showed that Noxin expression was significantly correlated with advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage ( p = 0.027), positive regional lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.002), and poor overall survival ( p = 0.002). Proliferation assay results showed that Noxin obviously promoted the ability of proliferation of normal breast cells. Subsequent western blot results revealed that Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 were upregulated by overexpressing Noxin, whereas Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 were downregulated after depleting Noxin. The levels of phosphorylated P38 and activating transcription factor 2 were obviously increased after overexpressing Noxin, and their expression was downregulated accordingly by transfecting Noxin-small interfering RNA. Moreover, P38 inhibitor counteracted the elevating expression of phosphorylated activating transcription factor 2, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1 induced by Noxin overexpression and thereby reversed the effect of Noxin overexpression on facilitating cell growth. Taken together, our studies indicated that Noxin was overexpressed in breast cancer and its positive expression was significantly correlated with advance tumor-node-metastasis stage, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Noxin facilitated the expression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 through activating P38-activating transcription factor 2 signaling pathway, thus enhanced cell growth of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

DNA methylations play important roles in cancer development and progression. Formal concept analysis was previously utilized for data mining hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in breast cancer molecular subtypes in illumina methylation-based microarray database, to laboratory validate their outputs; HS3ST2 (heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfonyl transferase-2) and MUC1 (mucin-1) were retrieved. Both play important roles in progression and invasion of breast cancer. The methylation status of both genes was laboratory validated using methylation-based polymerase chain reaction in breast cancer subtypes luminal A (early stages) and luminal B (late stages) in comparison with benign conditions and normal breast to conclude their roles in tumor invasion and to validate the newly developed algorithm (formal concept analysis). Significant cancer-specific hypermethylation of HS3ST2 was detected in luminal B (chi square = 30.6, p = 0.000), while significant cancer-specific hypomethylation of MUC1 was detected in luminal B (chi square = 30.5, p = 0.001) breast cancer. The median levels of the percentage of methylated allele of both genes were significantly discriminative between luminal A and luminal B subtypes and benign and healthy control groups. Detection of MUC1 and HS3ST2 promoter methylation status appears to be useful molecular markers for assessing the progressive state of the disease and could be helpful in discriminating breast cancer molecular subtypes. These results validate the methylation-based microarray analysis, thus trust their output in the future.</AbstractText>\n"

Markers of tumor growth and invasion, cell death, immune activation, and angiogenesis can be assessed in parallel by a novel multiplex immunoassay panel. The diagnostic performance of a multiplex cancer biomarker magnetic bead panel comprising 24 tumor associated parameters was evaluated in sera of 154 women including 77 patients with breast cancer, 10 with precancerous lesions, 31 with benign breast diseases, and 36 healthy controls. Marker levels were log-transformed for variance stabilization. Significance testing was done using t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test with correction of p values for multiple testing. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed. Serum levels of several biomarkers were significantly (p ≤ 0.001) higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls, particularly alpha-fetoprotein, cancer antigen 15-3, cancer antigen 19-9, migration inhibitory factor, carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 125, hepatocyte growth factor, soluble Fas, tumor necrosis factor-α, stem cell factor, and osteopontin. As most markers were also elevated in benign breast diseases, only cancer antigen 15-3 showed significant differences to cancer patients (p ≤ 0.001). The resulting areas under the curve in receiver operating characteristic curves for discrimination between benign and malignant breast diseases achieved 0.71 with a sensitivity of 33.8% at 95% specificity. Multiplexing enables parallel analysis of different biomarker classes for cancer detection. Established cancer antigen 15-3 proved to be most relevant for differential diagnosis.</AbstractText>\n"

Methods We identified the spontaneous breast cancer mice by genotyping and characterized them into the early stage and the advanced stage groups according to their tumor size. Single cell suspension of the tumor tissues were obtained by mechanical methods and TAMs of different stages were sorted by flow cytometry. We measured the mRNA levels of M1 macrophages-related genes IL-1β, IL-27, IL-6, CD80, CD86 and M2 macrophages-related genes arginase 1 (Arg1), IL-10, interleukin 4 receptor α (IL-4Rα), macrophage mannose receptor 1 (Mrc1), chitinase-like 3 (Chil3/Ym1) by real-time quantitative PCR in order to analyze the phenotypic conversion of TAMs during the tumor progression. Results In the early stage, TAMs expressed high levels of M1-related genes, such as IL-1β, CD80, CD86. On the contrary, TAMs of advanced stage expressed high levels of M2-related genes, including Arg1, IL-10, IL-4Rα as well as IL-6.

The use of third-generation inhibitors represented by exemestane, letrozol and anastrozole is currently indicated. Anastrozole is a nonsteroidal compound and a potent selective inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme. Although a few studies have shown that its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties may be affected by interindividual variability, this drug has been recently used in all configurations of breast cancer treatment. In metastatic disease, it is currently considered the first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors. Anastrozole has shown promising results in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It has also achieved interesting results in the chemoprevention of the disease. Therefore, due to the importance of anastrozole both for endocrine treatment and chemoprevention of hormone-sensitive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, we proposed the current literature review in the SciELO and PubMed database of articles published in the last 10 years.</AbstractText>\n"

But, if different assessments are all relevant, the meaning of discordance requires explanation. As an example, for 1085 breast cancers, a low (score 1), intermediate (score 2) or high nuclear grade (NG) (score 3) was assigned in years 2013, 2015, 2016. Year apart readings allowed for memory lapse of prior readings. For each cancer, scores for NG2013, NG2015, NG2016 were added together to yield sum score nuclear grade (SSNG) with range 3 to 9. SSNG was used to find if discrepancy between NG readings carried information for patient outcome. Discrepancies were inherent with SSNG=4, 5, 7 or 8. Time-dependent receiver operator curves were central for evaluating discordance as related to patient outcome. Area under curves for SSNG, and the component NGs, in stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 cancers were, respectively: SSNG: 70, 68, 75; NG2013: 70, 63, 71; NG2015: 67, 65, 74; and NG2016: 65, 66, 68. The area under curves of SSNG was not significantly lower than any of the components from which it was derived. This is despite discordant readings having been incorporated into SSNG. Among the 3 readings, 50.1% were discordant, yet only 2.1% were low/high discrepancy. Concordance in high-grade assignment (SSNG=9) corresponded to poor prognosis. If morphologic features are midway between 2 predefined levels it is sensible that separate readings will be distributed between adjacent levels. Shown has been how an &quot;in-between&quot; level helps predict survival then discordance discovery offers classification. Discordance discovery can conceivably be embraced for real-world applications.</AbstractText>\n"

The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary tumor and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary tumor, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets <i>Git2</i> and <i>Cyth3</i>, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating tumor cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast tumors and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Recently, much importance has been given to tumor microenvironment (TME) in the development of invasive malignant tumors, as well as the metastasis potential. The ability of tumor cells to modulate TME and to escape immune-mediated attack by releasing immunosuppressive cytokines has become a hallmark of breast cancer. Our study shows the effect of IV formulation of HET0016 (HPßCD-HET0016) a selective inhibitor of 20-HETE synthesis, administered intravenously in immune-competent in vivo mouse model of murine breast cancer. 4T1 luciferase positive cells were implanted to the mammary fat pad in Balb/c mice. Treatment started on day 15, and was administered for 5 days a week for 3 weeks. The development of metastasis was detected via optical imaging. Blood, spleen, lungs, bone marrow and tumor were collected for flow cytometry, to investigate changes in myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) populations and endothelial phenotype. Tumor and lungs were collected for protein analysis. Our results show that HPßCD-HET0016: (1) decreased tumor volume and lung metastasis compared to the vehicle group; (2) reduced migration and invasion of tumor cells and levels of metalloproteinases in the lungs of animals treated with HPßCD-HET0016 via PI3K/AKT pathway; and (3) decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and granulocytic MDSCs population in the lung microenvironment in treated animals.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of its dysregulation in breast cancer and its involvement in cisplatin resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells. Data mining in Kaplan-Meier Plotter showed that high MASTL expression was associated with worse distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) and relapse free survival (RFS) in ER+ breast cancer patients. In TCGA breast cancer cohort (TCGA-BRCA), MASTL was strongly co-upregulated with E2F8. High E2F8 expression was also strongly associated with unfavorable DMFS and RFS in ER+ breast cancer patients. Promoter scanning in JASPAR Database showed that the MASTL promoter region has a highly possible E2F8 binding site upstream the TSS site. The following western blot, dual luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR validated this binding site. In MCF-7 cells, E2F8 overexpression alleviated cisplatin induced cell apoptosis by shortening G2/M arrest and promoting mitotic entry, the effect of which was largely canceled by inhibiting MASTL. Therefore, we infer that E2F8 can shorten cisplatin induced G2/M arrest by promoting MASTL mediated mitotic progression in ER+ breast cancer cells. These findings might help to explain why high MASTL or high E2F8 expression is associated with worse RFS in ER+ breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our previous studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the process of metastasis and in the migration of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BDNF on the tumor cell microenvironment, namely, the cancer cell-endothelial cell interaction of TNBC cells.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We conducted oligoneucleotide microarray analysis of potential biomarkers that are able to differentiate recurrent TNBC from non-recurrent TNBC. The MDA-MB-231 and human endothelial HUVEC lines were used for this study and our approaches included functional studies, such as migration assay, as well as Western blot and real-time PCR analysis of migration and angiogenic signaling. In addition, we analyzed the survival outcome of TNBC breast cancer patients according to their expression level of BDNF using clinical samples.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">The results demonstrated that BDNF was able to bring about autocrinal (MDA-MB-231) and paracrinal (HUVECs) regulation of BDNF-TrkB gene expression and this affected cell migratory activity. The BDNF-induced migratory activity was blocked by inhibitors of ERK, PI3K and TrkB when MDA-MB-231 cells were examined, but only an inhibitor of ERK blocked this activity when HUVEC cells were used. Furthermore, decreased migratory activity was found for △BDNF and △TrkB cell lines. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of MDA-MB-231 cells showed that BDNF is a key factor that is able to regulate a network made up of metalloproteases and calmodulin. Protein expression levels in a tissue array of tumor slices were found to be correlated with patient prognosis and the results showed that there was significant correlation of TrkB expression, but not of BDNF. expressionwith patient DFS and OS.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our study demonstrates that up-regulation of the BDNF signaling pathway seems tobe involved in the mechanism associated with early recurrence in triple negative breast cancer cell. In addition, BDNF can function in either an autocrine or a paracrine manner to increase the migration ability of both MDA-MB-231 cells and HUVEC cells. Finally, overexpression of TrkB, but not of BDNF, is significantly associated with a poor survival outcome for TNBC patients.</AbstractText>\n"

Lobular breast cancer lesions are often difficult to detect with conventional imaging because they tend to grow less cohesively than ductal cancer. These images represent 3 lobular breast cancer cases, in whom confirmation of metastatic disease would make the crucial difference between curative or noncurative treatment. Staging with conventional imaging, however, yielded equivocal results, and a biopsy was not feasible. In contrast, FES (16α-[F]fluoro-17β-estradiol) PET provided a decisive contribution to clinical decision making in these patients. This indicates that FES PET may have added value in relation to conventional staging.</AbstractText>\n"

Treatment plans are based on the biology of the tumour rather than the stage. Consequently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is commonly the primary therapy for early breast cancer as well as locally advanced disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard axillary management for women with node-negative disease. This review looks at the relevant literature and gives guidance on the timing of SLNB when NACT is planned and evaluates the safety of performing an SLNB rather than an axillary clearance.</AbstractText>\n"
"28603063","2017/06/13 06:00","Overexpression of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A predicts worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer: a 15-year follow-up.","<AbstractText>Breast cancer subtypes can be stratified by IHC expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). The signaling pathways mediated by these receptors are the dominant drivers of cell proliferation and survival in most human breast cancers. One of the most frequently overactivated pathways in breast cancer is the AKT signaling cascade. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) acts as a switch to turn off signal transduction in the AKT pathway; however, it is frequently inactivated in many cancers by phosphorylation of Tyr-307 to form phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (p-PP2A). This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of p-PP2A and phospho-AKT (p-AKT) expression in 672 patients with breast cancer during a 15-year follow-up. The breast tissue microarray was evaluated for p-PP2A and p-AKT expression using IHC staining and scores. Analysis of IHC staining results revealed that p-PP2A expression was positively correlated with HER2, Ki-67, and p-AKT overexpression (P&lt;.001, P=.003, and P=.001, respectively). At the time of diagnosis, breast cancer patients with higher p-PP2A expression had significantly shorter 15-year OS than patients with lower p-PP2A expression did (P=.017). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high p-PP2A expression was an independent prognostic factor for shorter OS (hazard ratio, 1.741; P=.012). Our data revealed that high p-PP2A expression is positively associated with HER2, Ki-67, and p-AKT expression. High p-PP2A expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer, especially in patients with TNBC.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

After this publication, a practice guideline made HT alone a standard treatment option in British Columbia. The subsequent population-based pattern of practice was studied.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS AND MATERIALS\">All women aged 70 to 79 years, referred after lumpectomy from 1999 to 2009, with stage 1, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were identified. The use of adjuvant HT or HT-RT was evaluated in 2 eras: before (1999-2003) and after (2005-2009) the CALGB publication. The proportion receiving each treatment in these eras was determined. Kaplan-Meier analyses with Cox regression were used for survival endpoints. The Fine and Gray method was used with non-breast cancer death as a competing risk for event-free survival. The Charlson score was used to quantify comorbidity. Adherence was defined as dispensation of 80% of prescribed HT.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">HT-RT was used in 91% of patients before (n=319) and 89% of patients after (n=403) the CALGB publication (P=.4). In the HT-alone group, the rate of HT adherence was 75% at 1 year and 55% at 4 years. The 10-year locoregional recurrence-free survival rate was 98% with HT-RT and 90% with HT alone (P=.01), whereas the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival rate was 96% with HT-RT and 95% with HT alone (P=.2). Patients with grade 3 histology or lymphovascular invasion were more likely to have low event-free survival. On multivariate analysis, treatment type did not predict overall survival (P=.3).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our patient outcomes closely matched those of the CALGB trial, suggesting that its results are generalizable to a population of elderly breast cancer patients with typical HT adherence. The CALGB trial results, as well as the resulting practice guideline, did not change the use of adjuvant HT-RT in our population-based cancer program.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Radiation therapy is a critical component of treatment for breast cancer patients. However, little is known about radiation response among these intrinsic subtypes. In previous studies, we identified a significant induction of FAS after irradiation in biologically favorable breast cancer patients and breast cancer cell lines. Here, we expanded our study and investigated radiation response in a mouse model of breast cancer. MCF7 (luminal), HCC1954 (HER2<sup>+</sup>) or SUM159 (basal) cells were implanted orthotopically into the dorsal mammary fat pad of nude mice. These mice were then treated with different doses of radiation to assess tumor growth control. We further investigated the therapeutic effect of FAS modulation by silencing FAS in radiation-responsive tumors and injecting FAS agonist antibody into radiation-resistant tumors. Exposure to radiation inhibited MCF7, and to a lesser extent HCC1954 tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, SUM159 tumors were resistant to radiation. The estimated TCD<sub>50</sub> values were 19.3 Gy for MCF7 and 44.9 Gy for SUM159. Radiation induced FAS expression in MCF7 tumors, but not SUM159 tumors. We found that silencing of FAS did not negatively impact radiation response in MCF7 tumors, possibly due to compensation by other apoptotic pathways. On the other hand, FAS activating antibody in combination with radiation treatment delayed SUM159 and HCC1954 tumor growth. However, it did not reach statistical significance compared to radiation treatment alone. Our results suggest that there is intrinsic variation in radiation response among breast cancer subtypes. FAS activation concurrent with radiation slows tumor growth in the radiation-resistant subtypes, but the effect was not significant. Alternative subtype-specific modulators of radiation response are under investigation.</AbstractText>\n"

Identification of these individuals allows for proper screening, management, and testing of at-risk relatives. NCCN has established clinical criteria for recommending <i>BRCA1/2</i> testing. <b>Patients and Methods:</b> A retrospective chart review of 1,123 patients with breast cancer was performed to evaluate the positive predictive values (PPVs) of 14 individual criteria for predicting <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations. <b>Results:</b> Two criteria had PPVs significantly below 10%. Only 2 of 115 patients who were recommended for testing based solely on the criterion of &quot;diagnosed with breast cancer at ≤45 years of age&quot; had pathogenic mutations at a PPV of 1.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-6.0%). Additionally, 0 of 37 individuals who underwent testing based on the criterion, &quot;diagnosed with breast cancer at any age with ≥2 close blood relatives with breast cancer at any age&quot; tested positive (95% CI, 0%-9%). Overall, meeting &gt;1 criterion has a PPV of 12%, whereas meeting only 1 criterion has a PPV of 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6%-5.7%), significantly below 10% (<i>P</i>&lt;.0001) for predicting <i>BRCA1/2</i> positivity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with breast cancer meeting &gt;1 criterion constitute a population significantly enriched for <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations, whereas those meeting only 1 criterion test positive at a rate similar to unselected patients with breast cancer.

Regardless, many asymptomatic patients undergo chest CT. The goal of this study was to assess the use and results of chest CT in these patients at an NCCN Member Institution. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with breast cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2012 were identified in a prospectively maintained database. All patients with clinical stage I/II disease who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included. Data collected included demographics, tumor size, node status, chest CT within 6 months of diagnosis, imaging findings, need for additional workup, and identification of metastatic disease. Appropriate statistical tests were used for analysis. <b>Results:</b> From 1998 to 2012, 3,321 patients were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Of these, 2,062 (62.1%) had clinical stage I breast cancer at diagnosis and 1,259 (37.9%) had stage II; 227 patients (11%) with stage I and 456 (36.2%) with stage II breast cancer received staging chest CT. Of patients undergoing CT, 184 (26.9%) were found to have pulmonary nodules, which measured ≤5 mm for 128 patients (69.6%), 5 to 10 mm for 46 patients (25.0%), 11 to 20 mm for 6 patients (3.2%), and ≥20 mm for 4 patients (2.2%). Patients undergoing chest CT for staging subsequently underwent a mean of 2.34 (range, 0-16) additional CTs in follow-up. Of all patients undergoing chest CT for staging, only 9 (1.3%) were ultimately diagnosed with pulmonary metastases at an average of 25 months (range, 0-97) after initial staging chest CT. <b>Conclusions:</b> A significant percentage of patients with stage I/II breast cancer underwent unnecessary chest CT as part of their initial workup. Nearly one-third of these patients were found to have pulmonary nodules, but only 1.3% were ever diagnosed with pulmonary metastases. Adherence to NCCN Guidelines will reduce the excessive use of CT chest imaging.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

We also examined whether associations between body size and race/ethnicity and pubertal milestones were modified by BCFH. We used mother/guardian reports as the primary measure of pubertal milestones, but also conducted sensitivity analyses using clinical Tanner measurements available for a subcohort (n = 204). We analyzed cross-sectional baseline data with logistic regression models for the entire cohort, and longitudinal data with Weibull survival models for the subcohort of girls that were aged 5-7 years at baseline (n = 258).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">BCFH was modestly, but not statistically significantly, associated with Breast T2+ (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88-2.10), with a stronger association seen in the subcohort of girls with clinical breast Tanner staging (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 0.91-5.32). In a longitudinal analysis of girls who were aged 5-7 years at baseline, BCFH was associated with a 50% increased rate of having early breast development (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.0-2.21). This association increased to twofold in girls who were not overweight at baseline (HR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.29-3.21). BCFH was not associated with pubic hair development and post-menarche status. The median interval between onset of breast development and menarche was longer for BCFH+ than BCFH- girls (2.3 versus 1.7 years), suggesting a slower developmental tempo for BCFH+ girls. Associations between pubertal milestones and body size and race/ethnicity were similar in girls with or without a BCFH. For example, weight was positively associated with Breast T2+ in both girls with (OR = 1.06 per 1 kg, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10) and without (OR = 1.14 per 1 kg, 95% CI = 1.04-1.24) a BCFH.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">These results suggest that BCFH may be related to earlier breast development and slower pubertal tempo independent of body size and race/ethnicity.</AbstractText>\n"

However, the roles of these components in BC development and progression remain controversial. This study examined whether serial serum lipid and lipoprotein measurements were associated with breast cancer risk and whether lipoproteins had BC prognostic properties. We compared the plasma-related parameter levels, including lipid and lipoprotein levels between 299 patients with invasive ductal breast cancer, also known as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and 200 healthy donors. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We found that the serum glucose, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly higher in patients with IDC than in healthy donors. However, high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) levels were lower in patients with IDC than in healthy donors. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that elevated apoA1 levels were associated with a reduced risk of IDC, and univariate analysis showed that patients with IDC with lower apoA1 levels at diagnosis had larger tumors than patients with high apoA1 levels. Moreover, patients with IDC with lower apoA1 levels were more likely to have positive axillary lymph nodes, and were diagnosed at more advanced disease stages than patients with high apoA1 levels. We used a Cox regression model to assess the relationships between the above parameters and DFS and OS, after adjusting for tumor T and N stages, which were determined using the TNM classification system, and immunohistochemical subtypes. We found that lower apoA1 levels at diagnosis were associated with poor DFS and OS. At 60 months of follow-up, the DFS rate is 74.5% in the apoA1 L1 group, 89.9% in apoA1 L2 group, and 93.1% in apoA1 L3 group (p=0.0002). Similarly, the OS rate is 78.2% in apoA1 L1 group, 91.3% in apoA1 L2 group, and 93.7% in apoA1 L3 group (p=0.0012). In conclusion, our data indicate that low apoA1 levels are an independent predictor of the poor clinical outcomes in IDC patients.</AbstractText>\n"

"28590426","2017/06/08 06:00","Down's Syndrome and Triple Negative Breast Cancer: A Rare Occurrence of Distinctive Clinical Relationship.","<AbstractText>Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of significant intellectual disability in children and adults is caused by the trisomy of either all or a part of human chromosome 21 (HSA21). Patients with DS mostly suffer from characteristic tumor types. Although individual patients of DS are at a higher risk for acute leukemia and testicular cancers, other types of solid tumors including breast cancers are mostly uncommon and have significantly lower-than-expected age-adjusted incidence rates. Except for an increased risk of retinoblastomas, and lymphomas, the risk of developing solid tumors has been found to be lower in both children and adults, and breast cancer was found to be almost absent (Hasle H., The Lancet Oncology, 2001). A study conducted in the United States found only one death when 11.65 were expected (Scholl T et al., Dev Med Child Neurol. 1982). A recent study examined mammogram reports of women with DS treated in the largest medical facility specifically serving adults with DS in the United States. It was found that only 0.7% women with DS had been diagnosed with breast cancers (Chicoine B et al., Intellect Dev Disabil. 2015). Here we describe a case of breast cancer in a 25-year-old patient with DS. The disease was presented as lymph node positive carcinoma with alterations of tumor suppressor genes characteristic to the triple negative breast cancer subtype. Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) revealed a wild-type status for <i>BRCA1</i>. The CGP report showed a frameshift mutation, A359fs*10 of the tumor suppressor gene <i>INPP4B</i> and another frameshift mutation, R282fs*63 of tumor suppressor gene <i>TP53</i> in the tumor biopsy as characteristically found in triple-negative breast cancers. The VUS (Variance of Unknown Significance) alteration(s) were identified in <i>ASXL1</i> (L1395V), <i>NTRK1</i> (G18E), <i>DDR2</i> (I159T), <i>RUNX1</i> (amplification), <i>ERG</i> (amplification), <i>SOX2</i> (T26A), <i>FAM123B</i> (G1031D), and <i>HNF1A</i> (A301T). Bonafide cancer-related genes of chromosome 21 amplified in the patient's tumor are <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>ERG</i> genes. After the completion of the radiation, the patient was placed on everolimus which was based on the result of her CGP report. Thus, post-mastectomy radiation therapy was completed with a recommendation for everolimus for one year. During the time of writing of this report, no metastatic lesions were identified. The patient currently has no evidence of disease.</AbstractText>\n"

Growing evidence has manifested the deregulation of PinX1 in distinct cancers. Nonetheless, the loss status of PinX1 and its diagnostic, prognostic and clinicopathological significance in Basal-like breast cancer are still unclear. In the present study, the PinX1 expression levels of breast cancer tissues were investigated by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting assays. Then immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect PinX1 expression on a tissue microarray. The optimal threshold for PinX1 positivity was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. To clarify the probable role of PinX1 in BLBC, the PinX1 knockout and stably over-expressed MDA-MB-231 cell lines were constructed by the CRISPR-Cas9 system and gene transfection. The association of PinX1 expression with cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells were observed by CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay, flow cytometric analysis and immunoblotting of the cleaved caspase-3 protein level. Our results showed that both PinX1 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in breast cancer tissues (P&lt;0.05). In IHC analysis, the optimal cut-off parameter for PinX1 positive expression was 62.5% (the AUC was 0.749, P&lt;0.01). PinX1 positivity was 76.9% (10/14) in luminal subtypes, 50% (5/10) in Her2-enriched breast cancer and 27.3% (9/33) in basal-like subtypes. Besides, in 59 invasive ductal breast carcinomas, PinX1 expression was inversely related to histology grade (P&lt;0.05) while it was positively associated with PR status (P&lt;0.05) and ER status (P&lt;0.05). These results indicated that low expression of PinX1 correlated with aggressive clinicopathological significance of breast cancer, especially in the basal-like subtype. Besides, we identified that overexpression of PinX1 inhibited the proliferation rates and migration ability and increased the apoptosis rates of BLBC. Our findings demonstrated that low expression of PinX1 was associated with malignant behaviors in basal-like subtype of breast cancer. PinX1 is likely a feasible biomarker and molecular target of BLBC.</AbstractText>\n"
"28585217","2017/06/07 06:00","Obesity-associated Breast Cancer: Analysis of risk factors.","<AbstractText>Several studies show that a significantly stronger association is obvious between increased body mass index (BMI) and higher breast cancer incidence. Furthermore, obese women are at higher risk of all-cause and breast cancer specific mortality when compared to non-obese women with breast cancer. In this context, increased levels of estrogens due to excessive aromatization activity of the adipose tissue, overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, hyperactivation of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) pathways, adipocyte-derived adipokines, hypercholesterolemia and excessive oxidative stress contribute to the development of breast cancer in obese women. While higher breast cancer risk with hormone replacement therapy is particularly evident among lean women, in postmenopausal women who are not taking exogenous hormones, general obesity is a significant predictor for breast cancer. Moreover, increased plasma cholesterol leads to accelerated tumor formation and exacerbates their aggressiveness. In contrast to postmenopausal women, premenopausal women with high BMI are inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, life-style of women for breast cancer risk is regulated by avoiding the overweight and a high-fat diet. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone therapy users for more than 5 years have elevated risks of both invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer. Additionally, these cases are more commonly node-positive and have a higher cancer-related mortality. Collectively, in this chapter, the impacts of obesity-related estrogen, cholesterol, saturated fatty acid, leptin and adiponectin concentrations, aromatase activity, leptin and insulin resistance on breast cancer patients are evaluated. Obesity-related prognostic factors of breast cancer also are discussed at molecular basis.</AbstractText>\n"

However, it is not known whether this applies to Japanese patients in daily clinical practice, because this conclusion was based on the results of older, western trials. Therefore, we studied the differences between PMRT results in western breast cancer patients and current practice in Japanese patients. Although we identified three differences, they do not appear to strongly impact the results of EBCTCG. We conclude that Japanese breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes should receive PMRT in daily clinical practice.</AbstractText>\n"

Recently, SEMA3B has emerged as a tumor suppressor in non-neuronal cells. Here, we show that SEMA3B is a direct target of GATA3 transcriptional activity. GATA3 is a key transcription factor that regulates genes involved in mammary luminal cell differentiation and tumor suppression. We show that GATA3 relies on SEMA3B for suppression of tumor growth. Loss of SEMA3B renders GATA3 inactive and promotes aggressive breast cancer development. Overexpression of SEMA3B in cells lacking GATA3 induces a GATA3-like phenotype and higher levels of SEMA3B are associated with better cancer patient prognosis. Moreover, SEMA3B interferes with activation of LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) to abrogate breast cancer progression. Our data provide new insights into the role of SEMA3B in mammary gland and provides a new branch of GATA3 signaling that is pivotal for inhibition of breast cancer progression and metastasis.</AbstractText>\n"

Patients were also evaluated for acute toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0), cosmesis (Harvard Scale), development of distant metastatic disease, and overall survival.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Between January 2011 and October 2015, 158 eligible patients underwent WHBI immediately following BCS. The median age was 60 years (range, 30-84 years), and the median follow-up period was 3 years. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence developed in a total of 2 patients (1.3%), 1 in conjunction with widespread metastatic disease. Distant metastatic disease developed in 4 patients (2.5%), and the 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 97.5% and 96.2%, respectively. The most common grade 1 or 2 acute toxicities were breast pain, radiation dermatitis, and fatigue. There were 2 grade 3 events (1.3%): pain requiring narcotic analgesics (1) and posttreatment infection requiring hospitalization (1). The rate of excellent or good cosmesis versus fair or poor cosmesis was 82.3% versus 17.7%. The rate of significant cosmetic change from baseline to last follow-up (dropping from excellent or good to fair or poor) was 11.6%.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Early outcomes after WHBI are favorable and parallel those seen with daily hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation.

Patients and Methods MONARCH 2 was a global, double-blind, phase III study of women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who had progressed while receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), ≤ 12 months from the end of adjuvant ET, or while receiving first-line ET for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily) on a continuous schedule and fulvestrant (500 mg, per label). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), and key secondary end points included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, quality of life, and safety. Results Between August 2014 and December 2015, 669 patients were randomly assigned to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (n = 446) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 223). Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant significantly extended PFS versus fulvestrant alone (median, 16.4 v 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.553; 95% CI, 0.449 to 0.681; P &lt; .001). In patients with measurable disease, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant achieved an ORR of 48.1% (95% CI, 42.6% to 53.6%) compared with 21.3% (95% CI, 15.1% to 27.6%) in the control arm.

HER2 is highly expressed in breast cancer and is a target for cancer therapy and prevention. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor activity of the combination of an HER2 inhibitor, trastuzumab with an EGFR-inhibitor, nimotuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Our data showed that a greater anti-tumor activity from the combination of trastuzumab and nimotuzumab than any alone usage of above antibody both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the combination index value, our data demonstrated that nimotuzumab synergistically enhanced trastuzumab-induced cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, we investigated the possible mechanism of this synergistic efficacy induced by trastuzumab plus nimotuzumab. Data showed that the combination was more potent in reducing the phosphorylation of HER2 and ERK1/2. We also found that the synergistic inhibition was partly attributed to the ROS generation and repression of NRF2 pathway that is known to promote cell growth. These results support the clinical development of this two-drug regimen for the treatment of HER2-amplified breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

One hundred three physicians were asked to complete an online survey aiming to understand their satisfaction and expectations with current available treatments and potential areas of unmet need for mBC patients. Medical records from 178 females were extracted for the chart review. Using these data from medical records, patient characteristics and treatment patterns were analyzed descriptively. Time to progression (TTP) on first line, and progression-free survival (PFS) on second and third line of therapy were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Sixty-seven percent (n = 119) of patients had metastatic disease at initial diagnosis of breast cancer.

As an example, for early stage disease, there has been active investigation of partial breast irradiation (PBI) vs whole breast irradiation. Although still investigational, PBI reduces the treatment volumes, doses to organs at risk, and may improve cosmesis. Over the past 2 decades PBI has been delivered via interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraoperative radiation therapy, or 3-dimensional external beam radiation therapy. More recently, there has been growing evidence that supports stereotactic body radiation therapy as a safe and effective new treatment for early stage breast cancer.

Here, we examine the impact of ERβ on the ERα-p53 loop in breast cancer. We found that ERβ attenuates ERα-induced cell proliferation, increases apoptosis, and reverses transcriptional activation and repression by ERα. Further, ERβ physically interacts with p53, reduces ERα-p53 binding, and antagonizes ERα-p53-mediated transcriptional regulation. ERα directs SUV39H1/H2 and histone H3 lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) heterochromatin assembly at estrogen-repressed genes to silence p53-activated transcription. The copresence of ERβ in ERα-positive cells abrogates the H3K9me3 repressive heterochromatin conformation by downregulating SUV39H1 and SUV39H2, thereby releasing the ERα-induced transcriptional block. Furthermore, the presence of ERβ stimulates accumulation of histone H3 lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) on ERα-repressed genes, inducing H3K4me3-associated epigenetic activation of the transcription of these repressed genes that can promote p53-based tumor suppression. ERβ also reduced corepressor N-CoR and SMRT recruitment by ERα that could attenuate the crosstalk between ERα and p53. Overall, our data reveal a novel mechanism for ERβ's anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells involving p53 and epigenetic changes in histone methylation that underlie gene regulation of these cellular activities.</AbstractText>\n"

In the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study, 3,088 women diagnosed of breast cancer were enrolled and assessed. After 4 years, a subgroup of 2,131 women was re-assessed for the pain information. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of baseline BMI and BMI change between baseline and 4 years of follow-up with general pain symptoms at 4 years of follow-up. We further synthesized all available evidence from observational studies by searching PubMed and Embase up to February 2017. In the WHEL study, baseline BMI was linearly associated with an increased risk of persistent pain at 4 years of follow-up (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.07 (1.05-1.10)). After adjusting for baseline BMI, BMI change since baseline was associated with persistent pain (OR (95% CI) for every unit increase: 1.10 (1.04-1.16)). After searching the literature, additional eight studies were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. After pooling estimates from all nine studies, there was a positive association with persistent pain development comparing obesity or overweight with normal weight. Available data suggested a linear relationship between BMI and persistent pain (OR (95% CI) for every one unit increment of BMI: 1.04 (1.02-1.07)).

Although recent studies have focused on CD68-positive or CD163-positive TAM in breast cancer, no study has investigated the significance of CD204-positive TAM in breast cancer. We found that CD204 expression on macrophages was evaluated following stimulation with the conditioned medium (CM) of breast cancer cell lines. Paraffin sections of 149 breast cancer samples which were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma were immunohistochemically analyzed for CD68, CD163 and CD204 expression. The results of analyses indicated that a high number of CD204-positive TAM was associated with worse clinical prognoses, including relapse-free survival, distant relapse-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival; however, neither the numbers of CD68-positive or CD163-positive TAM were associated with clinical courses. Of the clinicopathological factors investigated, estrogen receptor, Ki-67 index, hormone subtype, and histological grade were significantly related to the increased number of CD163-positive and CD204-positive TAM. These data indicate the clinical significance of CD204-positive TAM in breast cancer progression and CD204 is a marker for predicting clinical prognosis in breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors.

The principal obstacle for successful BC treatment is the acquired or de novo resistance of the tumors to the systemic therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine, and targeted therapies) that patients receive. In the era of personalized treatment, several studies have focused on the search for biomarkers capable of predicting the response to this therapy; microRNAs (miRNAs) stand out among these markers due to their broad spectrum or potential clinical applications. miRNAs are conserved small non-coding RNAs that act as negative regulators of gene expression playing an important role in several cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, autophagy, genomic stability, and apoptosis. We reviewed recent data that describe the role of miRNAs as potential predictors of response to systemic treatments in BC. Furthermore, upon analyzing the collected published information, we noticed that the overexpression of miR-155, miR-222, miR-125b, and miR-21 predicts the resistance to the most common systemic treatments; nonetheless, the function of these particular miRNAs must be carefully studied and further analyses are still necessary to increase knowledge about their role and future potential clinical uses in BC.</AbstractText>\n"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of HER-2 Subclonal Amplification in a retrospective series of breast cancers. Accordingly, 81 consecutive breast carcinomas showing HER-2 Subclonal Amplification were obtained from the histology files (case series). These cases were subdivided into two groups: (a) those cases in which the HER-2 Subclonal Amplification was consonant to the accepted criteria for amplification, showing clusters of amplified cells, and (b) those cases with rare HER-2 Subclonal Amplification that did not reflect the accepted criteria for amplification, showing scattered amplified cells only. The incidence of metastases and late recurrences of the case series was compared with a series composed of 109 consecutive cases, being HER-2 homogeneous (comprising 14 Amplified and 95 Non-Amplified cases), matched for grade and stage (control series). It appeared that cases showing Subclonal Amplification had an incidence of metastases intermediate between the cases Amplified and Non-Amplified. Specifically, Subclonal Amplification with clustered cells had a lower incidence of metastases than Amplified cases (12.9 versus 21.4%). On the contrary, Subclonal Amplification with scattered cells showed an incidence of metastases higher than Non-Amplified cases (14 versus 9.47%). In addition, patients Subclonal Amplification with clustered cells, who were treated with the specific monoclonal antibody, had a lower incidence of metastases than patients showing Subclonal Amplification with scattered cells, who did not receive target therapy. These data, together with those recently published, indicate that Subclonal Amplification has an impact on prognosis and should be taken into consideration to correctly plan the treatment of breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"

In younger women, future study should focus on the biological underpinnings of aggressive disease and optimizing adherence and treatment decision making while addressing their unique survivorship needs. The latter includes generating a scientific basis for interruption of therapy for pregnancy.

Luciferase activity analysis was performed to validate Wave-3 as a novel target of miR-7.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">miR-7 expression was negatively correlated with the stage, grade and survival of the breast cancer patients. There was also differential expression of miRNAs including miR-7 in the breast cancer cells. The synthesised mimic of miR-7 inhibits the motility and wound healing potential of breast cancer cells. The highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells are more sensitive to the miR-7 treatment than the poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. Treatment with miR-7 downregulated the expression of EGFR, IGF1R and Wave3 in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. In addition, we further demonstrated that miR-7 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of endothelial cells.

This subtype often has early and high recurrence rates, resulting in poor survival, partially due to lack of targeted therapies. To date, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC progression are unclear. Given the crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer metastasis, we aimed to analyse the expression and function of a metastasis-associated miRNA named miR-211-5p in TNBC.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">MiRNA array analysis was performed to search for metastasis-associated miRNAs in TNBC. The miR-211-5p expression in tumour tissues, adjacent non-tumourous breast tissues of TNBC patients and cell lines were evaluated by real-time PCR. The protein expression levels were analysed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation. Luciferase reporter assays were employed to validate the target of miR-211-5p.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Colony-forming assays were performed to detect differences in radiosensitivities in breast cancer cell lines. Gene transfection technology was used to introduce the expression of ERα in TNBC cells to compare the difference in radiosensitivity between the TNBC cells and ERα transfected cells. CCK-8 assays were used to observe changes in the proliferation of TNBC cells after ERα transfection. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the number of γH2AX foci in nuclei. Flow cytometry was used to detect changes in cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Western blotting was used to detect changes in autophagy-associated proteins. RESULTS The radioresistance of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 (231 cells) was greater than that of ERα-positive luminal-type breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Moreover, 231 cell proliferation and radioresistance decreased after ERα transfection. Interestingly, ERα-transfected 231 cells showed increased double-stranded breaks and delayed repair compared with 231 cells, and ERα-transfected 231 cells showed increased G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis after irradiation compared with those in 231 cells. ERα transfection in 231 cells reduced autophagy-related protein expression, suggesting that autophagy activity decreased in 231 ER-positive cells after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS TNBC cells were more resistant to radiation than luminal-type breast cancer cells. ERα expression may have major roles in modulating breast cancer cell radiosensitivity.</AbstractText>\n"

When patients were classified according to the numbers and locations of enlarged lymph nodes on pretreatment CT, the number of lymph nodes larger than 1 cm was most significantly associated with tumor recurrence. The accuracy of the CT-based nodal staging system was validated in an independent cohort of 132 patients. The presence of the enlarged supraclavicular nodes was associated with worse outcome, but the effect seemed to originate from the accompanied extensive axillary nodal burden.

In this population-based case-control study, we evaluated the association between alcohol consumption and risk of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and invasive ductal-lobular carcinoma (IDLC) overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) status, among women aged 55-74 years of age. Using polytomous regression, associations between current alcohol consumption, overall and by type of alcohol, and breast cancer risk were evaluated in 891 controls and 905 IDC, 567 ILC, and 489 IDLC cases. Current alcohol use was moderately associated with risk of ILC (odds ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.99, 1.58) with a positive dose-response relationship based on average number of drinks per week consumed (P <sub>trend</sub> = 0.0005). When further stratified by ER status, alcohol use was positively associated with risk of ER+ ILC (P <sub>trend</sub> = 0.002) and ER+ IDC (P <sub>trend</sub> = 0.02), but inversely associated with risk of ER-IDC (P <sub>trend</sub> = 0.01). No association between alcohol and risk of IDLC tumors was observed. While the link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk is well established, our results suggest that the increased risk associated with alcohol is largely limited to ER+ ILC and ER+ IDC. Thus, avoiding or moderating alcohol consumption may be one way that women can lower their risks of these forms of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Female patients diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer between 1999 and 2014 were included (N = 223). Univariate and multivariate analysis assessed the association between surgery and OS.One hundred seventy-seven (79.4%) underwent surgery for the primary tumor, and 46 (20.6%) had no surgery. No significant differences were observed in age at diagnosis, T-stage, N-stage, histological grade, molecular subtype, hormone receptor (HR), and number of metastatic sites between 2 groups. Patients in the surgery group had dramatically longer OS (45.6 vs 21.3 months, log-rank P &lt; .001).

These advances have resulted in the development of prognostic and predictive tools for use in clinical settings, which can assist clinicians and patients in making informed decisions about the benefits of established therapies. In early-stage breast cancer, multiparameter genomic assays are now available for decision making about the duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Similarly, in metastatic disease, there are multiple commercially available next-generation sequencing options for identifying genetic alterations in tumors that may be targeted with a drug. Although these tools hold great promise for providing precision medicine, it can be difficult for the treating physician to evaluate their clinical utility and appropriately select tools for individual clinical situations. This review summarizes the currently available genomic tools in breast cancer, the data underlying their clinical validity and utility, and how they can be used in conjunction with standard clinicopathologic data for making adjuvant and metastatic treatment decisions.</AbstractText>\n"

Because of stage migration and improvements in systemic therapy and other aspects of breast cancer care, the absolute benefit of PMRT and regional nodal irradiation may be small in some favorable subsets of patients with very low nodal burden, and newer consensus guidelines do not mandate PMRT in all node-positive cases. The use and need for PMRT may considerably complicate breast reconstruction after mastectomy and therefore mandates multidisciplinary input that takes into account patient choice given potential risk of acute and long-term toxicities, benefits, life expectancy, the biology of the tumor, plans for systemic therapy, and actual tumor burden. Management of axillary lymph node metastases is changing with selective use of axillary lymph node dissection for advanced disease, sentinel lymph node biopsy alone for clinically and pathologic node-negative cases receiving mastectomy, and targeted axillary dissection alone among patients with eradication of initial biopsy-proven nodal metastases with neoadjuvant systemic therapy use. In general, when the need for PMRT is anticipated, autologous reconstruction should be delayed. This comprehensive article reviews the current indications and implications regarding integration of breast cancer surgery and timing of reconstruction with optimum radiation delivery to achieve the best possible patient outcomes.</AbstractText>\n"

Assessments of standard clinical and pathological features have traditionally been used to determine the use of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with early stage breast cancer; however, the ability to identify those who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy remains a challenge, leading to the overtreatment of some patients. Advances in molecular medicine have substantially improved the accuracy of gene-expression profiling of breast tumours, resulting in improvements in the ability to predict a patient's risk of breast cancer recurrence and likely response to endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy. These genomic assays, several of which are commercially available, have aided physicians in tailoring treatment decisions for patients at the individual level.

In the present study, we showed that the synergism between mesupron and auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, for inducing of apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that mesupron and auranofin significantly lead to inhibition of the cancer cells proliferation; cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, and apoptosis as indicated by caspase 3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and annexin V staining. Isobologram analyses of MCF-7 cells showed a clear synergism between mesupron and auranofin. This combined treatment decreased the levels of mitochondrial anti-apoptotic factors, such as BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1 and caused nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ <sub>m</sub> ) was found to be strongly disrupted in combination-treated cells. In addition, combination treatment significantly enhanced the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which was rescued by N-acetylcysteine treatment. The combination treatment suppressed phosphorylation of Akt, thus contributing to apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that the use of mesupron in combination with auranofin may be important in achieving high anticancer synergy.</AbstractText>\n"

The necrosis becomes usually apparent a few days or weeks after the surgery and is often coincidental with the dehiscence of sternotomy with necrosis of wound edges. As it mostly affects the skin, it can be easily recognized. Also, our patient developed a dehisced sternotomy shortly after the surgery but there were no obvious objective changes on the breast. The condition was first dominated only by non-specific subjective symptom-pain. Later, a lump in the breast occurred, when the sternotomy had already healed. Moreover, an enlarged lymph node was palpable in the axilla. Because of non-typical symptoms, the condition was suggestive of breast cancer for a relatively long time.

It is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of tumor progression and cell proliferation. In this study, the role of Dyrk1B in breast cancer development was investigated. The expression of Dyrk1B was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining, both of which demonstrated that Dyrk1B was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cells. Statistical analysis showed that the extent of Dyrk1B expression was associated with multiple clinicopathologic factors, including tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status, and Ki-67 expression, and that high expression predicted a poor prognosis. The growth of breast cancer cells was inhibited significantly after knockout of DYRK1B by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Moreover, FoxO1 could be phosphorylated by Dyrk1B, and then FoxO1 was shuttled from the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm, which might be the mechanism of Dyrk1B-mediated survival in breast cancer cells. The results suggest that Dyrk1B plays a key role in the progression of breast cancer and provides a new target for breast cancer therapy.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

However, the mechanisms driving cancer-induced bone pain are poorly known. Recent studies show that a novel protease, asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) plays crucial roles in breast cancer metastasis and progression. We aim to determine the functions and targeted suppress of AEP in a mouse model of breast cancer-induced bone pain. Methods Breast cancer cells with AEP knocked-down or overexpression were constructed and implanted into the intramedullary space of the femur to induce pain-like behavior in mice. AEP-specific inhibitors or purified AEP proteins were further used in animal model. The histological characters of femur and pain ethological changes were measured. The expressions of AEP and neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR and TrkA) in dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord were examined. Results Femur radiographs and histological analysis revealed that cells with AEP knocked-down reduced bone destruction and pain behaviors. However, cells with AEP overexpression elevated bone damage and pain behaviors. Further, Western blot results found that the expressions of p75NTR and TrkA in dorsal root ganglions and spinal cords were reduced in mice inoculated with AEP knocked-down cells. Targeted suppression of AEP with specific small compounds significantly reduced the bone pain while purified recombinant AEP proteins increased bone pain. Conclusions AEP aggravate the development of breast cancer bone metastasis and bone pain by increasing the expression of neurotrophin receptors. AEP might be an effective target for treatment of breast cancerinduced bone pain.</AbstractText>\n"

In the last decade the antibody fragment indicated as nanobody (VHH or single domain antibody) has found its way to different applications previously done with conventional antibodies. Nanobodies can be selected to bind with high affinity and specificity to different antigens. They are small (molecular weight ca. 15kDa) and are usually easy to produce in microorganisms. Here we have evaluated the feasibility of a nanobody binding to HER2 for application in immuno-electron microscopy. To obtain highest labeling efficiency combined with optimal specificity, different labeling conditions were analysed, which included nanobody concentration, fixation and blocking conditions. The obtained optimal protocol was applied for post-embedment labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections and for pre-embedment labeling of HER2 for fluorescence microscopy and both transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We show that formaldehyde fixation after incubation with the anti-HER2 nanobody, improves labeling intensity. Among all tested blocking agents the best results were obtained with a mixture of cold water fish gelatine and acetylated bovine serum albumin, which prevented a-specific interactions causing background labeling while preserving specific interactions at the same time. In conclusion, we have developed a nanobody-based protocol for immuno-gold labeling of HER2 for Tokuyasu cryosections in TEM as well as for pre-embedment gold labeling of cells for both TEM and SEM.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

Macrophages within the tumour microenvironment are linked to the presence of LVI and angiogenesis. This study investigates the role of macrophage-derived, caspase-1-dependent interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in an in vitro model of LVI. IL-1β significantly augmented the adhesion and transmigration of breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 across endothelial cell barriers. MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 showed a higher percentage of adhesion to lymphatic endothelial cells than blood endothelial cells following endothelial cell IL-1β stimulation (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Supernatants from activated macrophages increased the adhesion of tumour cells to lymphatic and blood endothelium. Secretion of IL-1β was caspase-1 dependent, and treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor reduced IL-1β production by 73% and concomitantly reduced tumour cell adhesion to levels obtained with resting macrophages. Transmigration of MDA-MB-231 cells across blood and lymphatic endothelial monolayers was significantly increased following IL-1β stimulation. Furthermore, supernatants from activated macrophages increased transmigration of MDA-MB-231 cells across endothelial monolayers, which was abolished by caspase-1 inhibition. IL-1β stimulation of tumour cells significantly increased their migratory ability and a significant increase in migration was observed when MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with macrophage conditioned media (two of three donors). Results demonstrate that macrophage production of IL-1β plays an important role in the migration of breast cancer cells and their adhesion to, and transmigration across, blood and lymphatic endothelial cells. Results suggest that IL-1β may play a role in the adhesion to lymphatic endothelial cells in particular.</AbstractText>\n"

We investigated variation in the length of the patient interval (time from symptom onset to presentation) and the primary care interval (time from presentation to specialist referral) across symptom groups using descriptive analyses and quantile regression.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">A total of 56 presenting symptoms were described: breast lump was the most frequent (83%) followed by non-lump breast symptoms, (e.g. nipple abnormalities (7%) and breast pain (6%)); and non-breast symptoms (e.g. back pain (1%) and weight loss (0.3%)). Greater proportions of women with 'non-lump only' and 'both lump and non-lump' symptoms waited 90days or longer before seeking help compared to those with 'breast lump only' (15% and 20% vs. 7% respectively).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the level of tumor lymphocyte infiltration and well-known clinicopathological factors in breast cancer patients. We also evaluated the influence of TILs on overall survival. Paraffin sections were retrospectively evaluated in 76 cases in early stage breast cancer patients who underwent surgery followed by systemic treatment. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were classified as absent (grade 0), mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), or severe (grade 3). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were found in 87% of patients (severe grade in 8% of them). Higher grade (grades 2-3) TILs were present more frequently in younger patients (under 65 years) than older women (47% vs. 24%; p = 0.099). Higher grades of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (grades 2-3) appear to be associated with clinicopathological factors such as negative steroid receptor status (p = 0.001), HER2 overexpression (p = 0.016) and higher histological grade (G3) (p = 0.095). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were not a significant prognostic factor for overall survival in our group. Only HER2 overexpression significantly increases the risk of death (HR = 4.3, p = 0.020).

The goal of this work was to assess the prevalence of all biological types of breast cancer in the population of Kuyavian-Pomeranian province. We determined the influence of particular types of neoplasms on the degree of disease progression and the choice of therapeutic management. The study was conducted on a group of 2653 patients treated surgically due to malignant breast tumors in the Oncology Centre in Bydgoszcz. In the analyzed clinical material we determined the biological type of cancer as well as other prognostic factors. The most commonly identified types of cancer were luminal B1 type (38.4%) and luminal A type (27.4% of cases), followed by a triple-negative type, luminal B2 type and HER2-positive type (respectively: 11.4%, 10.2%, and 6.9% of patients). Estrogen receptors were present in 81.1% and progesterone receptors in 71.4% of subjects. HER2 overexpression was identified in 17.3% of patients. Routine use of a biology-based division into cancer types influences the choice of anti-cancer treatment. Diagnosis of luminal A type of tumor more commonly than other biological types of cancer coexists with lower clinical and pathological disease staging. It allows for more frequent use of sparing surgical techniques in patients. It also makes systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy unnecessary in the majority of patients (differences in such cases exhibit statistical significance of p &lt; 0.0001).</AbstractText>\n"

The importance of diverse natural and dietary agents to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer is well established. Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid found in many medicinal plants is widely used in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine. Because of its capability to seize the cell cycle and induce apoptosis of numerous malignant cells, berberine has received considerable attention as a potential anticancer agent. In the present study, breast cancer was induced in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by intragastric administration of 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) at a dose of 80mg/kg of body weight. Treatment of berberine (50mg/kg BW) to breast tumor bearing rats was found to be effective against DMBA induced mammary carcinoma. The increased levels of lipid peroxide (malonaldehyde), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), enzymatic antioxidants (SOD and CAT), non-enzymatic antioxidants (GSH and vitamin C) and transcription factor NF-κB were decreased significantly by administration of berberine. Furthermore, RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed the down-regulation of NF-κB and PCNA in breast tumors. Histopathological studies validated that berberine is effective against DMBA induced ductal carcinoma &amp; invasive carcinoma. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the preventive role of berberine against DMBA induced mammary carcinoma in SD rats.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We detected seven and three probes/genes associated with the postoperative OS and DFS, respectively, from our discovery cohort data. By incorporating these genes associated with the postoperative survival into MammaPrint genes, often used to predict prognosis of patients with early-stage breast cancer, we constructed postoperative OS and DFS prediction models from the discovery cohort data using a Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated in another independent cohort using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The KM curves showed a statistically significant difference between the predicted high- and low-risk groups in both OS (log-rank trend test P = 0.0033) and DFS (log-rank trend test P = 0.00030).

This systematic review provides an overview of the evidence from RCTs on the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening with mammography in women aged 40-49 years. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was appraised using the GRADE approach. Four articles reporting on two different trials-the Age trial and the Canadian National Breast Screening Study-I (CNBSS-I)-were included. The results showed no significant effect on breast cancer mortality (Age trial: RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.80-1.09); CNBSS-I: HR 1.10 (95% CI 0.86-1.40)) nor on all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.03) in women aged 40-49 years offered screening. Among regularly attending women, the cumulative risk of experiencing a false-positive recall was 20.5%. Over-diagnosis of invasive breast cancer at 5 years post-cessation of screening for women aged 40-49 years was estimated to be 32% and at 20 years post-cessation of screening to be 48%. Including ductal carcinoma in situ, these numbers were 41% and 55%. Based on the current evidence from randomised trials, extending mammography screening to younger age groups cannot be recommended. However, there were limitations including relatively low sensitivity of screening and screening attendance, insufficient power, and contamination, which may explain the nonsignificant results.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

Of the 93 women for whom stage was documented, 45 (48.4%) were diagnosed with early-stage disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage 0, I, or II), and 48 (51.6%) were diagnosed with late-stage disease (AJCC stage III or IV). Mean (SD) total delay from symptom onset to initiation of treatment was 407 (665) days because of patient (mean [SD], 198 [449] days) and health care system (mean [SD], 241 [556] days) delay. Fifty-two women (46.0%) had a history of clinical breast examination, and 23 (20.4%) had undergone previous mammography. Women who underwent a previous clinical breast examination were more likely to have shorter delays from symptom development to presentation compared with women who had never undergone a previous clinical breast examination (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.30-6.60; P = .01). Women diagnosed with shorter patient delay were more likely to be diagnosed with early-stage disease (AJCC stage 0, I, or II) than those with longer patient delay (31 [58.5%] vs 11 [30.6%], P = .01). Women who underwent a previous clinical breast examination were more likely to be diagnosed with early-stage disease compared with women who had never undergone previous clinical breast examination; this relationship remained significant after controlling for insurance and household income (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.01-5.95; P = .048).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"Conclusions and Relevance\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">In a population in which most breast cancers are self-detected, previous clinical breast examination was associated with shorter patient delay and earlier stage at breast cancer diagnosis. In regions of the world that lack mammographic screening, the routine use of clinical breast examination may provide a resource-appropriate strategy for improving breast cancer early diagnosis.</AbstractText>\n"

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of invasive/metastatic disease with obesity are complex, but may include elevated levels of adipokines such as leptin. Using physiological levels of leptin found in obesity in a novel chronic in vitro treatment model (≤200 ng/ml for 14 days), we confirmed the occurrence of leptin-mediated changes in growth, apoptosis and metastatic behavior, and gene expression changes representing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a cancer stem cell (CSC) like phenotype in breast epithelial and cancer cell lines (MCF10A, MCF10AT1, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). Further, we have discovered that these effects were accompanied by increased expression of TGFB1, and could be significantly reduced by co-treatment with neutralizing antibody against TGFB1, indicating that the induction of these characteristics was mediated via TGFB1. Occurring in both MCF7 and MCF10AT1 cells, it suggests these actions of leptin to be independent of estrogen receptor status. By linking leptin signalling to the established TGFB1 pathway of metastasis / EMT, this study gives a direct mechanism by which leptin can contribute to the poorer outcomes of obese cancer patients. Inhibitors of TGFB1 are in currently in phase III clinical trials in other malignancies, thus identifying the connection between leptin and TGFB1 will open new therapeutic opportunities for improving outcomes for obese breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"

Its expression has been associated with the progression of lung cancer, glioblastoma, and neuroblastoma as well as glucose induced apoptosis in pancreatic cells. We performed a retrospective study of 148 breast cancer specimens for NNAT expression by immunohistochemistry to evaluate this protein as a prognostic marker for breast cancer. We found a high NNAT immunoreactivity score (by multivariate cox regression) to be an independent prognostic marker for relapse-free (hazard ratio HR = 3.55, p = 0.002) and overall survival (HR = 6.29, p &lt; 0.001). However, NNAT expression was not associated with classical parameters such as hormone receptor expression (p = 0.86) or lymph node metastasis (p = 0.83). Additional independent risk factors in this study population were tumor size (≤2 cm; overall survival: HR = 0.36, p = 0.023; relapse-free survival: HR = 0.26, p &lt; 0.01) and blood vessel infiltration (overall survival: HR = 0.34 p &lt; 0.01).

An automated image postprocessing procedure was developed to simultaneously (1) contour the external volume of the arm and the muscle fascia, allowing separation of the epifacial and subfascial volumes; and to (2) separate the voxels belonging to the muscle, fat, and fluid components. The total, subfascial, epifascial, muscle (subfascial), fluid (epifascial), and fat (epifascial) volumes were measured in 13 patients with unilateral BCRL. Affected versus unaffected volumes were compared using a 2-tailed paired t test; a value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant. Pearson correlation was used to investigate the linear relationship between fat and fluid excess volumes. The distribution of fluid, fat, and epifascial excess volumes (affected minus unaffected) along the arm was also evaluated using dedicated tissue composition maps.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Total arm, epifascial, epifascial fluid, and epifascial fat volumes were significantly different (P &lt; 0.0005), with greater volume in the affected arms. The increase in epifascial volume (globally, 94% of the excess volume) constituted the bulk of the lymphoedematous swelling, with fat comprising the main component. The total fat excess volume summed over all patients was 2.1 times that of fluid. Furthermore, fat and fluid excess volumes were linearly correlated (Pearson r = 0.75), with the fat excess volume being greater than the fluid in 11 subjects. Differences in muscle compartment volume between affected and unaffected arms were not statistically significant, and contributed only 6% to the total excess volume. Considering the distribution of the different tissue excess volumes, fluid accumulated prevalently around the elbow, with substantial involvement of the upper arm in only 3 cases. Fat excess volume was generally greater in the upper arm; however, the relative increase in epifascial volume, which considers the total swelling relative to the original size of the arm, was in 9 cases maximal within the forearm.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our measurements indicate that excess of fat within the epifascial layer was the main contributor to the swelling, even when a substantial accumulation of fluid was present. The proposed approach could be used to monitor how the internal components of BCRL evolve after presentation, to stratify patients for treatment, and to objectively assess treatment response. This methodology provides quantitative metrics not currently available during the standard clinical assessment of BCRL and shows potential for implementation in clinical practice.</AbstractText>\n"

Development of BC is a multistep process, arising from genetic changes such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). In this study, we investigated HPV genotypes associated with BCs and its relation with MTHFR C677T polymorphism for early detection of familial BCs. A total of 84 archival BC samples from Iran were collected. Verification of each cancer reported in a relative was sought through the pathology reports of the hospital records. Then, DNA was extracted from all samples by standard methods and HPV genotypes and MTHFR C677T polymorphism genotypes were analyzed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR. Finally, data analysis was performed using version 7 of the Epi Info™ 2012 software and test chi-square (x2) for trend. The frequencies of the CC, TC, and TT genotypes of MTHFR (C677T) were 0.53, 0.38, and 0.09 in familial BC patients, and 0.46, 0.51, and 0.03, respectively, in nonfamilial BC patients. Furthermore, HPV DNA typing identified 29 infections and C677T TT genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of familial BC in the study population. Our results demonstrate that infection with HPV was prevalent among Iranian women with familial BC. Finally, the testing of C677T GG genotype in combination with HPV genotyping as molecular markers can be helpful in the early diagnosis of Iranian familial BCs by PCR.</AbstractText>\n"

Although such roles have been assessed in tumor pathogenesis, the correlation of its expression to the proliferating/apoptotic index has not been studied yet. Immunohistochemical staining of calpain-1 was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues to correlate its expression with clinicopathological variables and outcome. The proliferation activity was determined by calculating the percentage of cells expressing the Ki-67 antigen. The apoptotic index was assessed morphologically and biochemically using Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin method and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, respectively. Calpain-1 was significantly expressed in TNBC tissues varying from low to high with a significant correlation to lymph node status but not with the other clinicopathological variables, suggesting its role as a prognostic factor. In addition, a positive correlation was found between both apoptotic counts assays (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>r</i> = 0.547) as well as with proliferation (<i>P</i> = 0.045). Calpain-1 expression had no significant correlation with either proliferation (<i>P</i> = 0.29) or apoptotic indices (<i>P</i> = 0.071 and <i>P</i> = 0.100). Determining calpain-1 expression may provide relevant prognostic value for TNBC cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"

A thorough examination revealed high breast cancer-related tumor marker values, and based on a computed tomography(CT)examination, a tentative diagnosis of multiple lung, liver, retroperitoneal, and abdominal wall metastases was made. Although there were multiple organ metastases, in view of the long interval before the recurrence, absence of any symptoms, and the patient's age, we initiated treatment by weekly administration of an aromatase inhibitor and trastuzumab. The treatment was effective; the multiple metastases regressed, and the tumor marker levels decreased. One year after the start of treatment, the patient had a rebound in the tumor marker levels, and an increase in the size of the liver metastases was observed in diagnostic images. The aromatase inhibitor was discontinued and replaced with high-dose toremifene citrate, and trastuzumab was administered every other week. This regimen achieved efficacy, and the liver metastases regressed. As of 2years since the start of the initial treatment, no progression of the metastases has been observed, and the patient continues to be treated with the same regimen.</AbstractText>\n"

The purpose of this short communication was to disentangle the study's methodology in order to evaluate the soundness of this conclusion. We found that both the use of absolute differences as opposed to ratios; the sole focus on non-advanced tumours and the crude allocation of tumours and person-years by screening history for women aged 70-84 years, all contributed to the very high estimate of overdiagnosis. Screening affects cohorts of screened women. Danish registers allow very accurate mapping of the fate of every woman.

We herein report the rationale, preparation, biological evaluation, and mechanism of action of phenyl 4-(2-oxo-3-alkylimidazolidin-1-yl)benzenesulfonates (PAIB-SOs) that are antimicrotubule prodrugs activated by CYP1A1. Although PAIB-SOs are inert in most cells tested, they are highly cytocidal toward several human breast cancer cells, including hormone-independent and chemoresistant types. PAIB-SOs are N-dealkylated into cytotoxic phenyl 4-(2-oxo-3-imidazolidin-1-yl)benzenesulfonates (PIB-SOs) in CYP1A1-positive cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, PAIB-SOs are novel chemotherapeutic prodrugs with no equivalent among current antineoplastics and whose selective action toward breast cancer is tailored to the characteristic pattern of CYP1A1 expression observed in a large percentage of human breast tumors.</AbstractText>\n"

Measurement of DNA adducts formed by aromatic compounds, including PAH, has been carried in breast tissue samples and white blood cells from women with breast cancer and different kinds of controls. However, these studies provide inconsistent results and bias cannot be ruled out. During the 7-year follow-up period, 305 women were diagnosed with first primary breast cancer in the EPIC-Spain cohort, and were compared with a sample of 149 women without breast cancer at recruitment, using a case-cohort approach. Aromatic adducts to DNA from leukocytes collected at recruitment were measured by means of the 32P-post-labelling technique. The relative risk and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted by relevant confounders, were estimated by a modified version of Cox proportional hazards model. There was a significant increased risk for developing breast cancer when DNA adduct concentrations were doubled, with adjusted RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.29-2.01). The increase in breast cancer risk was observed both for pre- and post-menopausal women. There was a significant interaction with tobacco smoking and body mass index, with higher effect of DNA adducts on breast cancer risk among smokers and women with normal weight. The results from our study support the hypothesis that factors leading to higher levels of aromatic DNA adducts in white blood cells may be involved in development of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

However, in breast cancer, the expression levels, prognostic relevance and biological function of RPN11 remains unclear. In the present study, RPN11 expression levels in breast cancer tissues and adjacent non‑tumor tissues were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining, and the association of RPN11 with clinicopathological features of breast cancer was evaluated. RPN11 expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with healthy tissues. Additionally, high expression levels of RPN11 may be an indicator of poor prognosis, as validated by a breast cancer cohort from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Knockdown of RPN11 in MDA‑MB‑231 and T47D cells significantly reduced cell proliferation and enhanced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis. Exogenous overexpression of RPN11 in MCF7 and Hs578T cells promoted cell growth and inhibited apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of RPN11 abrogated cell migration and reduced epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, these findings suggested that RPN11 may function as an oncogene and its upregulation in breast cancer suggests that it may be a therapeutic target.</AbstractText>\n"

The PVT1 oncogene (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA, is found in this locus. PVT1 amplification is a frequent event in cancers, such as in lymphomas, serous ovarian, colorectal and breast cancers. Ectopic PVT1 expression is related with reduced survival duration in cancer patients. in the present study, we proved that PVT1 is markedly augmented in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Thus, PVT1 is an independent prognostic factor for the survival duration of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, PVT1 is pivotal in regulating p21 expression. In addition, we detected PVT1 DNA in serum and found that circulating PVT1 DNA significantly increased in the serum of breast cancer patients. Compared with PVT1 RNA, DNA is the main form of the PVT1-derived segment. These relevant findings collectively demonstrate that PVT1 plays a pivotal role in breast cancer and is a possible target for novel breast cancer therapies. The detection of circulating PVT1 DNA fragments may be a convenient means to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"

An improved understanding of the role of host immunosurveillance in modulating breast cancer disease biology, as well as impressive survival benefits seen to checkpoint blockade in other malignancies have provided great hope for an expanding role of immunotherapies in breast cancer management. While these novel therapies are currently being investigated in clinical trials, signals of efficacy, and tolerability in early phase studies suggest these will eventually make their way into standard practice algorithms. Ongoing research has highlighted a high degree of intertumoural heterogeneity in tumour lymphocytic infiltrates, suggesting some tumours or subtypes are more immunogenic than others. Furthermore, tumour intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion are beginning to be uncovered, potentially representing key therapeutic targets to use in combination with checkpoint blockade, exemplifying the emerging concept of personalised medicine approaches to immune therapies. Subsequently, different immunotherapeutic strategies may be required based on stratification by these factors-for the minority of tumours with a high level of pre-existing immunity, immune checkpoint blockade monotherapy may be sufficient. However, for the majority of tumours with lower levels of pre-existing immunity, combination approaches will likely be required to achieve maximal therapeutic effect. Results of ongoing clinical trials including combinations with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies are eagerly awaited.</AbstractText>\n"

It was demonstrated that the doses for most of organs-at-risk (OARs) were on average lower or equal in KBP plans compared to manual plans except for the senior planners, where the very small differences were not statistically significant. KBP data showed a systematic trend to have superior dose sparing at most parameters for the heart and ipsilateral lung.

During this new technique, patients experience an unpleasant sensation and slight edema. Most unpleasant and painful is mainly attributed to muscle contractions provoked by high amplitude and low repetition frequency pulses. Recently, we showed that electrochemotherapy using low voltage and higher repetition frequency (LVHF ECT) is an effective tool for inhibiting tumor growth and inducing cell permeabilization. Low voltage high-frequency electrochemotherapy was developed and optimized in vitro and in vivo which and can be used in the clinic. In the present study, we report a case of cervical lymph node metastasis of breast cancer treated by the technique. In our case, LVHF ECT was successful in reducing the size and palliating the symptoms of cervical lymph node metastasis in clinical conditions, whereas other approaches were inefficient. Our electrochemotherapy technique shows good clinical results. However, more studies on this new method are necessary to prove that LVHF ECT can be considered as a standard treatment modality.</AbstractText>\n"

It has been shown that inflammation plays a major role in the treatment of these cancers and inflammatory factors enhance tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and vascularization. In this study, we would like to analyze peripheral blood neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in breast cancer patients and its correlation with disease staging. This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted in Imam Hospital, affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences; a total of 195 female patients with breast cancer met the inclusion criteria. All of the patients had a complete blood count with leukocyte differential performed before chemotherapy. Medical records including pathology reports were also available. Data for all patients were collected prior to any surgical intervention. Exclusion criteria included clinical evidence of active infection, presence of hematological disorders, acute as well as chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, or prior steroid therapy. Higher platelet count was significantly associated with the higher stage. The stage was not associated with the hemoglobin level. There was no association between the tumor size and age of patients with NLR. There was a significant relationship between NLR and IDC. There was a significant relationship between IDC and NLRs of less than 8.1 and greater than 3.3. There was a significant relationship between NLR and vascular invasion. There was no association between NLR and estrogen receptor and HER2. There was no significant relationship between the PLR and the cancer stage. In this study, NLR showed a significant relation with the disease staging. As the NLR increases the stage increases as well. Therefore, this ratio may be helpful in the preoperative evaluation of patients with breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

In contrast, influx transport systems (e.g. GLUT transporters) that transport essential amino acids and nutrients to cancer cells have not been exploited much for targeted delivery. In this study, folic acid- or n-acetyl glucosamine- functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin (DOX-FA-MSNPs or DOX-NAG-MSNPs) were prepared, characterized and compared for targeting along with cytotoxicity towards MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Cellular uptake of FITC tagged FA-MSNPs and NAG-MSNPs were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry in above-mentioned cancer cell lines. The result suggested higher cellular uptake of NAG-MSNPs than FA-MSNPs for both the cell lines. Cytotoxicity of free DOX, DOX-MSNPs, DOX-FA-MSNPs and DOX-NAG-MSNPs were evaluated on both the breast cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity results showed that DOX-loaded NAG-MSNPs exerted significant higher cytotoxicity effect on both the cell lines than DOX-FA-MSNPs. Moreover, both the targeted formulations were more effective than free DOX. Our results suggested that GLUT transporters can be effectively utilized for nanoparticles internalization in breast cancer cells.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The American Cancer Society estimates that during 2016 in the USA around 430,000 individuals were diagnosed with one of these two types of cancers, and approximately 15% of them will die from the disease. In Europe, the rate of incidences and deaths are similar to those in the USA. Several different more or less successful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been developed and evaluated in order to tackle this issue and thereby decrease the death rates. By using nanoparticles as vehicles carrying both diagnostic and therapeutic molecular entities, individualized targeted theranostic nanomedicine has emerged as a promising option to increase the sensitivity and the specificity during diagnosis, as well as the likelihood of survival or prolonged survival after therapy. This article presents and discusses important and promising different kinds of nanoparticles, as well as imaging and therapy options, suitable for theranostic applications. The presentation of different nanoparticles and theranostic applications is quite general, but there is a special focus on prostate cancer. Some references and aspects regarding breast cancer are however also presented and discussed. Finally, the prostate cancer case is presented in more detail regarding diagnosis, staging, recurrence, metastases, and treatment options available today, followed by possible ways to move forward applying theranostics for both prostate and breast cancer based on promising experiments performed until today.</AbstractText>\n"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate antibody-indocyanine green (ICG) conjugates, which undergo dynamic absorption spectrum shifts after cellular endocytosis and degradation, and spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging to differentiate normal breast tissue from breast cancer by imaging B7-H3, a novel breast cancer associated molecular target. <b>Methods:</b> Quantitative immunohistochemical staining of endothelial and epithelial B7-H3 expression was assessed in 279 human breast tissue samples, including normal (n=53), benign lesions (11 subtypes, n=129), and breast cancers (4 subtypes, n=97). After absorption spectra of intracellular and degraded B7-H3-ICG and Isotype control-ICG (Iso-ICG) were characterized, sPA imaging in a transgenic murine breast cancer model (FVB/N-Tg(MMTVPyMT)634Mul) was performed and compared to imaging of control conditions [B7-H3-ICG in tumor negative animals (n=60), Iso-ICG (n=30), blocking B7-H3+B7-H3-ICG (n=20), and free ICG (n=20)] and validated with <i>ex vivo</i> histological analysis. <b>Results:</b> Immunostaining showed differential B7-H3 expression on both the endothelium and tumor epithelium in human breast cancer with an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 to differentiate breast cancer vs non-cancer. Combined <i>in vitro/in vivo</i> imaging showed that sPA allowed specific B7-H3-ICG detection down to the 13 nM concentration and differentiation from Iso-ICG. sPA molecular imaging of B7-H3-ICG showed a 3.01-fold (P&lt;0.01) increase in molecular B7-H3-ICG signal in tumors compared to control conditions. <b>Conclusions:</b> B7-H3 is a promising target for both vascular and epithelial sPA imaging of breast cancer. Leveraging antibody-ICG contrast agents and their dynamic optical absorption spectra allows for highly specific sPA imaging of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are promising anti-cancer drug targets. However, it's still unclear the applicability of anti-HSP90 and anti-HDAC6 strategies in precision treatment of breast cancer. In current study, we found that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, compared to T47D, an ERα+ breast cancer cell line, exhibited 7~40 times lower IC<sub>50</sub> values, stronger cell cycle perturbation, increased cell apoptosis and stronger inhibition of cell migration upon 17-DMAG treatment, while T47D, compared to TNBC cells, expressed higher HDAC6 and showed stronger anti-cancer response upon treatment of Tubacin. Mechanically, 17-DMAG treatment inhibited a complex network consists at least ERK, AKT, and Hippo pathway in TNBC cells, and higher expression of HDAC6 inhibited HSP90 activity via deacetylating HSP90. Furthermore, we found higher HDAC6 expression level in tamoxifen-resistance T47D than that in T47D, and Tubacin treatment suppressed the growth of tamoxifen-resistant cells <i>in vivo</i>. Our data suggested that anti-HSP90 and anti-HDAC6 are promising strategies to treat TNBC and ERα+ breast cancers respectively, and anti-HDAC6 can be considered during treatment of tamoxifen-resistance breast cancers.</AbstractText>\n"

Accumulating evidence has indicated that there is no effective targeted therapy available for TNBC. Dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (DPPA) is a bioactive phospholipid. However, the function of DPPA in the growth of TNBC has not yet been studied. In this study, we employed TNBC cells and a subcutaneous tumor model to elucidate the possible effect of DPPA on tumor growth in TNBC. We showed that DPPA significantly inhibited tumor growth in the mouse subcutaneous tumor model and suppressed cell proliferation and angiogenesis in TNBC tumor tissues. This inhibition was mediated partly by suppressing the expression of cyclin B1 (CCNB1), which directly promoted the accumulation of cells in the G2 phase and arrested cell cycle progression in human TNBC. In addition, the inhibition of tumor growth by DPPA may also be mediated by the suppression of tumor angiogenesis in TNBC. This work provides initial evidence that DPPA might be vital as an anti-tumor drug to treat TNBC.</AbstractText>\n"

Autophagy inhibition has been widely accepted as a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer, while the lack of effective and specific autophagy inhibitors hinders its application. Here we found that dichloroacetate (DCA), a small molecule compound, could significantly inhibit the autophagy induced by Doxorubicin in breast cancer cells. And DCA markedly enhances Doxorubicin-induced breast cancer cell death and anti-proliferation in vitro. But the sensitization to Dox of DCA was significantly reduced through induction of autophagy by rapamycin. Moreover, the combined therapy of Dox and DCA could significantly inhibit tumor growth in vivo and prolong mouse survival time. Taken together, we demonstrate that DCA could inhibit doxorubicin-inducing autophagy and provide a novel strategy for improving the anti-cancer efficacy of chemotherapy.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

Contrary to the requirement that allocation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) be blinded to avoid any possible intentional or unintentional subversion of a random allocation, all women in the CNBSS trials underwent a clinical breast examination prior to assignment to the study arm or the usual care arm. Women with abnormal clinical breast examinations were identified, and this information was available to the coordinators who then assigned the women on open lists. It was, therefore, possible to assign women to whichever arm the coordinator chose. Although subversion was likely unintended, a significant number of women with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes were assigned to the screening arm of CNBSS1. This explains why there were more breast cancer deaths among the screened women in the first ten years of the trial and why the 5 year survival of the control women was better than 90% when the background survival in Canada at the time was only 75%. The trials were further compromised by the poor quality of the mammography which was confirmed by a review conducted by the trials' organizers. These fundamental problems compromise the CNBSS and make their results, which are major outliers in the RCT's of breast cancer screening, unreliable. Consequently, they should not be used to establish guidelines for breast cancer screening.</AbstractText>\n"

The coprimary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (per independent review committee assessment) and overall survival. Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat population; safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients analysed according to the treatment actually received. On May 30, 2012, the study protocol was amended to allow crossover from control to trastuzumab emtansine after the second interim overall survival analysis crossed the prespecified overall survival efficacy boundary. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00829166.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"FINDINGS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Between Feb 23, 2009, and Oct 13, 2011, 991 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either trastuzumab emtansine (n=495) or capecitabine and lapatinib (control; n=496). In this final descriptive analysis, median overall survival was longer with trastuzumab emtansine than with control (29·9 months [95% CI 26·3-34·1] vs 25·9 months [95% CI 22·7-28·3]; hazard ratio 0·75 [95% CI 0·64-0·88]). 136 (27%) of 496 patients crossed over from control to trastuzumab emtansine after the second interim overall survival analysis (median follow-up duration 24·1 months [IQR 19·5-26·1]). Of those patients originally randomly assigned to trastuzumab emtansine, 254 (51%) of 495 received capecitabine and 241 [49%] of 495 received lapatinib (separately or in combination) after study drug discontinuation. In the safety population (488 patients treated with capecitabine plus lapatinib, 490 patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine), fewer grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred with trastuzumab emtansine (233 [48%] of 490) than with capecitabine plus lapatinib control treatment (291 [60%] of 488). In the control group, the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (103 [21%] of 488 patients) followed by palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (87 [18%]), and vomiting (24 [5%]). The safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine was similar to that reported previously; the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in the trastuzumab emtansine group were thrombocytopenia (70 [14%] of 490), increased aspartate aminotransferase levels (22 [5%]), and anaemia (19 [4%]). Nine patients died from adverse events; five of these deaths were judged to be related to treatment (two in the control group [coronary artery disease and multiorgan failure] and three in the trastuzumab emtansine group [metabolic encephalopathy, neutropenic sepsis, and acute myeloid leukaemia]).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"INTERPRETATION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">This descriptive analysis of final overall survival in the EMILIA trial shows that trastuzumab emtansine improved overall survival in patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer even in the presence of crossover treatment. The safety profile was similar to that reported in previous analyses, reaffirming trastuzumab emtansine as an efficacious and tolerable treatment in this patient population.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"FUNDING\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">F Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe the discovery of novel potent inverse agonists of ERRα. In vitro, compound 11 potently inhibits ERRα's transcriptional activity by preventing endogenous PGC-1α and ERRα binding and suppresses the proliferation of different human cancer cell lines and the migration of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). In vivo, compound 11 demonstrates a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of human breast cancer xenografts (MDA-MB-231) and the tumor growth is inhibited by 40.9% after treating with compound 11 (30 mg/kg). The binding mode shows that compound 11 interacts with the binding pocket of ERRα through hydrogen interactions with the residue Gly397 and hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic residues. All these results suggest that compound 11 represents a novel potent ERRα inverse agonist and is promising in the discovery of antitumor compounds for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

However, the molecular mechanism of miR-874 downregulation in breast cancer has not been well elucidated. Here we aimed to study the aberrant hyper-methylation of CpG sites with the utility of miR-874 downreregulation in breast cancer and evaluate the clinical function of miR-874 as a prognostic marker. The miR-874 expressions in cells and tissues of two breast cancer lines were measured by real-time PCR. The DNA methylation status of the miR-874 promoter region in 19 pairs of breast cancer and adjacent normal samples was analyzed with Sequenom EpiTYPER MassArray. To evaluate whether miR-874 is a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer, we also explored the clinical long-time follow-up records from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found miR-874 expression was downregulated in 47 pairs of breast cancer tissues. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed miR-874 expression may be a prognostic biomarker of overall survival in breast cancer patients. Preconditioning with 5-Aza-CdR in two cell lines elevated miR-874 expressions. The data from Sequenom EpiTYPER MassArray showed that DNA methylation of the promoter region of miR-874 was upregulated and accompanied by decreased miR-874 expression, which was further confirmed by TCGA. After comprehensive considerations, we think miR-874, which might be served as a prognostic biomarker, is mediated by DNA methylation.</AbstractText>\n"

CST1 has been recently considered to be involved in the development of several human cancers. However, the prognostic significance and function of CST1 in breast cancer remains unknown. In the current study, we found that CST1 was generally upregulated in breast cancer at both mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in the low CST1 expression subgroup were significantly superior to the high CST1 expression subgroup (OS, p &lt; 0.001; DFS, p &lt; 0.001), which indicated that CST1 expression level was closely correlated to the survival risk of these patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that CST1 expression was an independent prognostic factor, the same as ER status and nodal status. Next, CST1 overexpression promoted breast cancer cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion abilities. By contrast, knockdown of CST1 attenuated these malignant characteristics in breast cancer cells. Collectively, our study indicates that CST1 cannot only serve as a significant prognostic indicator but also as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"KEY MESSAGES\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">High CST1 expression is negatively correlated with survival of breast cancer patients.

Breast cancer has been divided in subtypes depending on the presence of hormone receptors (HRs) for estrogen and progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification. Recently, a distinct subcategory has been analyzed from the group of HER2-enriched BC with positive HR, namely HER2 positive with high levels of hormone receptor expression, suggestively named &quot;triple positive&quot; breast cancer. We aim to review current evidence on this subtype of BC, from the molecular mechanisms regulating its behavior to the current standard treatment outcome in order to establish whether it qualifies as a new distinct subtype of BC. Its biology is dominated by the crosstalks between HR pathway and HER2 pathway, which might be responsible for the development of rapid resistance to treatment, because of estrogen receptor up-regulation and alternate regulatory pathways activation when anti-HER2 agents are used. &quot;Triple positive&quot; subtype has apparently similar outcome when treated with chemotherapy alone, compared to chemotherapy and anti-HER2 agents treatment. It resembles more to luminal A breast cancer, with positive HR and HER2 negative. However, most of the clinical evidence is provided by retrospective trials with multiple potential biases. Treatment of &quot;triple positive&quot; subtype of BC with anti-HER2 agents and chemotherapy remain standard until stronger evidence will be available. Whether &quot;triple positive&quot; category should be regarded as a separate entity with distinct characteristics and management has to be demonstrated in future better designed trials.</AbstractText>\n"

Randomisation was by SX number, a sequential unique identifier of each woman within the NHSBSP, and at the beginning of the study a coin toss decided whether women with odd or even SX numbers would be allocated to the intervention group. Women aged 50-70 years who did not attend their first offered appointment were eligible for the analysis. The primary endpoint was participation (ie, attendance at breast cancer screening) within 90 days of the date of the first offered appointment; we used Poisson regression to compare the proportion of women who participated in screening in the study groups.

Recently, we showed that tumour volume to breast volume ratio as well as tumour location in the breast are independent predictors of superior cosmetic result following BCS. Implementation of a prediction model including both factors, has not been studied in a prospective manner. This study aims to improve cosmetic outcome by implementation of a prediction model in the treatment decision making for breast cancer patients opting for BCS.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS/DESIGN\">Multicentre, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing standard preoperative work-up to a preoperative work-up with addition of the prediction model. Tumour volume to breast volume ratio and tumour location in the breast will be used to predict cosmetic outcome in invasive breast cancer patients opting for BCS. Three dimensional (3D)-ultrasonography will be used to measure the tumour volume to breast volume ratio needed for the prediction model. Sample size was estimated based on a 14% improvement in incidence of superior cosmetic result one year after BCS (71% in the control group versus 85% in the intervention group). Primarily cosmetic outcome will be evaluated by a 6-member independent panel. Secondary endpoints include; (1) patient reported outcome measured by BREAST-Q, EORTC-QLQ-C30/BR23 and EQ-5D-5 L (2) cosmetic outcome as assessed through the BCCT.core software, (3) radiation-induced reaction (4) surgical treatment performed, (5) pathological result and (6) cost-effectiveness.

Strategies include vaccination, screening, and early diagnosis. Population-based surveys, such as those conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, can collect the information needed to guide cancer control efforts in a standardized comparable manner. We identified and evaluated the breadth of breast and cervical cancer screening information that was collected by the DHS from 1984 through 2015. Then, we determined if these surveys currently provide the specific and measurable data about both the quantity and quality of cancer screening needed to guide national efforts to reduce the overall effects of cervical and breast cancers. We searched the DHS website to identify surveys conducted between the start of the DHS Program in 1984 and November 2015 that included questions about breast and cervical cancer screening. The relevant questions were extracted from the questionnaire, translated into English, and grouped by themes. Of the 90 countries where DHS surveys have been implemented, cervical cancer screening questions were included in 22 countries (24.4%) and breast cancer screening questions in 18 countries (20.0%). The common themes identified were disease knowledge, screening knowledge, screening practice, and screening outcomes. Most countries with survey questionnaires available for review addressed at least one aspect of screening practice (88.9% of cervical and 87.5% of breast), although few countries queried knowledge and outcomes. Questions that assess varied aspects of breast and cervical cancer screening have been incorporated into relatively few DHS surveys. The themes identified could guide the design of a standard set of questions for use in future population-based surveys and enable evaluation beyond the existence of screening, which would include assessment of the quality and impact of cervical and breast cancer screening.</AbstractText>\n"

However, reports are conflicting regarding the presence of heterogeneity for many exposures. To examine subtype heterogeneity across known breast cancer risk factors, we conducted a case-control analysis of 2,632 breast cancers and 15,945 controls in Sweden. Molecular subtype was predicted from pathology record-derived IHC markers by a classifier trained on PAM50 subtyping. Multinomial logistic regression estimated separate ORs for each subtype by the exposures parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding, menarche, hormone replacement therapy use, somatotype at age 18, benign breast disease, mammographic density, polygenic risk score, family history of breast cancer, and BRCA mutations. We found clear subtype heterogeneity for genetic factors and breastfeeding. Polygenic risk score was associated with all subtypes except for the basal-like (<i>P</i><sub>heterogeneity</sub> &lt; 0.0001). &quot;Never breastfeeding&quot; was associated with increased risk of basal-like subtype [OR 4.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-9.21] compared with both nulliparity (reference) and breastfeeding. Breastfeeding was not associated with risk of HER2-overexpressing type, but protective for all other subtypes. The observed heterogeneity in risk of distinct breast cancer subtypes for germline variants supports heterogeneity in etiology and has implications for their use in risk prediction. The association between basal-like subtype and breastfeeding merits more research into potential causal mechanisms and confounders. <i>Cancer Res; 77(13); 3708-17. ©2017 AACR</i>.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

In the SHAPE-2 trial, 243 postmenopausal overweight women were included. The intervention in this trial consisted of 5-6 kg weight loss either by diet only or exercise plus diet. After 16 weeks, we measured serum sex hormones, inflammatory markers, total body fat (measured by DEXA scan) and intra and subcutaneous abdominal fat (measured by MRI). Associations between changes in different body fat depots and biomarkers were analysed by linear regression using the study cohort irrespective of randomisation to make maximal use of the distribution of changes in fat measures. We found that a loss in total body fat was associated with favourable changes in free oestradiol, free testosterone, leptin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The loss of intra-abdominal fat was associated with a decrease in free testosterone, hsCRP and leptin, and an increase in SHBG. In the multivariable analysis, the best fitted models for the biomarkers free oestradiol, SHBG leptin and adiponectin included only total body fat. For free testosterone, this was subcutaneous abdominal fat, and for hsCRP and IL-6, only intra-abdominal fat change was important. For IL-6 and adiponectin, however, associations were weak and not significant. We conclude that, in our population of healthy overweight postmenopausal women, loss of fat at different body locations was associated with changes in different types of biomarkers, known to be related to risk of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 Society for Endocrinology.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

A total of 130 axillary LNs in 130 patients who underwent SWE before fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy or surgery were analyzed. On gray-scale images, long and short axes, shape (elliptical or round), border (sharp or unsharp) and cortical thickening (concentric, eccentric or no fatty hilum) of LNs were assessed. On SWE, mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and the lesion-to-fat ratio (E<sub>ratio</sub>) values of elasticity were collected. Gray-scale and SWE features were compared statistically between metastatic and benign LNs using the χ<sup>2</sup>-test and independent t-test. Diagnostic performance of each feature was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Logistic regression analysis was used to determine gray-scale or SWE features independently associated with metastatic LNs. Of the 130 LNs, 65 (50%) were metastatic and 65 (50%) were benign after surgery. Metastatic LNs were significantly larger (p = 0.018); had higher elasticity indexes at SWE (p &lt; 0.0001); and had higher proportions of round shape (p = 0.033), unsharp border (p = 0.048) and eccentric cortical thickening or no fatty hilum (p = 0.005) compared with benign LNs. On multivariate analysis, E<sub>ratio</sub> was independently associated with metastatic LNs (odds ratio = 3.312, p = 0.008).

Even though the prognosis of IBC was significantly improved by multimodal management, including the systematic use of cytotoxic-based induction, the prognosis remains largely dismal. Areas covered: This review presents the main achievements in the systemic treatment of IBC during the past 30 years. It focuses more specifically on recent results obtained with targeted therapies, including anti-HER2 and anti-angiogenic agents. Novel approaches under investigation are presented. Expert commentary: Current management of IBC is subtype-specific and the largest benefit has been achieved in HER2-positive disease. The identification of breakthrough therapeutic advances is eagerly awaited and will require the development of IBC-specific clinical trials. Future clinical investigations should not only aim to increase the pathological response rate but also to eradicate distant metastases, which ultimately lead to patient death.</AbstractText>\n"

The renal tumor was suspected to be clear cell carcinoma, cT1aN0M0, based on contrast-enhanced CT. Surgery was considered necessary for both the breast cancer and renal tumor. First, laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed for the renal tumor. However, the lateroconal fascia adhered strongly to the perirenal fat, and so simple nephrectomy was carried out after conversion to open surgery. The perirenal fat was also excised after the nephrectomy. A histopathological examination revealed clear cell carcinoma and renal invasion by invasive lobular cancer cells. Also, scattered metastases were detected in the perirenal fat and the lateroconal fascia. So, it was considered that retroperitoneal metastases from the breast cancer had directly invaded the kidney.

In this study, we loaded an anti-cancer drug, cabazitaxel (CTX), into polymeric micelles (CTX-loaded polymeric micelles, PCMs), and explored their therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer metastasis. The characteristics of PCMs were investigated, and their anti-metastatic efficacy was assessed using in vitro and in vivo evaluations. PCMs had an average diameter of 50.13±11.96 nm with a CTX encapsulation efficiency of 97.02%±0.97%. PCMs could be effectively internalized into metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells in vitro. CTX (10 ng/mL) or an equivalent concentration in PCMs did not significantly affected the viability of 4T1 cells, but dramatically decreased the cell migration activities. In an orthotopic metastatic breast cancer model, intravenously administered PCMs could be efficiently delivered to the tumor sites, resulting in a 71.6% inhibition of tumor growth and a 93.5% reduction of lung metastases. Taken together, our results verify the anti-metastatic efficacy of PCMs, thus providing an encouraging strategy for treating breast cancer metastasis.</AbstractText>\n"

Here, we demonstrated that ioversol CEST MRI can be exploited to achieve pHe mapping of the liver cancer microenvironment. In in vitro studies, we firstly explored whether ioversol signal is pH-dependent, and calculated the function equation between the CEST effects of ioversol and pH values, in the range of 6.0 to 7.8, by a ratiometric method. Then we verified the feasibility of this technique and the equation in vivo by applying pHe imaging in an MMTV-Erbb2 transgenic mouse breast cancer model, which is often used in CEST pHe studies. Furthermore, in vivo ioversol CEST MRI, we were able to map relative pHe and differentiate between tumor and normal tissue in a McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma model. This suggests pHe may be a useful biomarker for human liver cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

This was a retrospective study of 115,474 patients who were surgically treated for primary breast cancer between 1987 and 2011 in Korea. All data were collected by the Korean Breast Cancer Society (KBCS) online breast cancer registry. Each hospital serologically examined the ABO blood types of patients before surgery. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) or breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) among ABO blood types. Type of surgery; T stage; N stage; histologic grade; status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2; and chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors of OS and BCSS in univariate analysis and multivariate analyses. Compared to women with blood type O, there was a difference in OS and BCSS for blood type A, blood type B, or blood type AB. Compared to blood group non-O, patients with blood group O were more likely to have favorable prognosis when younger than 40 years.

The most common site of breast cancer metastasis is the bone, which has been shown to provide a rich microenvironment that supports the migration and growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that breast cancer cells that do successfully metastasize have a stem-like phenotype including high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and/or a CD44+CD24- phenotype. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that these ALDHhiCD44+CD24- breast cancer cells interact with factors in the bone secondary organ microenvironment to facilitate metastasis. Specifically, we focused on bone-derived osteopontin and its ability to promote the migration and stem-like phenotype of breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that bone-derived osteopontin promotes the migration, tumorsphere-forming ability and colony-forming ability of whole population and ALDHhiCD44+CD24- breast cancer cells in bone marrow-conditioned media (an ex vivo representation of the bone microenvironment) (p≤0.05). We also demonstrate that CD44 and RGD-dependent cell surface integrins facilitate this functional response to bone-derived osteopontin (p≤0.05), potentially through activation of WNK-1 and PRAS40-related pathways. Our findings suggest that soluble bone-derived osteopontin enhances the ability of breast cancer cells to migrate to the bone and maintain a stem-like phenotype within the bone microenvironment, and this may contribute to the establishment and growth of bone metastases.</AbstractText>\n"

Patients and Methods Pyrotinib was administered continuously, orally, once per day to patients who did not have prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of HER2. Planned dose escalation was 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, timed blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 28. Next-generation sequencing was performed on circulating tumor DNA and genomic DNA from tumor samples. Results Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea, which occurred in two patients administered 480 mg of pyrotinib; thus, the maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg. Common pyrotinib-related adverse events included diarrhea (44.7% [17 of 38]), nausea (13.2% [five of 38]), oral ulceration (13.2% [five of 38]), asthenia (10.5% [four of 38]), and leukopenia (10.5% [four of 38]). The only grade 3 adverse event was diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that pyrotinib exposure was dose dependent. The overall response rate was 50.0% (18 of 36), and the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 61.1% (22 of 36). The median progression-free survival was 35.4 weeks (95% CI, 23.3 to 40.0 weeks). The overall response rate was 83.3% (10 of 12) in trastuzumab-naive patients and 33.3% (eight of 24) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Preliminary results suggest that PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in circulating tumor DNA ( P = .013) rather than in archival tumor tissues ( P = .474) may predict the efficacy of pyrotinib. Conclusion Continuous once-per-day pyrotinib was well tolerated and demonstrated promising antitumor activity in HER2-positive patients with metastatic breast cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was established as 400 mg. Diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxicity. The promising antitumor activity and acceptable tolerability of pyrotinib warrant its further evaluation in a phase II study.</AbstractText>\n"

SP cells have been reported to act as cancer stem‑like cells, and to participate in the development of multidrug resistance via modulating the expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2). Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid drug that has been used as an adjuvant treatment to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents; however, its effects in breast cancer have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In the present study, the effects of dexamethasone were investigated using the human MCF‑7 breast cancer cell line, and SPs were examined in detail. Cellular proliferation, SP fractions and ABCG2 expression were examined following treatment of MCF‑7 cells with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone was revealed to cause a dose‑ and time‑dependent decrease in cancer cell proliferation, and it also decreased the size of the SP fraction of MCF‑7 cells and the expression of the ABCG2 transporter. The effects of dexamethasone on cellular proliferation, SP fraction and ABCG2 expression were abolished following the administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486. These results suggested that dexamethasone may target breast cancer cell SPs and thus increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that dexamethasone can be used as a chemosensitizer in the adjuvant treatment of patients with breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

However, its clinical significance in breast cancer remains unclear. To this end, quantitative PCR was performed to measure PRKDC expression level in 59 pairs of breast cancer tissues and the non-tumor adjacent tissues (NATs). The correlation between PRKDC expression and overall survival (OS) as well as the prognostic value of PRKDC were analyzed. In vitro and in vivo effects of PRKDC on chemosensitivity were evaluated in MCF-7 cells. We found that PRKDC expression was significantly increased in breast cancer tissue samples compared with NATs. High PRKDC expression was associated with higher tumor grade (P=0.001), positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.0357) and chemoresistance (P=0.0006). Furthermore, PRKDC expression was significantly correlated with OS in breast cancer patients with (0.0101) or without (P=0.0216) receiving chemotherapy. PRKDC was an independent prognostic factor of OS in breast cancer (P=0.022, hazard ratio=2.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.81-3.84). Moreover, downregulation of PRKDC sensitized MCF-7 cells to chemo-drugs both in vitro and in a xenografted mouse model.

Administration of hormone therapy concurrently with chemotherapy and HER2 targeted therapy is generally not recommended. Using publically available gene expression datasets we found that high expression of IGF1R is associated with shorter disease-free survival in patients whose tumors are ER positive and HER2 positive. IGF1R is frequently expressed in HER2 positive breast cancer and there is significant evidence for crosstalk between IGF1R and both HER2 and ER. Therefore, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting ER and IGF1R in cell line models of HER2/ER/IGF1R positive breast cancer, using tamoxifen and two IGF1R targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (NVP-AEW541 and BMS-536924). Dual inhibition of ER and IGF1R enhanced growth inhibition in the four HER2 positive cell lines tested and caused an increase in cell cycle arrest in G1 in BT474 cells. In addition, combined treatment with trastuzumab, tamoxifen and either of the IGF1R TKIs enhanced response compared to dual targeting strategies in three of the four HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines tested. Furthermore, in a cell line model of trastuzumab-resistant HER2 positive breast cancer (BT474/Tr), tamoxifen combined with an IGF1R TKI produced a similar enhanced response as observed in the parental BT474 cells suggesting that this combination may overcome acquired trastuzumab resistance in this model. Combining ER and IGF1R targeting with HER2 targeted therapies may be an alternative to HER2 targeted therapy and chemotherapy for patients with HER2/ER/IGF1R positive breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

Predictive factors included age, episodes of febrile neutropenia and grade III or IV hypersensitivity reaction to taxanes. Other adverse events, such as peripheral neuropathy, did not affect RDI. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclofosfamide, docetaxel (FEC-D) protocol was 24% and therefore was above the threshold set by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer for primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. No relationship between RDI and (disease-free) survival was found with a median follow-up of 38 months. Apart from the stage of disease, obesity is a predictor of poor outcome.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\">RDI &lt;85% is predicted by patients' age, febrile neutropenia and hypersensitivity reactions to taxanes. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in FEC-D treatment indicates primary prophylaxis with G-CSF following docetaxel treatment.

We investigated the interaction between HER2, HER3 and the ER in vitro using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with human HER2, HER3, and ERα. We also investigated the additive efficacy of combination regimens consisting of anti-HER3 (lumretuzumab), anti-HER2 (pertuzumab), and endocrine (fulvestrant) therapy in vivo. Our data show that both HER2 and HER3 can directly complex with the ER and can mediate phosphorylation of the ER. Phosphorylation of the ER was only observed in cells that expressed both HER2 and ERα or in heregulin-stimulated cells that expressed both HER3 and ERα. Using a mouse xenograft model of ER+/HER2-low (HER2 immunohistochemistry 1+ or 2+ without gene amplification) human breast cancer we show that the combination of lumretuzumab and pertuzumab is highly efficacious and induces long-lasting tumor regression in vivo and adding endocrine therapy (fulvestrant) to this combination further improved efficacy. In addition, a prolonged clinical response was observed with the combination of lumretuzumab and pertuzumab in a patient with ER+/HER2-low breast cancer who had failed endocrine therapy. These preclinical data confirm that direct cross talk exists between HER2/HER3 and ER which may explain the resistance mechanisms to endocrine therapy and monoclonal antibodies that target HER2 and HER3. Our data also indicate that the triplet of anti-HER2, anti-HER3, and endocrine therapy might be an efficacious combination for treating patients with ER+/HER2-low breast cancer, which is an area of significant unmet medical need.</AbstractText>\n"

Uptake into brain grafts was similar to mammary grafts. Despite this, muMAb 4D5 was less efficacious in brain grafts. Co-administration of muMAb 4D5 and GNE-317, a brain-penetrant PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, provided longer survival in mice with brain lesions than either agent alone.

Most of the population depends on the public healthcare system, which affects the diagnosis of the tumor. Thus, the indicators observed in developed countries cannot be directly compared with those observed in developing countries because the healthcare infrastructures in developing countries are deficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate breast cancer screening strategies and indicators in developing countries. A systematic review and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Timing, and Setting methodology were performed to identify possible indicators of presentation at diagnosis and the methodologies used in developing countries. We searched PubMed for the terms &quot;Breast Cancer&quot; or &quot;Breast Cancer Screening&quot; and &quot;Developing Country&quot; or &quot;Developing Countries&quot;. In all, 1,149 articles were identified. Of these articles, 45 full articles were selected, which allowed us to identify indicators related to epidemiology, diagnostic intervention (diagnostic strategy, diagnostic infrastructure, percentage of women undergoing mammography), quality of intervention (presentation of symptoms at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, early stage disease), comparisons (trend curves, subpopulations at risk) and survival among different countries. The identification of these indicators will improve the reporting of methodologies used in developing countries and will allow us to evaluate improvements in public health related to breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

The present study aimed to identify the inflammation-based parameters that are most suitable for predicting outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Two hundred ninety-six patients who underwent surgery for localized breast cancer were reviewed retrospectively. The association between clinicopathological factors and inflammation-based parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic indicators associated with disease-free survival (DFS). The NLR level correlated significantly with tumor size (P&lt;0.05). The PLR level correlated with the expression of estrogen receptor and lymph node involvement (P&lt;0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that lower CRP and PLR values as well as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and nuclear grade were significantly associated with superior DFS (CRP: P&lt;0.01; PLR, tumor size, lymph node involvement, and nuclear grade: P&lt;0.05). On multivariate analysis, CRP (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-7.88, P&lt;0.05), PLR (HR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.07-6.36, P&lt;0.05) and nuclear grade (HR: 3.066, 95% CI: 1.26-7.49, P&lt;0.05) were significant prognostic indicators of DFS in patients with breast cancer. Neither LMR nor NLR significantly predicted DFS. Both preoperative CRP and PLR values were independently associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma; these were superior to other inflammation-based scores in terms of prognostic ability.</AbstractText>\n"

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detected in a liquid biopsy can be sampled and characterized repeatedly during therapy in order to monitor treatment response and disease progression.Our aim was to investigate how CTC derived gene expression of treatment predictive markers (ESR1/HER2) and other cancer associated markers changed in patient blood samples during six months of first-line systemic treatment for MBC. CTCs from 36 patients were enriched using CellSearch (Janssen Diagnostics) and AdnaTest (QIAGEN) before gene expression analysis was performed with a customized gene panel (TATAA Biocenter).Our results show that antibodies against HER2 and EGFR were valuable to isolate CTCs unidentified by CellSearch and possibly lacking EpCAM expression. Evaluation of patients with clinically different breast cancer subgroups demonstrated that gene expression of treatment predictive markers changed over time. This change was especially prominent for HER2 expression.In conclusion, we found that changed gene expression during first-line systemic therapy for MBC could be a possible explanation for treatment resistance. Characterization of CTCs at several time-points during therapy could be informative for treatment selection.</AbstractText>\n"

Here, we evaluated whether TCC is noninferior to CBT-I for the treatment of insomnia in survivors of breast cancer. Patients and Methods This was a randomized, partially blinded, noninferiority trial that involved survivors of breast cancer with insomnia who were recruited from the Los Angeles community from April 2008 to July 2012. After a 2-month phase-in period with repeated baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to 3 months of CBT-I or TCC and evaluated at months 2, 3 (post-treatment), 6, and 15 (follow-up). Primary outcome was insomnia treatment response-that is, marked clinical improvement of symptoms by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-at 15 months. Secondary outcomes were clinician-assessed remission of insomnia; sleep quality; total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and awake after sleep onset, derived from sleep diaries; polysomnography; and symptoms of fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Results Of 145 participants who were screened, 90 were randomly assigned (CBT-I: n = 45; TCC: n = 45). The proportion of participants who showed insomnia treatment response at 15 months was 43.7% and 46.7% in CBT-I and TCC, respectively. Tests of noninferiority showed that TCC was noninferior to CBT-I at 15 months ( P = .02) and at months 3 ( P = .02) and 6 ( P &lt; .01). For secondary outcomes, insomnia remission was 46.2% and 37.9% in CBT-I and TCC, respectively. CBT-I and TCC groups showed robust improvements in sleep quality, sleep diary measures, and related symptoms (all P &lt; .01), but not polysomnography, with similar improvements in both groups. Conclusion CBT-I and TCC produce clinically meaningful improvements in insomnia. TCC, a mindful movement meditation, was found to be statistically noninferior to CBT-I, the gold standard for behavioral treatment of insomnia.</AbstractText>\n"

In clinical trials, palbociclib in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women (PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-2), or in combination with fulvestrant in pre-, peri-, or postmenopausal women with disease progression after endocrine therapy (PALOMA-3), significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and improved clinical benefit response (CBR) rates. Neutropenia was the most commonly reported any-grade and grade ≥ 3 adverse event. It was infrequently associated with febrile neutropenia (&lt;2%) and generally manageable with a palbociclib dose delay, interruption or reduction, without the routine use of growth factors, and without affecting efficacy. In conclusion, oral palbociclib combination therapy is a valuable emerging option for use in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n"

In this two-stage study, we first used an Arraystar Human circRNA Array to construct a genome-wide circRNA profile. We then selected candidate circRNAs for validation using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction system. CircRNA/miRNA interactions were predicted and sequence analyses were performed. Among 1155 differentially expressed circRNAs, 715 were upregulated and 440 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues. The validation study demonstrated that hsa_circ_103110, hsa_circ_104689 and hsa_circ_104821 levels were elevated in breast cancer tissues, whereas hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were downregulated. These circRNAs targeted complementary miRNA response elements. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing breast cancer was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.90) when hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were used in combination. This study provides evidence that circRNAs are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are important in carcinogenesis because they participate in cancer-related pathways and sequester miRNAs.</AbstractText>\n"

Women were recruited from 127 clinical centres and hospitals in the UK and Ireland, and randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two treatment regimens: epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (four cycles of 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously administered epirubicin and 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously administered cyclophosphamide on day 1 every 3 weeks, followed by four cycles of 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> paclitaxel as a 3 h infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) or epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (the same chemotherapy regimen as the other group, with the addition of 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> gemcitabine to the paclitaxel cycles, administered intravenously as a 0·5 h infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks). Patients were randomly assigned by a central computerised deterministic minimisation procedure, with stratification by country, age, radiotherapy intent, nodal status, and oestrogen receptor and HER-2 status. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival and the trial aimed to detect 5% differences in 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment groups. Recruitment completed in 2004 and this is the final, intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2004-002927-41), ISRCTN (51146252), and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00039546).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"FINDINGS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Between Aug 22, 2001, and Nov 26, 2004, 3152 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine (gemcitabine group; n=1576) or to epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (control group; n=1576). 11 patients (six in the gemcitabine group and five in the control group) were ineligible because of pre-existing metastases and were therefore excluded from the analysis. At this protocol-specified final analysis (median follow-up 10 years [IQR 10-10]), 1087 disease-free survival events and 914 deaths had occurred. Disease-free survival did not differ significantly between the treatment groups at 10 years (65% [63-68] in the gemcitabine group vs 65% [62-67] in the control group), and median disease-free survival was not reached (adjusted hazard ratio 0·97 [95% CI 0·86-1·10], p=0·64). Toxicity, dose intensity, and a detailed safety substudy showed both regimens to be safe, deliverable, and tolerable. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were reported at expected levels in both groups. The most common were neutropenia (527 [34%] of 1565 patients in the gemcitabine group vs 412 [26%] of 1567 in the control group), myalgia and arthralgia (207 [13%] vs 186 [12%]), fatigue (207 [13%] vs 152 [10%]), infection (202 [13%] vs 141 [9%]), vomiting (143 [9%] vs 108 [7%]), and nausea (132 [8%] vs 102 [7%]).</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"INTERPRETATION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The addition of gemcitabine to anthracycline and taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy at this dose and schedule confers no therapeutic advantage in terms of disease-free survival in early breast cancer, although it can cause increased toxicity.

"28478828","2017/05/09 06:00","Tidal chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.","<AbstractText>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains an inseparable part of systemic therapy for hormone receptor positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer. However, efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this subtype of patients is inferior to its hormone receptor negative counterpart. Several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that it was growth rate rather than hormone receptor status that determined sensitivity to chemotherapy. In addition, estrogen was proved to recruit more HR+ breast cancer cells into actively dividing phase according to various studies. For premenopausal females, sexual hormone like estradiol fluctuates with menstrual cycle. When menstruation occurs, women have the lowest level of estradiol, which is resemble to pharmaceutical effect of endocrine therapy. If chemotherapy is given to females during menstruation, it's almost equal to concurrent use of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, which is not recommended by guideline. Accordingly, chemotherapy would attain best efficacy applied at the peak of estradiol, because more tumor cells being in actively dividing phase recruited by comparatively high level of estradiol would help cytotoxic agents function better given that majority of chemotherapeutic drugs are cellular phase dependent. We name this rhythmic mode of chemotherapy for premenopausal HR+breast cancer females, giving chemotherapy to patients when estradiol rises and avoiding prescription at menstruation, tidal chemotherapy. It's postulated that tidal chemotherapy would improve efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal HR+breast cancer females, achieve more pathologic complete response and in the long run improve prognosis.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to assess Ki67 expression assessed on TMAs and their matched whole tissue sections (WTS). Moreover, whether the cut-off used for WTS is reproducible on TMA in BC molecular classes and the association between Ki67 expression cut-off, assessed on TMAs and WTS, and clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome were tested.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"METHOD\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">A large series (n = 707) of primary invasive breast tumours were immunostained for Ki67 using both TMA and WTS and assessed as percentage staining and correlated with each other, clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome. In addition, MKI67 mRNA expression was correlated with Ki67 protein levels on WTS and TMAs in a subset of cases included in the METABRIC study.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">There was moderate concordance in Ki67 expression between WTS and TMA when analysed as a continuous variable (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.61) and low concordance when dichotomised (kappa value = 0.3). TMA showed low levels of Ki67 with mean percentage of expression of 35 and 22% on WTS and TMA, respectively. MKI67 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with protein expression determined on WTS (Spearman Correlation, r = 0.52) and to a lesser extent on TMA (r = 0.34) (p &lt; 0.001). Regarding prediction of patient outcome, statistically significant differences were detected upon stratification of patients with tumours expressing Ki67 at 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30% in TMA.

Unfortunately, the emergence of resistance is inevitable and subsequent treatment is not well defined. Numerous mechanisms have been implicated in the development of resistance; central among them is the activation of compensatory signaling pathways. Despite the rationale that supports combining agents targeting these pathways with hormonal therapies in an attempt to delay or even reverse endocrine resistance, most clinical trials have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. Although the inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway and of CDK 4/6 function has led to meaningful prolongations of progression free survival, no overall survival gains have been reported yet. Considering the associated toxicity and costs, genomic-driven trials are eagerly needed in order to refine management strategies and achieve a truly personalized approach for this patient subgroup.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Common types include Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), Tubular carcinoma, Medullary carcinoma, and Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). While detecting cancer, one important factor is mitotic count - showing how rapidly the cells are dividing. But the class imbalance problem, due to the small number of mitotic nuclei in comparison to the overwhelming number of non-mitotic nuclei, affects the performance of classification models. This work presents a two-phase model to mitigate the class biasness issue while classifying mitotic and non-mitotic nuclei in breast cancer histopathology images through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). First, nuclei are segmented out using blue ratio and global binary thresholding. In Phase-1 a CNN is then trained on the segmented out 80×80 pixel patches based on a standard dataset. Hard non-mitotic examples are identified and augmented; mitotic examples are oversampled by rotation and flipping; whereas non-mitotic examples are undersampled by blue ratio histogram based k-means clustering. Based on this information from Phase-1, the dataset is modified for Phase-2 in order to reduce the effects of class imbalance. The proposed CNN architecture and data balancing technique yielded an F-measure of 0.79, and outperformed all the methods relying on specific handcrafted features, as well as those using a combination of handcrafted and CNN-generated features.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we assessed temporal trends and clinical and demographic factors associated with trastuzumab initiation in a large, population-based cohort of patients aged &lt;64 years in 5 states. <b>Methods:</b> Using a cancer registry and claims-linked data set of 13,398 women with incident invasive breast cancer from 2006 to 2011, we identified 934 patients aged &lt;64 years with HER2-positive stage I-III breast cancer. We assessed trastuzumab initiation within the first 9 months after diagnosis and conducted logistic regression analyses to assess sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with trastuzumab initiation. <b>Results:</b> From 2006 to 2011, trastuzumab initiation steadily increased in patients with node-positive (from 65% to 91%) and node-negative (from 39% to 75%) breast cancers. Several tumor-related factors were associated with trastuzumab initiation, including high histologic grades (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.43; 95% CI, 3.27-12.65; and aOR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.66-6.36, for grades 3 and 2, respectively), node-positive status (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.28-2.78; <i>P</i>=.001), tumor size &gt;2 cm (aOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.04-2.16; <i>P</i>=.03), and hormone receptor-negative status (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.26; <i>P</i>=.04). We found a null effect of race. <b>Conclusions:</b> Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for early-stage breast cancer has been widely disseminated among women aged &lt;64 years.

"28476377","2017/05/07 06:00","Nodal metastasis signatures in breast cancer.","<AbstractText>Although the molecular taxonomy of invasive breast cancer is based on heterogeneous histologic types, pathologic nodal (pN) stage remains one of the most important independent prognostic factors. Although node-positive number (NPN) has been widely as an accepted staging algorithm of pN stage, the node-positive ratio (NPR) in totally resected axillary nodes has been considered as another reasonable indicator. We aimed to identify signatures to play a predictive role in nodal metastasis for analytic validation between the primary breast cancers with positive node metastasis and those with negative node metastasis. We validated expression profiles of surrogate candidates extracted from the prior 2D MALDI-TOF data for invasive breast cancer using fluorescence/silver in situ hybridization (FISH/SISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 151 primary breast cancers accompanied with 102 metastatic nodal tissues. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses indicated that event factors (recurrence or metastasis) were significantly more frequent in cases with CCDN1, c-myc gene amplification, IgHA2 low expression. CCDN1 gene amplification (OR: 5.702, p=0.0006), IgHA2 low expression (OR: 0.16, p=0.0184) remained significant factors for events on multivariate analyses. WDR<sup>+</sup>/ERK<sup>++</sup> was significantly detected in higher pN stage (averaging 6.5 regional nodes or 43% of NPR), while seldom found in pN0-1. In conclusion, both overexpression of WDR1 and p-ERK in the primary breast cancer could play a role in the nodal signature over pN2-3.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

She had a history of breast cancer 7 years before. The practitioner, suspecting bone metastases, initiated bone scintigraphy, which showed multiple bone lesions, and referred her to our hospital for further investigations. Laboratory investigations confirmed hypercalcemia but revealed a constellation of primary hyperparathyroidism and not hypercalcemia of malignancy; in the latter condition, a suppressed rather than an increased value of parathyroid hormone would have been expected. A parathyroid adenoma was found and surgically removed. The patient's postoperative course showed a hungry bone syndrome, and brown tumors were suspected. With the background of a previous breast cancer and lytic, partly corticalis-disrupting bone lesions, there was a great concern not to miss a concomitant malignant disease. Biopsies were not diagnostic for either malignancy or brown tumor. Six months after the patient's neck surgery, imaging showed healing of the bone lesions, and bone metastases could be excluded.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">This case shows essential differential diagnosis in a patient with hypercalcemia and multiple bone lesions. Whenever multiple, fluorodeoxyglucose-avid bone lesions are found, malignancy and metabolic bone disease should both be included in the differential diagnosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid and corticalis-disrupting lytic lesions also occur in benign bone disease. There may be very few similar cases with heterogeneous and widespread bone lesions reported in the literature, but we think our patient's case is particularly remarkable for its detailed imaging and the well-documented course.</AbstractText>\n"

"28475599","2017/05/06 06:00","SUSD2 promotes tumor-associated macrophage recruitment by increasing levels of MCP-1 in breast cancer.","<AbstractText>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in tumor angiogenesis and are recruited into the tumor microenvironment (TME) by secreted chemokines, including Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2). Angiogenesis is required to sustain proliferation and enable metastasis of breast cancer (BCa) cells. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of TAM recruitment would allow for the identification of desperately needed novel drug targets. Sushi Domain Containing 2 (SUSD2), a transmembrane protein on BCa cells, was previously shown to promote tumor angiogenesis in a murine model. To identify the role of SUSD2 in angiogenesis, 175 human breast tumors were surveyed by immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of SUSD2 and macrophages. Tumors with high levels of SUSD2 staining contained 2-fold more TAMs, mainly of the M2 pro-angiogenic phenotype. An in vitro co-culture model system was developed by differentiating SC monocytes into SC M0 macrophages. A 2-fold increase in polarized M2 macrophages was observed when M0 macrophages were incubated with SUSD2-expressing BCa cells compared to cancer cells that do not contain SUSD2. Since MCP-1 is known to recruit macrophages, levels of MCP-1 were compared between SUSD2-expressing MDA-MB-231 and MBA-MB-231-vector control cell lines. MCP-1 RNA, intracellular protein and secreted MCP-1 were all significantly increased compared to the vector control. Knockdown of SUSD2 in SKBR3 resulted in significantly decreased levels of secreted MCP-1. Consistently, increased levels of MCP-1 were observed in Susd2-expressing tumors generated from an in vivo isogeneic mouse model compared to the vector control tumors. Because SUSD2 recruits macrophages into the TME and promotes M2 polarization, inhibiting the function of SUSD2 may be an effective therapy for breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"

We included, from the population-based California Cancer Registry, women ages 18 and older with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through December 2013. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total mortality by nSES, race/ethnicity, and tumor subtype. Among 145,564 breast cancer cases, 42.7% were unmarried at the time of diagnosis. In multivariable-adjusted models, the MRR (95% CI) for unmarried compared to married women was 1.28 (1.24-1.32) for total mortality. Significant interactions were observed by race/ethnicity (P&lt;0.001), tumor subtype (P&lt;0.001), and nSES (P = 0.009). Higher MRRs were observed for non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders than for blacks or Hispanics, and for HR+/HER2+ tumors than other subtypes. Assessment of interactive effect between marital status and nSES showed that unmarried women living in low SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of dying compared with married women in high SES neighborhoods (MRR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.53-1.67). Unmarried breast cancer patients have higher total mortality than married patients; the association varies by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and nSES. Unmarried status should be further evaluated as a breast cancer prognostic factor. Identification of underlying causes of the marital status associations is needed to design interventions that could improve survival for unmarried breast cancer patients.</AbstractText>\n"
"28475134","2017/05/06 06:00","Modeling Geospatial Patterns of Late-Stage Diagnosis of Breast Cancer in the US.","<AbstractText>In the US, about one-third of new breast cancers (BCs) are diagnosed at a late stage, where morbidity and mortality burdens are higher. Health outcomes research has focused on the contribution of measures of social support, particularly the residential isolation or segregation index, on propensity to utilize mammography and rates of late-stage diagnoses. Although inconsistent, studies have used various approaches and shown that residential segregation may play an important role in cancer morbidities and mortality. Some have focused on any individuals living in residentially segregated places (place-centered), while others have focused on persons of specific races or ethnicities living in places with high segregation of their own race or ethnicity (person-centered). This paper compares and contrasts these two approaches in the study of predictors of late-stage BC diagnoses in a cross-national study. We use 100% of U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS) Registry data pooled together from 40 states to identify late-stage diagnoses among ~1 million new BC cases diagnosed during 2004-2009. We estimate a multilevel model with person-, county-, and state-level predictors and a random intercept specification to help ensure robust effect estimates. Person-level variables in both models suggest that non-White races or ethnicities have higher odds of late-stage diagnosis, and the odds of late-stage diagnosis decline with age, being highest among the &lt;age 50 group. After controlling statistically for all other factors, we examine place-centered isolation and find for anyone living in an isolated Asian community there is a large beneficial association (suggesting lower odds of late-stage diagnosis) while for anyone living in an isolated White community there is a large detrimental association (suggesting greater odds of late-stage diagnosis). By contrast, living in neighborhoods among others of one's own race or ethnicity (person-centered isolation) is associated with greater odds of late-stage diagnosis, as this measure is dominated by Whites (the majority). At the state level, living in a state that allows unfettered access to a specialist is associated with a somewhat lower likelihood of being diagnosed at a late stage of BC. Geographic factors help explain the likelihood of late-stage BC diagnosis, which varies considerably across the U.S. as heterogeneous compositional and contextual factors portray very different places and potential for improving information and outcomes. The USCS database is expanding to cover more states and is expected to be a valuable resource for ongoing and future place-based cancer outcomes research.</AbstractText>\n"

Our previous study demonstrated that ATP treatment in vitro could promote invasion in human prostate cancer cells via P2Y2, a preferred receptor for ATP, by enhancing EMT process. However, the pro-invasion mechanisms of ATP and P2Y2 are still poorly studied in breast cancer. In this study, we found that P2Y2 was highly expressed in breast cancer cells and associated with human breast cancer metastasis. ATP could promote the in vitro invasion of breast cancer cells and enhance the expression of β-catenin as well as its downstream target genes CD44, c-Myc and cyclin D1, while P2Y2 knockdown attenuated above ATP-driven events in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, iCRT14, a β-catenin/TCF complex inhibitor, could also suppress ATP-driven migration and invasion in vitro. These results suggest that ATP promoted breast cancer cell invasion via P2Y2-β-catenin axis. Thus blockade of the ATP-P2Y2-β-catenin axis could suppress the invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells and may serve as potential targets for therapeutic interventions of breast cancer.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors.

Automated classifiers could substantially upgrade the diagnosis process, in terms of both accuracy and time requirement by distinguishing benign and malignant patterns automatically. Neural network (NN) plays an important role in this respect, especially in the application of breast cancer detection. Despite the large number of publications that describe the utilization of NN in various medical techniques, only a few reviews are available that guide the development of these algorithms to enhance the detection techniques with respect to specificity and sensitivity. The purpose of this review is to analyze the contents of recently published literature with special attention to techniques and states of the art of NN in medical imaging. We discuss the usage of NN in four different medical imaging applications to show that NN is not restricted to few areas of medicine.

However, there are no survival differences between women who obtain intensive surveillance with imaging and laboratory studies compared with women who only undergo testing because of the development of symptoms or findings on clinical examinations. American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that annual mammography is the only imaging examination that should be performed to detect a localized breast recurrence in asymptomatic patients; more imaging may be needed if the patient has locoregional symptoms (eg, palpable abnormality). Women with other risk factors that increase their lifetime risk for breast cancer may warrant evaluation with breast MRI. Furthermore, the quality of life is similar for women who undergo intensive surveillance compared with those who do not. There is little justification for imaging to detect or rule out metastasis in asymptomatic women with newly diagnosed stage I breast cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 American College of Radiology.

To evaluate a screening programme, both benefits and harms should be considered. Published estimates of the benefit-to-harm ratio, the number of breast cancer deaths prevented divided by the number of overdiagnosed breast cancer cases, varied considerably. The objective of the study was to estimate the benefit-to-harm ratio of breast cancer screening in Denmark. The numbers of breast cancer deaths prevented and overdiagnosed cases [invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] were estimated per 1,000 women aged 50-79, using national published estimates for breast cancer mortality and overdiagnosis, and national incidence and mortality rates. Estimations were made for both invited and screened women. Among 1,000 women invited to screening from age 50 to age 69 and followed until age 79, we estimated that 5.4 breast cancer deaths would be prevented and 2.1 cases overdiagnosed, under the observed scenario in Denmark of a breast cancer mortality reduction of 23.4% and 2.3% of the breast cancer cases being overdiagnosed. The estimated benefit-to-harm ratio was 2.6 for invited women and 2.5 for screened women. Hence, 2-3 women would be prevented from dying from breast cancer for every woman overdiagnosed with invasive breast cancer or DCIS. The difference between the previous published ratios and 2.6 for Denmark is probably more a reflection of the accuracy of the underlying estimates than of the actual screening programmes. Therefore, benefit-to-harm ratios should be used cautiously.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

By virtue of the germline mutations that define these syndromes, invasive breast cancers in these patients have unique mechanisms that can be rationally targeted for therapeutic opportunities distinct from standard of care treatments in nongermline mutation associated breast cancers. This review intends to describe existing data on several of the most common hereditary breast cancer syndromes, including BRCA-related breast cancer syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome, specifically focusing on rational therapeutics utilized in these distinct patient subgroups and completed or ongoing clinical trials evaluating their efficacy. By exploiting the distinct biologic features associated with these syndromes, tailored treatment strategies have the potential for improved efficacy and lower toxicity. Knowledge of the emergence of these targeted cancer therapies is critical for appropriate management in these patients, extending beyond treatment to highlight the need for appropriate genetic screening to allow for early recognition of these patients and therefore appropriate treatment.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Molecular testing allows for identification of germline mutations that place individuals at high risk for breast cancer and that are associated with distinct histopathology and molecular characteristics that define the invasive breast cancer cases that these patients develop. These unique characteristics may ultimately provide rational targets for systemic treatments with improvements in both morbidity and efficacy. Identification of patients with these germline mutations is important for not only appropriate screening and prophylaxis, but knowledge of therapies specifically targeting several of the most common hereditary breast cancer syndromes is essential to ensure appropriate treatment of invasive breast cancers in these patients.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© AlphaMed Press 2017.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

In this article, a metastatic tumor of the neck originating from a breast carcinoma, which has been treated 14 years ago, is discussed. A case is presented of a 48-year-old female patient with a history of breast carcinoma, which was surgically treated approximately 14 years ago. Patient was evaluated as glomus vagale because of clinical and radiologic characteristics. The resection of the mass was performed under general anesthesia, without any complications. The diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma was confirmed by histopathologic evaluation. In the differential diagnosis of cervical masses, the cervical metastasis of the breast carcinoma with mimicking clinical presentations should be kept in the mind; especially patients with breast cancer history.</AbstractText>\n"

The tetrahydroisoquinolone trabectedin administered at 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> as a 3-h intravenous infusion every 3 weeks showed activity in patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and BRCA germline mutations, but mainly in BRCA2 carriers. Data from a phase II study were retrospectively analyzed to compare the efficacy and safety of this trabectedin dose and schedule in pretreated MBC patients bearing germline BRCA1/2 mutations. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) by independent expert review. Duration of response (DR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were secondary efficacy endpoints. Safety was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC). Data from 26 BRCA1-mutated and 13 BRCA2-mutated patients were analyzed. 69% of BRCA1-mutated cancers were triple-negative vs. 31% of BRCA2-mutated ones. 77% of BRCA1 and 31% of BRCA2 carriers were platinum-pretreated. The ORR in BRCA2-mutated patients was higher than in BRCA1-mutated patients (33.3% vs. 9.1%). DR ranged for 1.4-6.8 months in BRCA2-mutated patients and for 1.5-1.7 months in BRCA1-mutated patients. More BRCA2-mutated patients had disease stabilization for ≥4 months (25.0% vs. 9.1%) and their median PFS was longer (4.7 vs. 2.5 months). Trabectedin was well tolerated in both patient subtypes. In conclusion, trabectedin showed higher antitumor activity in relapsed MBC patients with germline BRCA2 mutations than in those with BRCA1 mutations.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, how DKK2 contributes to breast tumorigenesis remains unclear. We examined its expression and promoter methylation in 10 breast tumor cell lines, 98 primary tumors, and 21 normal breast tissues. Compared with normal tissues, DKK2 was frequently silenced in breast cell lines (7/8). DKK2 promoter methylation was detected in 77.8% of cell lines and 86.7% of breast tumors; while rarely detected in normal breast tissues (19%), indicating common DKK2 methylation in breast cancer. Ectopic expression of DKK2 changed breast tumor cell morphology, inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and suppressed tumor cell migration by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and downregulating stem cell markers. Moreover, restored expression of DKK2 in MCF7 cells disrupted the microtube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells on Matrigel®. In vivo, the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice was markedly decreased after stable expression of DKK2. DKK2 suppressed canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inhibiting β-catenin activity with decreased active β-catenin protein. Thus, our findings demonstrate that DKK2 functions as a tumor suppressor through inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis via regulating Wnt signaling during breast tumorigenesis.</AbstractText>\n"

Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant prospective study, 17 women (age range, 45-70 years) scheduled to undergo neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer underwent ultrasonography (US) immediately before therapy and at completion of 10%, 60%, and 100% of chemotherapy. All patients provided written informed consent. At each examination, radiofrequency data were collected from SHAPE and subharmonic imaging during infusion of a US contrast agent. Maximum-frequency magnitude and mean intensity were calculated for SHAPE and subharmonic imaging. The signal differences in the tumor relative to the surrounding area were compared with the final treatment response by using the Student t test. Results Four patients left the study, and data from two patients were discarded because of technical problems. Eight patients completed the entire imaging protocol, and an additional three patients dropped out after the imaging session at completion of 10% of chemotherapy as a result of disease progression (these patients were counted as nonresponders). Patients' imaging outcomes consisted of six responders (tumor volume reduction &gt;90%) and five partial responders or nonresponders. The results at completion of 10% of therapy showed that the subharmonic signal increased more in the tumor than in the surrounding area for responders than in partial responders or nonresponders (mean ± standard deviation, 3.23 dB ± 1.41 vs -0.88 dB ± 1.46 [P = .001], respectively, for SHAPE and 1.32 dB ± 0.73 vs -0.82 dB ± 0.88 [P = .002], respectively, for subharmonic imaging). Moreover, three patients whose tumor measurements initially increased were correctly predicted to be responders with SHAPE and subharmonic imaging after completion of 10% of therapy. Conclusion SHAPE and subharmonic imaging have the potential to help predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer as early as completion of 10% of therapy, albeit on the basis of a small sample size. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.</AbstractText>\n"

E2F4 individual regulatory activity scores were calculated for 1129 patient samples across 5 independent breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy datasets. Accuracy of the E2F4 signature in predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response was compared to that of the Oncotype DX and MammaPrint predictive signatures.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">In all datasets, E2F4 activity level was an accurate predictor of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, with high E2F4 scores predictive of achieving pathologic complete response and low scores predictive of residual disease. These results remained significant even after stratifying patients by estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor stage, and breast cancer molecular subtypes. Compared to the Oncotype DX and MammaPrint signatures, our E2F4 signature achieved similar performance in predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, though all signatures performed better in ER+ tumors compared to ER- ones. The accuracy of our signature was reproducible across datasets and was maintained when refined from a 199-gene signature down to a clinic-friendly 33-gene panel.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\">Overall, we show that our E2F4 signature is accurate in predicting patient response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Although the antibody trastuzumab, which targets the HER2 growth factor receptor, has improved survival rates, patients often present with de novo resistance or acquire resistance after an initial response. Identifying new ways to target HER2 signaling will be critical for overcoming trastuzumab resistance. FAM83A is a novel oncogene identified by its ability to confer resistance to EGFR therapies, a receptor closely related to HER2. Moreover, a prior study identified hyper-tyrosine phosphorylated FAM83A in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ BC. Here, we find that FAM83A expression is elevated in 36% of HER2+ BC tumors. In a panel of HER2+ BC cell lines, FAM83A expression is significantly increased in the trastuzumab-resistant derivatives relative to parental controls. shRNA-mediated ablation of FAM83A in the panel of HER2+ BC cell lines suppresses HER2+ BC cell growth in both 2D and 3D cell cultures, elevates apoptosis markers, and suppresses PI3K signaling. Growth inhibition following FAM83A knock-down, however, was independent of trastuzumab sensitivity, suggesting that FAM83A is a key signaling component in HER2+ BCs that could serve as a novel therapeutic target in both trastuzumab-resistant and trastuzumab-sensitive cancers.</AbstractText>\n"

In order to develop novel selective ERα modulators (SERMs), we designed and synthesized 18 novel 3-aryl-4-anilino-2H-chromen-2-one derivatives based on previously reported lead compounds. The biological results indicated that most of the compounds presented potent ERα binding affinity and possessed better anti-proliferative activities against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cell lines than the positive control tamoxifen. The piperidyl substituted compounds such as 16d and 18d demonstrated strong ERα binding affinities and excellent anti-proliferative activities respectively. Compound 18d displayed the most potent ERα binding affinity with RBA value of 2.83%, while 16d exhibited the best anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.52±2.47μM. Further molecular docking studies were also carried out to investigate binding pattern of the newly synthesized compounds with ERα. All these results together with the structure-activity relationships (SARs) indicated that these 3-aryl-4-anilino-2H-chromen-2-one derivatives with basic side chain could serve as promising leads for further optimization as novel SERMs.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Current barriers to successful treatment of IBC include frequent infiltration and the presence of tumor cell clusters, termed tumor emboli, within the breast parenchyma and lymphatics. Prior studies have identified the role of anti-apoptotic signaling, in particular hyperactivation of NFκB and its target genes, in IBC pathobiology and therapeutic resistance. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if IBC tumor emboli express anti-apoptotic proteins and (2) develop a high content, multiparametric assay to assess the morphology of the IBC 3D spheroids and to optimize a high throughput format to screen for compounds that can inhibit the formation of the IBC tumor clusters/embolic structures. Immunohistochemical analysis of IBC patient tumor samples with documented tumor emboli revealed high NFκB (p65) staining along with expression of XIAP, a potent anti-apoptotic protein known to interact with NFκB signaling in enhancing survival of malignant cells. Subsequently, the high content assay developed allowed for simultaneous imaging and morphometric analysis, including count and viability of spheroids derived from SUM149, rSUM149 and SUM190 cells and its application to evaluate XIAP and NFκB inhibitory agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of the off-patent drug disulfiram when chelated with copper, which we had previously reported to inhibit NFκB signaling, was highly effective in disrupting both IBC spheroids and emboli grown in vitro. Taken together, these results identify a high-throughput approach to target tumor spheroid formation for drug discovery. Finally, disulfiram is a safe and approved drug for management of alcohol abuse, warranting its evaluation for repurposing in IBC therapy.</AbstractText>\n"

It is overexpressed in various human cancers and employed as a promising target in cancer therapy. We discovered a benzoxazole scaffold through virtual high-throughput screening, and designed, synthesized 24 derivatives and investigated for inhibition of G9a. After several rounds of kinase and anti-proliferative activity screening, we discovered a potent G9a antagonist (GA001) with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.32μM that could induce autophagy via AMPK in MCF7 cells. In addition, we found high concentration of GA001 could induce apoptosis via p21-Bim signal cascades in MCF7 cells.

Also, to examine associations with disease-related and sociodemographic factors among those with breast cancer. Methods Longitudinal register data on 3,547 women living in Sweden (age 20 to 65 years) who were first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, and a matched comparison cohort (n = 14,188), were analyzed for the annual prevalence of diagnosis-specific sickness absence and disability pension over 5 years. Logistic regressions were used to explore associations of disease-related and sociodemographic factors with future sickness absence and disability pension among women with breast cancer. Results Immediately after being diagnosed with breast cancer, the proportion of women with sickness absence was high but decreased continuously from the 1st through 5th year after diagnosis (71%, 40%, 30%, 22%, and 19%, respectively). In comparison, the range for women without breast cancer was 17% to 11%, respectively. The higher prevalence of sickness absence after breast cancer was mainly a result of breast cancer diagnosis, not a mental diagnosis, or other somatic diagnoses. Advanced cancer at diagnosis, &gt; 90 days sickness absence before diagnosis, low education, and being born outside Sweden were associated with higher odds ratios for sickness absence and disability pension (odds ratio range, 1.40 to 6.45). Conclusion The level of sickness absence increased substantially in women with breast cancer during the first year after diagnosis and approached the level of breast cancer-free women in the following years; however, even in the first year, most women were not on sickness absence for a substantial time, and even in high-risk groups, many were not on sickness absence or disability pension in the following years. Information about relatively low future sickness absence and disability pension levels can be used by patients when planning their work, by health care professionals, and by social insurance officers. Employers and Occupational Health Services need this information to adequately handle workplace adjustments.</AbstractText>\n"

A total of 164 metastatic breast cancer patients in Shanxi Cancer Hospital were recruited between February 2016 and July 2016. 200 breast cancer patients without metastasis in the same period were randomly selected as the control group. The general characteristics, immunohistochemical, and pathological results were investigated between the two groups, and tumor markers were determined. There were statistical differences in the concentration and the positive rates of CEA, CA19-9, CA125, CA15-3, and TPS between the MBC and control group (P&lt;0.05). The highest sensitivity was in CEA and the highest specificity was in CA125 for the diagnosis of MBC when using a single tumor marker at 56.7% and 97.0%, respectively.

Our aim was therefore to assess the long-term effect of screening by age and time of implementation. We obtained data on 69,630 breast cancer deaths between 1980 and 2010 by municipality (N = 431) and age of death (40-79) in the Netherlands. Breast cancer mortality trends were analyzed by defining the municipality-specific calendar year of introduction of screening as Year 0. Additionally, log-linear Poisson regression was used to estimate the turning point in the trend after Year 0, per municipality, and the annual percentage change (APC) before and after this point. Twenty years after introduction of screening breast cancer mortality was reduced by 30% in women aged 55-74 and by 34% in women aged 75-79, compared to Year 0. A similar and significant decrease was present in municipalities that started early (1987-1992) and late (1995-1997) with screening, despite the difference in availability of effective adjuvant treatment. In the age groups 55-74 and 75-79, the turning point in the trend in breast cancer mortality was estimated in Years 2 and 6 after the introduction of screening, respectively, after which mortality decreased significantly by 1.9% and 2.6% annually. These findings show that the implementation of mammography screening in Dutch municipalities is associated with a significant decline in breast cancer mortality in women aged 55-79, irrespective of time of implementation.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 UICC.</CopyrightInformation>\n"

The detection of unsuspected distant metastases in these patients alters treatment and prognosis.

Here, we report evidence highlighting the cell-cycle-related kinase CDK7 as a driver and candidate therapeutic target in TNBC. Using publicly available transcriptomic data from a collated set of TNBC patients (<i>n</i> = 383) and the METABRIC TNBC dataset (<i>n</i> = 217), we found <i>CDK7</i> mRNA levels to be correlated with patient prognosis. High CDK7 protein expression was associated with poor prognosis within the RATHER TNBC cohort (<i>n</i> = 109) and the METABRIC TNBC cohort (<i>n</i> = 203). The highly specific CDK7 kinase inhibitors, BS-181 and THZ1, each downregulated CDK7-mediated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicative of transcriptional inhibition, with THZ1 exhibiting 500-fold greater potency than BS-181. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the survival of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells relied heavily on the BCL-2/BCL-XL signaling axes in cells. Accordingly, we found that combining the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors ABT-263/ABT199 with the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 synergized in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis of human TNBC cells. Collectively, our results highlight elevated CDK7 expression as a candidate biomarker of poor prognosis in TNBC, and they offer a preclinical proof of concept for combining CDK7 and BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors as a mechanism-based therapeutic strategy to improve TNBC treatment. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3834-45. ©2017 AACR</i>.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</CopyrightInformation>\n"
