development of early biomarkers that could\\nprovide prognostic information regarding treatment response\\nand disease progression \\nAt present  evaluation of the metabolic tumor burden in BC is\\n\\ndependent on serum markers  including Cancer Antigen 15-3\\n CA15-3  and Carcinoembryonic Antigen  CEA  The major\\nissues with using these markers  however  are a lack of sensitivity\\nand

cfDNA is derived from apoptotic cells and is\\n\\nted  measuring 185 to 200 base pairs  bp  in length \\nas in cancer patients it results from apoptotic and necrotic\\n\\ncells [7 8] Therefore

cancer-related deaths among Japanese\\n\\nwomen 2 Globally  between 5% and 10% of breast cancers are meta-\\n\\nstatic at the time of diagnosis 3 and ABC  including recurrent disease\\n\\nand mBC  is incurable 4 posing a significant public health burden and\\n\\nconsiderable treatment challenges 5\\n\\nFor postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC  endocrine therapy\\n\\nwith agents such as aromatase inhibitors  eg  anastrozole  letrozole \\n\\nor exemestane  is the standard first-line treatment6 and is recom-\\n\\nmended by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guide-\\n\\nlines 7 However  current first-line endocrine therapy alone may\\n\\nprovide only modest benefit in patients with HR+ ABC  and some\\n\\npatients may not respond at all 6 indicating the need for new treat-\\n\\nment options  In a randomized phase III trial of exemestane vs anas-\\n\\ntrozole as first-line therapy in Japanese women with HR+ ABC \\n\\nmedian time to progression was approximately 12 months in each\\n\\ngroup 8 Thus  there is interest in improving outcomes by combining\\n\\nfirst-line endocrine therapy with other agents \\n\\nPalbociclib is a potent  orally active  highly selective inhibitor of\\n\\nCDK4/6  it actively arrests cell cycle progression from the G1 phase\\n\\nto the S phase to inhibit DNA synthesis and the pathologic cellular\\n\\nproliferation characteristic of

lack data from Latin populations\\nof Hispanic origin  In this pilot study  metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed\\nto establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC  Data\\nfrom 1H-NMR  GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared  Statistics showed dis-\\ncrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms  The dif-\\nferentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid  amino acid and\\nfatty acid metabolism  This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches\\nin metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabo-\\nlism  Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better\\nunderstanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic\\norigin  Particularly  the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines\\nand the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid  cPA  In addition  the mapped meta-\\nbolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-His-\\npanic women  despite racial differences \\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer  BC  remains the most frequent type of cancer and the main cause of cancer\\n\\ndeaths among women worldwide [1]  According to GLOBOCAN  breast cancer

with genes and proteins \\n\\nMetabolomics is a consolidated field that has enabled to observe differences in metabolic\\n\\nsignatures generated by a pathological state such as cancer  These differences allow to postulate\\n\\nmolecular mechanisms involved in cancer  proposing and evaluating promissory treatment\\n\\ntargets and diagnosis tools [8–10]  Although the identification of breast cancer biomarkers by\\n\\nmetabolomics is still at an early stage  exploratory studies have allowed highlighting alterations\\n\\nin aerobic glycolysis  de novo lipogenesis  glutaminolysis  glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid\\nand amino acid metabolism [11–15]  These alterations have been used to identify metabolic\\n\\nchanges associated with advanced metastatic breast cancer in cell lines [16  17] and serum\\n\\n[18]  as well as breast cancer subtypes in plasma [13  19] and tissue [13  19–21]  Moreover  the\\n\\nidentification of suitable targets for drug development in cell lines [22–24] and therapy selec-\\n\\ntion in cell lines [25] and serum [26] have also been achieved \\n\\nHigh-throughput analytical chemical techniques such as chromatography coupled to mass\\n\\nspectrometry  MS  and nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  spectroscopy [27  28] have been\\n\\nused in metabolomics  along with univariate and multivariate statistics [29  30]  in order to\\n\\nprovide information on a large number of metabolites  in particular those with altered levels\\n\\nbetween healthy subjects and cancer patients [9  31–34]  Metabolomics in BC has been mainly\\n\\nperformed by NMR and MS  according to the purpose of the study and the characteristics of\\n\\nmeasured metabolites [35]  NMR has proven useful to determine significant differences in\\n\\nserum samples  allowing a discrimination between early and metastatic BC  regarding to\\n\\namino acid  small organic molecules and general lipid content [26  36  37]  and also to predict\\n\\nBC recurrence using amino acid  fatty acid and choline levels [38]  Both GC-MS and LC-MS\\n\\nhave detected alterations that have been proposed for several biomarkers  including amino\\n\\nacids [38–41]  small organic acids [13  38] and fatty acids [26  38]  whereas lysophospholipid\\n\\n[42  43] and carnitine [13] alterations have been found only by LC-MS  In addition  alterations\\n\\nin less polar lipids  such as glycerophospholipids [42  44  45] and glycerolipids [43  46] have\\n\\nbeen reported by LC-MS using a lipidomics approach \\n\\nIn last decades  extensive research in breast cancer has been conducted in order to under-\\n\\nstand its heterogeneity  however a comprehensive metabolic profile is still required to identify\\n\\npromising underlying metabolic signatures that can be used to improve breast cancer diagno-\\n\\nsis and treatment  Besides  most studies of metabolic alterations in BC have been performed\\n\\non Asian  European and North American women  little is known about the metabolic signa-\\n\\nture of BC in women from developing regions  In the present pilot study  a multiplatform\\n\\nmetabolomic and

The\\npresent study proposes to use ensembles of Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks  The\\nsearch for a high quality ensemble is directed by a fitness function that incorporates the\\naccuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself  The\\nensemble approach is tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets \\none on Breast Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease  using a 10-fold cross-validation\\nstrategy  Our experimental results show that  for the first dataset  the performance was simi-\\nlar to previous studies reported in literature  On the second dataset  the Evolutionary Wave-\\nlet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous methods  The third\\ndataset is relatively new and this study is the first to report benchmark results \\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Australian women [1] \\n\\nwhile Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurological condition in Australia [2] \\n\\nThe identification and assessment process for both diseases is multi-staged  that is tedious \\n\\ntime-consuming  and challenging where data needs to be manually labeled  Such assessments\\n\\nmight also lead to misdiagnosis  In medical practice  in order to reduce the risk of misdiagno-\\n\\nsis  opinions from multiple doctors  or specialist doctors  are taken into account  A similar\\n\\napproach is used in the computational intelligence domain  where performance of prediction\\n\\nmodels  or specialist models  is improved by combining multiple models  thus creating an\\n\\nensemble of classifiers [3] \\n\\nEnsemble classifiers and their use have been an active area of research for the past two\\n\\ndecades  with Bagging [3] and Boosting [4]

disease classi-\\n\\nfication [15]  However  there have been no studies on the prediction performance of an ensem-\\n\\nble of EWNN classifiers  yet \\n\\nThe motivation of this research is to evaluate the performance of EWNN and ensembles of\\n\\nEWNNs  EWNN-e  and compare them with other ensemble techniques used on the same\\n\\ndata reported in literature  The findings of this paper aim to provide future researchers an\\n\\nalternative and effective model to compare with  Moreover  this study also investigates a newly\\n\\npublished Parkinson’s disease dataset with multiple speech recordings \\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows  Background provides an overview to Wavelet Neural\\n\\nNetworks and its structure  EWNN and its response to a two-spiral task  related work on prun-\\n\\ning ensembles  and description of some of the performance measures used in our study  The\\n\\nbiomedical datasets  proposed mechanism and the experimental setup are described in the\\n\\nExperimental Methodology section  Results &amp; Discussion presents the outcome of experiments\\n\\nand compares the method’s effectiveness with other techniques reported in literature  That sec-\\n\\ntion is then followed by the conclusions and future work \\n\\nBackground\\nWavelet Neural Networks\\n\\nWavelet Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that combine the theory of wavelets\\n\\nand neural networks [16]  In standard neural networks  weights and biases are the only param-\\n\\neters that are trained and the most common activation functions used are sigmoid  hyperbolic\\n\\ntangent and linear functions  The activation functions found in WNNs are those that belong to\\n\\nthe family of wavelet basis functions  with the most common being the Morelet and Mexican\\nhat  In addition to weights and biases  three other parameters are used in WNNs  translate \\ndilate and rotate  The use of standard gradient methods to adjust WNN parameters  in particu-\\n\\nlar the weights  biases  the translate and dilate parameters  often resulted in premature conver-\\n\\ngence [16  17]  For that reason  global optimization approaches  such as genetic algorithms\\n\\nand evolutionary programming techniques  have been used in applications such as air and\\n\\nground traffic flow [18  19]  energy consumption [20]  large scale function estimation [21] \\n\\nfunction approximation [22] and power transformer monitoring [23]  A diagram of a WNN is\\n\\nshown in Fig 1  WNNs generally have a feed-forward structure  with one hidden layer having\\n\\nm wavelons  ψm  and a neuron in the output layer  There are also n shortcut connections from\\nthe inputs to the output neuron \\n\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks\\n\\nEWNNs were first proposed by Khan et al  [15] as a method for optimizing all WNN parame-\\n\\nters concurrently  The method was tested successfully on both simulated and real datasets [15] \\n\\nFor a detailed description of EWNN characteristics and performance  we refer the reader to\\n\\nreference [15] \\n\\nFig 2 is an example of the EWNN applied to a standard benchmark two-spiral task shown\\n\\nin Fig 2 a  Two-spiral

 While in [26] a 2-50-1 ANN was trained by employing a\\n\\nsecond-order Newton optimization method where training took only 650 epochs  In contrast \\n\\nfor EWNNs with a wavelet activation function of Morelet shown in Fig 2 b  the optimum\\n\\nresponse of the EWNNs was achieved within 9 generations and with two wavelons only  This\\n\\nindicates its potential to separate non-linear classes effectively and efficiently \\n\\nClassifier ensembles and pruning\\n\\nThe role of a classifier C is to learn how to map the feature set to a set of class label s  The data\\nsamples are divided into training U and test V sets  The C is first trained on U where it learns\\nthe mapping process and then the performance of the C is measured on V  A multiple classifier\\nsystem  or ensemble  Ens  is composed of a set of base classifiers that are trained on the same\\ntraining dataset  and combined in a manner that improves the classification performance of\\n\\nthe system  There are two main methods for creating an ensemble  averaging and voting [27] \\n\\nAveraging is normally used for classifiers with numeric outputs  While voting is used for\\n\\nFig 1  Structure of a Wavelet Neural

to the same task—reducing ensemble sizes  Pruned ensembles exhibit\\n\\nbetter performance and robustness with lower computational and memory costs [28]  com-\\n\\npared to traditional ensemble techniques [29  30]  The three most popular ensemble pruning\\n\\ntechniques are ranking  clustering and optimization [31]  and this study focuses on the latter \\n\\nAmong the optimization techniques for ensemble pruning the most commonly used are evolu-\\n\\ntionary algorithms  semi-definite programming and hill climbing [32–34] \\n\\nGASEN-b was one of the earliest algorithms for ensemble pruning  and was introduced by\\n\\n[32]  The ensemble is represented as a bit string  with each decision tree model using a bit  The\\n\\nbit string representation provides a direct mechanism of adding or removing classifiers  as\\n\\nopposed to a weighting mechanism with a predefined threshold  A similar approach was also\\n\\nused in [6] to select/remove classifiers from a heterogeneous pool of networks \\n\\nZhang et al  [33] chose a quadratic integer programming approach for pruning  The weights\\n\\nwere kept binary and the size of the final ensemble was prefixed  In terms of computational\\n\\ncomplexity  the algorithm could run in polynomial time \\n\\nHill climbing methods generally use either forward selection or backward elimination of\\n\\nclassifiers  and include various performance measures  e g  diversity  weighted accuracy [35–\\n\\n39]  More recently  human-like foresight has been used as a measure to prune ensembles via\\n\\nhill climbing [34] \\n\\nIn this study  a pool of optimized EWNNs is pruned using genetic algorithms so that a\\n\\nbetter prediction model is obtained  The approach follows the GASEN-b mechanism [32]\\n\\nof pruning classifiers

individual classifier  and the ensemble accuracy using the\\n\\nvoting method \\n\\nNetwork performance measures\\n\\nThere are many performance measures for binary classification problems available in the liter-\\n\\nature  Power [40] investigated those measures and generalized them for multiclass problems \\n\\nNext  we present the measures used in this work \\n\\n• Training Accuracy  Tracc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the training set U \\n\\n• Test Accuracy  Teacc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the test set V  This is also\\nknown as the classification accuracy  and expressed as Teacc =  TP + TN / P + N  TP repre-\\nsents true positive cases  i e  accurate classification of control  non-diseased  samples  TN\\n\\nrepresents true negative cases  i e

cases  mathematically\\nexpressed as Sens = TP/ TP + FN  FN is the number of false negatives and reflects the more\\nserious mistake of classifying a disease sample as control \\n\\n• Specificity  Spec  measurement of the fraction of true negative cases  mathematically repre-\\nsented as Spec = TN/ TN + FP  FP reflects the misclassification of control samples as dis-\\neased ones \\n\\n•

by two experienced radiologists \\n\\nFor analysis  these markings are represented as chain codes and hence can be extracted easily \\n\\nIn the dataset used by [48]  200 mammographic images scanned by a HOWTEK scanner at\\n\\n43 5 micron per pixel spatial resolution were downloaded and extracted via the chain code \\n\\nThat dataset had an equal number of benign and malignant samples  Even though [48] derived\\n\\n25 features from the extracted region  only 6 of the features were actually investigated in the\\n\\npresent study  in order to provide a fair comparison with previous works that used the same\\n\\ndataset [11  49]  Among those 6 features  there are 4 BIRADS  Breast Imaging Reporting and\\n\\nData System established by [50]  lexicon features  mass shape  mass margin

Dataset  LPD  This dataset  available at  http //archive ics uci edu/\\n\\nml  was acquired from the online machine learning database repository from the University of\\n\\nCalifornia at Irvine  UCI

\\n\\nTraining and test sets\\n\\nFor all the datasets  the data was divided into 90% training and 10% test data  The proposed\\n\\napproach is divided into two main phases as shown in Fig 3  Phase I creates optimal EWNNs\\n\\nfrom cross validation folds conducted on the 90% training and validation data and the average\\n\\nclassification accuracy Teacc for the EWNNs was reported  The optimal EWNNs were then\\nused by next phase  Phase II uses genetic algorithm to prune the optimal EWNN classifiers\\n\\nwhere the separate test set was used and a final ensemble classification accuracy ETeacc was\\nthen reported \\n\\nIn both LPD and SPD datasets  individuals had different numbers of records  Thus  if more\\n\\nthan half of the individual’s records are classified as Parkinson’s disease  then the individual\\n\\nitself is classified as Parkinson’s disease  diseased  This approach was adopted from [45  54] in\\n\\norder to avoid over-fitting  as the frequency response of the records of the same patient are\\n\\npotentially very similar \\n\\nApproach\\n\\nPhase I  Generating optimized EWNNs \\n\\n1  EWNN initialization  An EWNN genome requires the initialization of the number of wave-\\n\\nlons  the different parameters of each wavelon  and the wavelet function s \\n\\n• The number of wavelons is critical as too many wavelons would likely result in over-fitting\\n\\nand too few would not capture the variability of the data [56]  The three datasets have been\\n\\ninvestigated in detail under different parameter settings and those are reported in [15] \\n\\nThe best configurations from that study were adopted here  The number of wavelons used\\n\\nfor each dataset is shown in Table 2 \\n\\n• Selection of an appropriate activation function depends on the data itself  but the Mexican\\n\\nhat wavelet has performed satisfactorily in many applications [56]  For the DDSM  the\\n\\npresent study uses a heterogeneous WNN with four possible activation functions  For the\\n\\nremaining case studies  we used a homogeneous WNN that uses the Mexican hat wavelet\\n\\nas activation function \\n\\n• Each wavelon is represented by matrices of

input weights  wavelon\\n\\nweights  translation  rotation  dilation parameters and the bias  values are perturbed by add-\\n\\ning a small percentage of the current value  For binary parameters  e g  switch  the value is\\n\\ninverted from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0  For the third type of mutation  a network input is randomly\\n\\nchanged to another input feature in the feature list  or similarly  a wavelet function is ran-\\n\\ndomly changed to another wavelet function in the list \\n\\n5  Termination condition  The simulations stop at 2 000 generations  We observed that this\\n\\nvalue is sufficient for the evolutionary process to converge to a high-quality solution  The\\n\\noptimal EWNNs are later used in Phase II to create the ensembles  A total of 50 indepen-\\n\\ndent evolutionary runs were executed for each of the cross-validation folds \\n\\nPhase II  Genetic algorithm-based ensemble \\n\\nGiven the set of optimized EWNN ensembles  the next step is to prune them  This stage uses\\n\\nanother genetic algorithm as follows \\n\\n1  Chromosome Chr representation  A k-bit string is used to represent an ensemble with the\\noptimized EWNNs  A bit value of 1 indicates that the classifier is actively used in the ensem-\\n\\nble  0 otherwise \\n\\n2  Population size  After a number of preliminary tests  we decided for an  μ+λ -evolutionary\\nstrategy with μ = 3 parents and λ = 25 offspring in each generation  For ensemble pruning \\nhaving 3 parents considerably reduced the risk of premature convergence and at the same\\n\\ntime kept the evolutionary process under a reasonable selective pressure \\n\\n3  Fitness evaluation  The fitness value of each chromosome is evaluated as in Eq 2  It is an\\n\\naverage of the individual accuracies Tracc of the active EWNNs and their ensemble training\\naccuracy Ens U  where the objective is to maximize the average accuracies \\n\\nFEðChrÞ ¼ 0 5ðTracc þ EnsðUÞÞ ð2Þ\\n\\n4  Mutation  After pilot tests  mutation rate was set to 1% for all simulations  and the strategy\\n\\nused was bit-swap \\n\\n5  Termination condition  The limit for the number of generations was set at 1 000  Ensemble\\n\\naccuracy was found not to improve after few hundred generations \\n\\nThe program starts with random chromosomes that are evaluated based on the fitness func-\\n\\ntion in Eq 2  The best individuals are selected as parents and thus preserved for the next gener-\\n\\nation—all other individuals are removed  Then  λ offspring are produced by mutating the\\nparents  Every offspring is evaluated and added to the next generation

Teacc vs  ETeacc  compared to individual EWNN classifiers  For the\\nDDSM dataset  the ensemble approach improved the performance of the network from 89 0%\\n\\nto 95 5%  An MCC score of 91 0% also indicates a very high classification accuracy  For the\\n\\nLPD dataset the accuracy increased from 92 9% to 100%  and for the SPD dataset it increased\\n\\nfrom 66 3% to 90 0% \\n\\nWhat were the significant features identified by the process  Fig 4 is the averaged connected\\n\\nfeatures for all datasets  across 50 independent runs in EWNN  and the number of active classi-\\n\\nfiers in the EWNN-e  In a standard WNN all features are connected to every wavelons in the\\n\\nhidden layer  While in EWNNs  from Fig 4  there is some variability in how often these fea-\\n\\ntures are connected  This indicates the flexibility of pruning features  during training  at the\\n\\nhidden layer  as opposed to the input layer  for which many feature reduction methods already\\n\\nexist  For the DDSM dataset  mass margin  patient age  mass shape and assessment were the top\\nfour features that had an impact on performance—similarly to [48]  For the LPD dataset \\n\\nspread1 and D2 were the top two features—similarly to [53]  The trend of feature selection was\\nfound to be same for both the EWNN and EWNN-e networks for all datasets except SPD  For\\n\\nthe SPD dataset  Shimmerapq3 is the top feature in the ensemble network  whereas Shimmerdda\\nis the top one for the individual EWNNs  This drift in frequency of feature selection indicates\\n\\npossible significance of the feature in the ensemble domain \\n\\nShould every wavelon be fully connected  The connectivity or dimensionality of a wavelon\\n\\nis determined by the number of active or connected inputs  Fig 5 displays the sum of the wave-\\n\\nlons’ dimensions for each dataset  over 50 independent runs and  over the number of active\\n\\nclassifiers in the final EWNN-e  across the 10 folds  The frequency of each wavelon dimension\\n\\nis lower in the ensemble network  as classifiers are pruned  The ensemble networks exhibited\\n\\ndifferent trends  depending on the dataset  Interestingly  for the DDSM dataset we observed a\\n\\nreduction in the number of 6-dimensional wavelons  thus indicating that fully connected\\n\\nEWNNs were not part of the ensemble network  The frequent occurrence of wavelons with\\n\\nlower dimensions indicates that WNNs should be given the flexibility to adjust their input  in\\n\\ncontrast to a standard WNNs  where all inputs are connected [16] \\n\\nHow many classifiers are necessary to create an effective ensemble  The average number of\\n\\nEWNNs in the ensemble networks for the datasets is shown in Table 4  The ensemble networks\\n\\ncombine around 1/3  14-17  of the 50 available EWNNs  and they improved both speed and\\n\\nperformance  compared to the non-ensemble approach \\n\\nFrom Table 5  it can be concluded that the proposed method generated either competitive\\n\\nor better results in comparison to existing techniques  An advantage of EWNN-e is that it does\\n\\nnot require pre-processing for feature pruning  which is present in some of the comparison\\n\\nmethods  Given the results  it can be stated that the ensemble version of EWNN classifiers is a\\n\\nsuitable approach for predictive analysis  Just for clarification purposes  and to put the results\\n\\ninto context  for the DDSM dataset  the accuracy reported for NN-e was achieved with an\\n\\nensemble of 127 classifiers [11]  as opposed to the average of only 14 50 in the proposed\\n\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease prediction\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0192192 February 8  2018 9 /

among\\\\nn Korea [1] Owing to the advances in systemic therapies \\\\n\\\\nincluding intensive local treatment  chemotherapy  endocrine\\\\ntherapy  and targeted therapy  overall survival rates of breast\\\\ncancer have increased  however  these therapies have not\\\\nproduced signiﬁcant changes in the prognosis of patients with\\\\nbreast cancer accompanied by distant metastasis \\\\nThe main sites of metastasis for breast cancer are the bone \\\\n\\\\nlung  and liver  whereas metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is\\\\nrelatively rare  reported incidence rates are 2% to 18% of breast\\\\ncancer cases  Importantly  gastric metastasis from invasive\\\\nlobular breast carcinoma is reported to occur at a higher rate\\\\nthan the metastasis from invasive ductal carcinoma [2] Gastric\\\\ncancer has high incidence rates in Korea [1] and differentiation\\\\nbetween primary gastric cancer and metastatic gastric cancer\\\\nbased solely on clinical ﬁndings may be difﬁcult  Inappropriate\\\\ndiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical procedures \\\\nIn the present study  we report a case of gastric metastasis from\\\\n\\\\ninvasive lobular breast cancer  which can be

the sensitivity of PET is high for papillary or ductal\\\\na and poorly differentiated solid adenocarcinoma  high\\\\native rates are reported for signet ring cell carcinoma and\\\\nifferentiated

comprehensive\\\\ntreatment have been implemented  the 5-year survival rate\\\\namong patients with BC who develop metastatic disease is only\\\\n24% [2] To improve the clinical outcome of patients  there is an\\\\nurgent need for the development of early biomarkers that could\\\\nprovide prognostic information regarding treatment response\\\\nand disease progression \\\\nAt present  evaluation of the metabolic tumor burden in BC is\\\\n\\\\ndependent on serum markers  including Cancer Antigen 15-3\\\\n CA15-3  and Carcinoembryonic Antigen  CEA  The major\\\\nissues with using these markers  however  are a lack of sensitivity\\\\nand speciﬁcity  especially in early or localized disease [3 4]\\\\n\\\\nTherefore  in recent years  much effort has been devoted to the\\\\ndetection and characterization of circulating cell-free DNA\\\\n cfDNA  in BC  cfDNA is nucleic acid fragments that circulate in\\\\nthe plasma  serum  and other bodily ﬂuids outside of cells  The\\\\nﬁrst report was by Mandel and Metais in 1948 [5] but the topic\\\\nattracted little attention in the scientiﬁc community  It was not\\\\nuntil 1977 that cfDNA was recognized as a useful tool for\\\\nmonitoring the effects of therapy in cancer patients [6] In healthy\\\\nindividuals  cfDNA is derived from apoptotic cells and is\\\\n\\\\nted  measuring 185 to 200 base pairs  bp  in length \\\\nas in cancer patients it results from apoptotic and necrotic\\\\n\\\\ncells [7 8] Therefore  elevated levels of long DNA fragments may\\\\n\\\\nonio Palazón-Bru \\\\n\\\\nare joint ﬁrst authors and equally

incidence of breast cancer in Japanese women increased 46%\\\\n\\\\nfrom 1995 to 2015 1 and it is now the most common cancer and the\\\\n\\\\nfifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Japanese\\\\n\\\\nwomen 2 Globally  between 5% and 10% of breast cancers are meta-\\\\n\\\\nstatic at the time of diagnosis 3 and ABC  including recurrent disease\\\\n\\\\nand mBC  is incurable 4 posing a significant public health burden and\\\\n\\\\nconsiderable treatment challenges 5\\\\n\\\\nFor postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC  endocrine therapy\\\\n\\\\nwith agents such as aromatase inhibitors  eg  anastrozole  letrozole \\\\n\\\\nor exemestane  is the standard first-line treatment6 and is recom-\\\\n\\\\nmended by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guide-\\\\n\\\\nlines 7 However  current first-line endocrine therapy alone may\\\\n\\\\nprovide only modest benefit in patients with HR+ ABC  and some\\\\n\\\\npatients may not respond at all 6 indicating the need for new treat-\\\\n\\\\nment options  In a randomized phase III trial of exemestane vs anas-\\\\n\\\\ntrozole as first-line therapy in Japanese women with HR+ ABC \\\\n\\\\nmedian time to progression was approximately 12 months in each\\\\n\\\\ngroup 8 Thus  there is interest in improving outcomes by combining\\\\n\\\\nfirst-line endocrine therapy with other agents \\\\n\\\\nPalbociclib is a potent  orally active  highly selective inhibitor of\\\\n\\\\nCDK4/6  it actively arrests cell cycle progression from the G1 phase\\\\n\\\\nto the S phase to inhibit DNA synthesis and the pathologic cellular\\\\n\\\\nproliferation characteristic of breast malignancies 9-11 Palbociclib\\\\n\\\\nshowed antiproliferative activity alone and synergistic activity with\\\\n\\\\ntamoxifen in ER+ luminal breast cancer cell lines 10 In clinical trials in\\\\n\\\\nnon-Japanese patients with retinoblastoma protein-positive solid\\\\n\\\\ntumors  single-agent palbociclib showed antitumor efficacy with an\\\\n\\\\nacceptable safety profile and was well tolerated 12 13 In an open-\\\\n\\\\nlabel  phase II PALOMA-1 trial  efficacy and safety of first-line letro-\\\\n\\\\nzole  2 5 mg QD  alone or in combination with palbociclib  125 mg\\\\n\\\\nQD  3 weeks on  1 week off [3/1 schedule]  was investigated in\\\\n\\\\nnon-Japanese postmenopausal women with ER+ and HER2  ABC 14\\\\nMedian PFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than\\\\n\\\\nwith letrozole alone  20 2 vs 10 2 months  respectively  HR  0 49 \\\\n\\\\n95% CI  0 32-0 75  one-sided P =  0004  AEs with combination ther-\\\\n\\\\napy were predictable and manageable  neutropenia was the most\\\\n\\\\ncommonly reported AE 14 These findings were confirmed in the\\\\n\\\\nphase III PALOMA-2 trial in postmenopausal women with ER+/\\\\n\\\\nHER2  ABC who received letrozole with or without palbociclib  3/1\\\\nschedule  as first-line therapy 15 Consistent

PALOMA-\\\\n\\\\n2  Ki-67 index values at a 15% or 20% cutoff did not show a patient\\\\n\\\\ngroup with a better or worse PFS with palbociclib plus letrozole 24\\\\n\\\\nAt the initial data cutoff  40 5% of patients had an objective\\\\n\\\\nresponse to treatment and the median DOR had not been reached \\\\n\\\\nThese findings are comparable to the objective responses of 43%\\\\n\\\\nand 42% in the PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-2 trials  respectively \\\\n\\\\nMoreover  the proportion of patients with disease control in the cur-\\\\n\\\\nrent study  85 7%  was similar to those in PALOMA-1  81%  and\\\\n\\\\nPALOMA-2  84 9% 14 15\\\\n\\\\nIn the current study  median OS also had not been reached by\\\\n\\\\nMarch 4  2016  The 1-year survival probability was 92 9%  with only\\\\n\\\\n3 deaths reported  and with most patients remaining in the follow-\\\\n\\\\nup phase at the time of data cutoff  Overall  the efficacy data from\\\\n\\\\nthe current phase II study in postmenopausal Japanese women with\\\\n\\\\nER+/HER  ABC who received first-line palbociclib plus letrozole are\\\\nconsistent with data from the 2 large PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-2\\\\n\\\\ntrials in non-Japanese patients  or predominantly non-Japanese\\\\n\\\\npatients  respectively 14 15\\\\n\\\\nWhen coadministered with letrozole  the full PK analysis con-\\\\n\\\\nducted in 6 Japanese patients in the current study showed a PK\\\\n\\\\nprofile that was remarkably similar to that reported in the\\\\n\\\\nPALOMA-1 study in non-Japanese patients 25 The Ctrough of plasma\\\\n\\\\npalbociclib in all patients was 89 4 and 86 8 ng/mL on day 15 of\\\\n\\\\ncycles 1 and 2  respectively  These data are highly consistent with\\\\n\\\\nthe exploratory findings from the phase I portion of this study\\\\n\\\\nwhen the plasma palbociclib Ctrough was 72 8 ng/mL after multiple\\\\n\\\\noral doses on day 8 of cycles 1 and 2 when coadministered with\\\\n\\\\nletrozole 18 In the phase II portion of PALOMA-1  the Ctrough of\\\\n\\\\nplasma palbociclib was 63 5 and 62 4 ng/mL on day 14 of cycles 1\\\\n\\\\nand 2  respectively  collectively indicating that the plasma palboci-\\\\n\\\\nclib mean Ctrough appeared to be slightly higher in Japanese\\\\n\\\\npatients  however  the distribution of plasma Ctrough in this study\\\\n\\\\nand PALOMA-1 overlap \\\\n\\\\nIn the current study  palbociclib in combination with letrozole\\\\n\\\\nwas well tolerated  The most commonly reported AE was uncompli-\\\\n\\\\ncated neutropenia  and AEs were manageable by implementing pal-\\\\n\\\\nbociclib dose interruptions or

heterogeneous disease associated with metabolic repro-\\\\ngramming  The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from Latin populations\\\\nof Hispanic origin  In this pilot study  metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed\\\\nto establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC  Data\\\\nfrom 1H-NMR  GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared  Statistics showed dis-\\\\ncrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms  The dif-\\\\nferentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid  amino acid and\\\\nfatty acid metabolism  This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches\\\\nin metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabo-\\\\nlism  Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better\\\\nunderstanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic\\\\norigin  Particularly  the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines\\\\nand the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid  cPA  In addition  the mapped meta-\\\\nbolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-His-\\\\npanic women  despite racial differences \\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\\nBreast cancer  BC  remains the most frequent type of cancer and the main cause of cancer\\\\n\\\\ndeaths among women worldwide [1]  According to GLOBOCAN  breast cancer mortality\\\\n\\\\nrates in developed

proposed as BC markers  along with genes and proteins \\\\n\\\\nMetabolomics is a consolidated field that has enabled to observe differences in metabolic\\\\n\\\\nsignatures generated by a pathological state such as cancer  These differences allow to postulate\\\\n\\\\nmolecular mechanisms involved in cancer  proposing and evaluating promissory treatment\\\\n\\\\ntargets and diagnosis tools [8–10]  Although the identification of breast cancer biomarkers by\\\\n\\\\nmetabolomics is still at an early stage  exploratory studies have allowed highlighting alterations\\\\n\\\\nin aerobic glycolysis  de novo lipogenesis  glutaminolysis  glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid\\\\nand amino acid metabolism [11–15]  These alterations have been used to identify metabolic\\\\n\\\\nchanges associated with advanced metastatic breast cancer in cell lines [16  17] and serum\\\\n\\\\n[18]  as well as breast cancer subtypes in plasma [13  19] and tissue [13  19–21]  Moreover  the\\\\n\\\\nidentification of suitable targets for drug development in cell lines [22–24] and therapy selec-\\\\n\\\\ntion in cell lines [25] and serum [26] have also been achieved \\\\n\\\\nHigh-throughput analytical chemical techniques such as chromatography coupled to mass\\\\n\\\\nspectrometry  MS  and nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  spectroscopy [27  28] have been\\\\n\\\\nused in metabolomics  along with univariate and multivariate statistics [29  30]  in order to\\\\n\\\\nprovide information on a large number of metabolites  in particular those with altered levels\\\\n\\\\nbetween healthy subjects and cancer patients [9  31–34]  Metabolomics in BC has been mainly\\\\n\\\\nperformed by NMR and MS  according to the purpose of the study and the characteristics of\\\\n\\\\nmeasured metabolites [35]  NMR has proven useful to determine significant differences in\\\\n\\\\nserum samples  allowing a discrimination between early and metastatic BC  regarding to\\\\n\\\\namino acid  small organic molecules and general lipid content [26  36  37]  and also to predict\\\\n\\\\nBC recurrence using amino acid  fatty acid and choline levels [38]  Both GC-MS and LC-MS\\\\n\\\\nhave detected alterations that have been proposed for several biomarkers  including amino\\\\n\\\\nacids [38–41]  small organic acids [13  38] and fatty acids [26  38]  whereas lysophospholipid\\\\n\\\\n[42  43] and carnitine [13] alterations have been found only by LC-MS  In addition  alterations\\\\n\\\\nin less polar lipids  such as glycerophospholipids [42  44  45] and glycerolipids [43  46] have\\\\n\\\\nbeen reported by LC-MS using a lipidomics approach \\\\n\\\\nIn last decades  extensive research in breast cancer has been conducted in order to under-\\\\n\\\\nstand its heterogeneity  however a comprehensive metabolic profile is still required to identify\\\\n\\\\npromising underlying metabolic signatures that can be used to improve breast cancer diagno-\\\\n\\\\nsis and treatment  Besides  most studies of metabolic alterations in BC have been performed\\\\n\\\\non Asian  European and North American women  little is known about the

of time-series prediction and control  Recently  Evolutionary\\\\nWavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop cancer prediction models  The\\\\npresent study proposes to use ensembles of Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks  The\\\\nsearch for a high quality ensemble is directed by a fitness function that incorporates the\\\\naccuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself  The\\\\nensemble approach is tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets \\\\none on Breast Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease  using a 10-fold cross-validation\\\\nstrategy  Our experimental results show that  for the first dataset  the performance was simi-\\\\nlar to previous studies reported in literature  On the second dataset  the

\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Australian women [1] \\\\n\\\\nwhile Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurological condition in Australia [2] \\\\n\\\\nThe identification and assessment process for both diseases is multi-staged  that is tedious \\\\n\\\\ntime-consuming  and challenging where data needs to be manually labeled  Such assessments\\\\n\\\\nmight also lead to misdiagnosis  In medical practice  in order to reduce the risk of misdiagno-\\\\n\\\\nsis  opinions from multiple doctors  or specialist doctors  are taken into account  A similar\\\\n\\\\napproach is used in the computational intelligence domain  where performance of prediction\\\\n\\\\nmodels  or specialist models  is improved by combining multiple models  thus creating an\\\\n\\\\nensemble of classifiers [3] \\\\n\\\\nEnsemble classifiers and their use have been an active area of research for the past two\\\\n\\\\ndecades  with Bagging [3] and Boosting [4] being two popular techniques  particularly in the\\\\n\\\\nfield of applied statistics  pattern recognition and machine learning [5–7]  Many of the predic-\\\\n\\\\ntion models have been improved by using ensembles of support vector machines [8  9]  latent\\\\n\\\\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0192192 February 8  2018 1 /

evaluate the performance of EWNN and ensembles of\\\\n\\\\nEWNNs  EWNN-e  and compare them with other ensemble techniques used on the same\\\\n\\\\ndata reported in literature  The findings of this paper aim to provide future researchers an\\\\n\\\\nalternative and effective model to compare with  Moreover  this study also investigates a newly\\\\n\\\\npublished Parkinson’s disease dataset with multiple speech recordings \\\\n\\\\nThe paper is organized as follows  Background provides an overview to Wavelet Neural\\\\n\\\\nNetworks and its structure  EWNN and its response to a two-spiral task  related work on prun-\\\\n\\\\ning ensembles  and description of some of the performance measures used in our study  The\\\\n\\\\nbiomedical datasets  proposed mechanism and the experimental setup are described in the\\\\n\\\\nExperimental Methodology section  Results & Discussion presents the outcome of experiments\\\\n\\\\nand compares the method’s effectiveness with other techniques reported in literature  That sec-\\\\n\\\\ntion is then followed by the conclusions and future work \\\\n\\\\nBackground\\\\nWavelet Neural Networks\\\\n\\\\nWavelet Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that combine the theory of wavelets\\\\n\\\\nand neural networks [16]  In standard neural networks  weights and biases are the only param-\\\\n\\\\neters that are trained and the most common activation functions used are sigmoid  hyperbolic\\\\n\\\\ntangent and linear functions  The activation functions found in WNNs are those that belong to\\\\n\\\\nthe family of wavelet basis functions  with the most common being the Morelet and Mexican\\\\nhat  In addition to weights and biases  three other parameters are used in WNNs  translate \\\\ndilate and rotate  The use of standard gradient methods to adjust WNN parameters  in particu-\\\\n\\\\nlar the weights  biases  the translate and dilate parameters  often resulted in premature conver-\\\\n\\\\ngence [16  17]  For that reason  global optimization approaches  such as genetic algorithms\\\\n\\\\nand evolutionary programming techniques  have been used in applications such as air and\\\\n\\\\nground traffic flow [18  19]  energy consumption [20]  large scale function estimation [21] \\\\n\\\\nfunction approximation [22] and power transformer monitoring [23]  A diagram of a WNN is\\\\n\\\\nshown in Fig 1  WNNs generally have a feed-forward structure  with one hidden layer having\\\\n\\\\nm wavelons  ψm  and a neuron in the output layer  There are also n shortcut connections from\\\\nthe inputs to the output neuron \\\\n\\\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks\\\\n\\\\nEWNNs were first proposed by Khan et al  [15] as a method for optimizing all WNN parame-\\\\n\\\\nters concurrently  The method was tested successfully on both simulated and real datasets [15] \\\\n\\\\nFor a detailed description of EWNN characteristics and performance  we refer the reader to\\\\n\\\\nreference [15] \\\\n\\\\nFig

trained by employing a\\\\n\\\\nsecond-order Newton optimization method where training took only 650 epochs  In contrast \\\\n\\\\nfor EWNNs with a wavelet activation function of Morelet shown in Fig 2 b  the optimum\\\\n\\\\nresponse of the EWNNs was achieved within 9 generations and with two wavelons only  This\\\\n\\\\nindicates its potential to separate non-linear classes effectively and efficiently \\\\n\\\\nClassifier ensembles and pruning\\\\n\\\\nThe role of a classifier C is to learn how to map the feature set to a set of class label s  The data\\\\nsamples are divided into training U and test V sets  The C is first trained on U where it learns\\\\nthe mapping process and then the performance of the C is measured on V  A multiple classifier\\\\nsystem  or ensemble  Ens  is composed of a set of base classifiers that are trained on the same\\\\ntraining dataset  and combined in a manner that improves the classification performance of\\\\n\\\\nthe system  There are two main methods for creating an ensemble  averaging and voting [27] \\\\n\\\\nAveraging is normally used for classifiers with numeric outputs  While voting is used for\\\\n\\\\nFig 1  Structure of a

and ensemble thinning are all\\\\n\\\\ndifferent names given to the same task—reducing ensemble sizes  Pruned ensembles exhibit\\\\n\\\\nbetter performance and robustness with lower computational and memory costs [28]  com-\\\\n\\\\npared to traditional ensemble techniques [29  30]  The three most popular ensemble pruning\\\\n\\\\ntechniques are ranking  clustering and optimization [31]  and this study focuses on the latter \\\\n\\\\nAmong the optimization techniques for ensemble pruning the most commonly used are evolu-\\\\n\\\\ntionary algorithms  semi-definite programming and hill climbing [32–34] \\\\n\\\\nGASEN-b was one of the earliest algorithms for ensemble pruning  and was introduced by\\\\n\\\\n[32]  The ensemble is represented as a bit string  with each decision tree model using a bit  The\\\\n\\\\nbit string representation provides a direct mechanism of adding or removing classifiers  as\\\\n\\\\nopposed to a weighting mechanism with a predefined threshold  A similar approach was also\\\\n\\\\nused in [6] to select/remove classifiers from a heterogeneous pool of networks \\\\n\\\\nZhang et al  [33] chose a quadratic integer programming approach for pruning  The weights\\\\n\\\\nwere kept binary and the size of the final ensemble was prefixed  In terms of computational\\\\n\\\\ncomplexity  the algorithm could run in polynomial time \\\\n\\\\nHill climbing methods generally use either forward selection or backward elimination of\\\\n\\\\nclassifiers  and include various performance measures  e g  diversity  weighted accuracy [35–\\\\n\\\\n39]  More recently  human-like foresight has been used as a measure to prune ensembles via\\\\n\\\\nhill climbing [34] \\\\n\\\\nIn this study  a pool of optimized EWNNs is pruned using genetic algorithms so that a\\\\n\\\\nbetter prediction model is obtained  The approach follows the GASEN-b mechanism [32]\\\\n\\\\nof pruning classifiers directly through bits so that to reduce the amount of parameter\\\\n\\\\ntuning  Our method introduces a fitness function that involves the sum of two accuracy\\\\n\\\\nmeasures  the accuracy of each individual classifier  and the ensemble accuracy using the\\\\n\\\\nvoting method \\\\n\\\\nNetwork performance measures\\\\n\\\\nThere are many performance measures for binary classification problems available in the liter-\\\\n\\\\nature  Power [40] investigated those measures and generalized them for multiclass problems \\\\n\\\\nNext  we present the measures used in this work \\\\n\\\\n• Training Accuracy  Tracc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the training set U \\\\n\\\\n• Test Accuracy  Teacc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the test set V  This is also\\\\nknown as the classification accuracy  and expressed as Teacc =  TP + TN / P + N  TP repre-\\\\nsents true positive cases  i e  accurate classification of control  non-diseased  samples  TN\\\\n\\\\nrepresents true negative cases  i e  accurate classification of diseased samples  and  P + N  is\\\\nthe total number of positive and negative test samples \\\\n\\\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and

positive cases  mathematically\\\\nexpressed as Sens = TP/ TP + FN  FN is the number of false negatives and reflects the more\\\\nserious mistake of classifying a disease sample as control \\\\n\\\\n• Specificity  Spec  measurement of the fraction of true negative cases  mathematically repre-\\\\nsented as Spec = TN/ TN + FP  FP reflects the misclassification of control samples as dis-\\\\neased

repos-\\\\n\\\\nitory of mammographic images  available at  http //marathon csee usf edu/Mammography/\\\\n\\\\nDatabase html  with different resolutions and obtained from various hospitals [46  47]  The\\\\n\\\\nsuspicious areas on the mammograms were manually marked by two experienced radiologists \\\\n\\\\nFor analysis  these markings are represented as chain codes and hence can be extracted easily \\\\n\\\\nIn the dataset used by [48]  200 mammographic images scanned by a HOWTEK scanner at\\\\n\\\\n43 5 micron per pixel spatial resolution were downloaded and extracted via the chain code \\\\n\\\\nThat dataset had an equal number of benign and malignant samples  Even though [48] derived\\\\n\\\\n25 features from the extracted region  only 6 of the features were actually investigated in the\\\\n\\\\npresent study  in order to provide a fair comparison with previous works that used the same\\\\n\\\\ndataset [11  49]  Among those 6 features  there are 4 BIRADS  Breast Imaging Reporting and\\\\n\\\\nData System established by [50]  lexicon features  mass shape  mass margin  assessment  breast\\\\ndensity  specified by an expert radiologist  and 2 features  Patient age and subtlety  that were\\\\nextracted from the individual mammographic records \\\\n\\\\nLittle’s Parkinson’s Dataset  LPD  This dataset  available at  http //archive ics uci edu/\\\\n\\\\nml  was acquired from the online machine learning database repository from the University of\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia at Irvine  UCI  [51  52]  It is a challenging  imbalanced dataset that has been investi-\\\\n\\\\ngated previously by several researchers [9  53–55]  It contains 195 samples  each with 22 differ-\\\\n\\\\nent biomedical voice measurements  These voice measurements were taken from 31\\\\n\\\\nindividuals  where 23 had Parkinson’s disease  Each patient has between 6 and 7 records in the\\\\n\\\\ndata set  totalling 195 samples \\\\n\\\\nSakar’s Parkinson’s Dataset  SPD  The

represents control subjects \\\\n\\\\nTraining and test sets\\\\n\\\\nFor all the datasets  the data was divided into 90% training and 10% test data  The proposed\\\\n\\\\napproach is divided into two main phases as shown in Fig 3  Phase I creates optimal EWNNs\\\\n\\\\nfrom cross validation folds conducted on the 90% training and validation data and the average\\\\n\\\\nclassification accuracy Teacc for the EWNNs was reported  The optimal EWNNs were then\\\\nused by next phase  Phase II uses genetic algorithm to prune the optimal EWNN classifiers\\\\n\\\\nwhere the separate test set was used and a final ensemble classification accuracy ETeacc was\\\\nthen reported \\\\n\\\\nIn both LPD and SPD datasets  individuals had different numbers of records  Thus  if more\\\\n\\\\nthan half of the individual’s records are classified as Parkinson’s disease  then the individual\\\\n\\\\nitself is classified as Parkinson’s disease  diseased  This approach was adopted from [45  54] in\\\\n\\\\norder to avoid over-fitting  as the frequency response of the records of the same patient are\\\\n\\\\npotentially very similar \\\\n\\\\nApproach\\\\n\\\\nPhase I  Generating optimized EWNNs \\\\n\\\\n1  EWNN initialization  An EWNN genome requires the initialization of the number of wave-\\\\n\\\\nlons  the different parameters of each wavelon  and the wavelet function s \\\\n\\\\n• The number of wavelons is critical as too many wavelons would likely result in over-fitting\\\\n\\\\nand too few would not capture the variability of the data [56]  The three datasets have been\\\\n\\\\ninvestigated in detail under different parameter settings and those are reported in [15] \\\\n\\\\nThe best configurations from that study were adopted here  The number of wavelons used\\\\n\\\\nfor each dataset is shown in Table 2 \\\\n\\\\n• Selection of an appropriate activation function depends on the data itself  but the Mexican\\\\n\\\\nhat wavelet has performed satisfactorily in many applications [56]  For the DDSM  the\\\\n\\\\npresent study uses a heterogeneous WNN with four possible activation functions  For the\\\\n\\\\nremaining case studies  we used a homogeneous WNN that uses the Mexican hat wavelet\\\\n\\\\nas activation function \\\\n\\\\n• Each wavelon is represented by matrices of inputs xn 2 [1  Feat]  switches cn 2 {0  1} where\\\\n0/1

the μ fittest are selected from both parents and offspring for the\\\\nnext generation  The value of μ and λ used for the different case studies are shown in\\\\nTable 2 \\\\n\\\\n3  Fitness evaluation  All individuals in the population are evaluated and sorted based on their\\\\n\\\\naccuracies and mean square error where the best individual is promoted as parent to the\\\\n\\\\nnext generation  The purpose of using two dimensional sorting is to promote networks\\\\n\\\\nwith uncorrelated evaluation metrics in generations ahead \\\\n\\\\n4  Mutation  A 1% mutation rate is used to generate new EWNNs  similar to [15]  Mutation\\\\n\\\\noccurs in three different ways  For continuous parameters  such as input weights  wavelon\\\\n\\\\nweights  translation  rotation  dilation parameters and the bias  values are perturbed by add-\\\\n\\\\ning a small percentage of the current value  For binary parameters  e g  switch  the value is\\\\n\\\\ninverted from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0  For the third type of mutation  a network input is randomly\\\\n\\\\nchanged to another input feature in the feature list  or similarly  a wavelet function is ran-\\\\n\\\\ndomly changed to another wavelet function in the list \\\\n\\\\n5  Termination condition  The simulations stop at 2 000 generations  We observed that this\\\\n\\\\nvalue is sufficient for the evolutionary process to converge to a high-quality solution  The\\\\n\\\\noptimal EWNNs are later used in Phase II to create the ensembles  A total of 50 indepen-\\\\n\\\\ndent evolutionary runs were executed for each of the cross-validation folds \\\\n\\\\nPhase II  Genetic algorithm-based ensemble \\\\n\\\\nGiven the set of optimized EWNN ensembles  the next step is to prune them  This stage uses\\\\n\\\\nanother

offspring in each generation  For ensemble pruning \\\\nhaving 3 parents considerably reduced the risk of premature convergence and at the same\\\\n\\\\ntime kept the evolutionary process under a reasonable selective pressure \\\\n\\\\n3  Fitness evaluation  The fitness value of each chromosome is evaluated as in Eq 2  It is an\\\\n\\\\naverage of the individual accuracies Tracc of the active

ensemble approach improved the performance of the network from 89 0%\\\\n\\\\nto 95 5%  An MCC score of 91 0% also indicates a very high classification accuracy  For the\\\\n\\\\nLPD dataset the accuracy increased from 92 9% to 100%  and for the SPD dataset it increased\\\\n\\\\nfrom 66 3% to 90 0% \\\\n\\\\nWhat were the significant features identified by the process  Fig 4 is the averaged connected\\\\n\\\\nfeatures for all datasets  across 50 independent runs in EWNN  and the number of active classi-\\\\n\\\\nfiers in the EWNN-e  In a standard WNN all features are connected to every wavelons in the\\\\n\\\\nhidden layer  While in EWNNs  from Fig 4  there is some variability in how often these fea-\\\\n\\\\ntures are connected  This indicates the flexibility of pruning features  during training  at the\\\\n\\\\nhidden layer  as opposed to the input layer  for which many feature reduction methods already\\\\n\\\\nexist  For the DDSM dataset  mass margin  patient age  mass shape and assessment were the top\\\\nfour features that had an impact on performance—similarly to [48]  For the LPD dataset \\\\n\\\\nspread1 and D2 were the top two features—similarly to [53]  The trend of feature selection was\\\\nfound to be same for both the EWNN and EWNN-e networks for all datasets except SPD  For\\\\n\\\\nthe SPD dataset  Shimmerapq3 is the top feature in the ensemble network  whereas Shimmerdda\\\\nis the top one for the individual EWNNs  This drift in frequency of feature selection indicates\\\\n\\\\npossible significance of the feature in the ensemble domain \\\\n\\\\nShould every wavelon be fully connected  The connectivity or dimensionality of a wavelon\\\\n\\\\nis determined by the number of active or connected inputs  Fig 5 displays the sum of the wave-\\\\n\\\\nlons’ dimensions for each dataset  over 50 independent runs and  over the number of active\\\\n\\\\nclassifiers in the final EWNN-e  across the 10 folds  The frequency of each wavelon dimension\\\\n\\\\nis lower in the ensemble network  as classifiers are pruned  The ensemble networks exhibited\\\\n\\\\ndifferent trends  depending on the dataset  Interestingly  for the DDSM dataset we observed a\\\\n\\\\nreduction in the number of 6-dimensional wavelons  thus indicating that fully connected\\\\n\\\\nEWNNs were not part of the ensemble network  The frequent occurrence of wavelons with\\\\n\\\\nlower dimensions indicates that WNNs should be given the flexibility to adjust their input  in\\\\n\\\\ncontrast to a standard WNNs  where all inputs are connected [16] \\\\n\\\\nHow many classifiers are necessary to create an effective ensemble  The average number of\\\\n\\\\nEWNNs in the ensemble networks for the datasets is shown in Table 4  The ensemble networks\\\\n\\\\ncombine around 1/3  14-17  of the 50 available EWNNs  and they improved both speed and\\\\n\\\\nperformance  compared to the non-ensemble approach \\\\n\\\\nFrom Table 5  it can be concluded that the proposed method generated either competitive\\\\n\\\\nor better results in comparison to existing techniques  An advantage of EWNN-e is that it does\\\\n\\\\nnot require pre-processing for feature pruning  which is present in some of the comparison\\\\n\\\\nmethods  Given the results  it can be stated that the ensemble version of EWNN classifiers is a\\\\n\\\\nsuitable approach for predictive analysis  Just for clarification purposes  and to put the results\\\\n\\\\ninto context  for the DDSM dataset  the accuracy reported for NN-e was achieved with an\\\\n\\\\nensemble of 127 classifiers [11]  as opposed to the average of only 14 50 in the proposed\\\\n\\\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s

the classifier is much\\\\n\\\\nmore complex than the classifiers obtained by our approach \\\\n\\\\nConclusion\\\\nEnsemble approaches aim at combining the classification power of individual
