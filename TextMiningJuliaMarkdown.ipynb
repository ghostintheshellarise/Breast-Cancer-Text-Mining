endocrine\\ntherapy  and targeted therapy  overall survival rates of breast\\ncancer have increased  however  these therapies have not\\nproduced signiﬁcant changes in the prognosis of patients with\\nbreast cancer accompanied by distant metastasis \\nThe main sites of metastasis for breast cancer are the bone \\n\\nlung  and liver  whereas metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is\\nrelatively rare  reported incidence rates are 2% to 18% of breast\\ncancer cases  Importantly  gastric metastasis from invasive\\nlobular breast carcinoma is reported to occur at a higher rate\\nthan the metastasis from invasive ductal carcinoma [2] Gastric\\ncancer has high incidence rates in Korea [1] and differentiation\\nbetween primary gastric cancer and metastatic gastric

 BC  is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy\\nleading cause of cancer death among women\\n\\nworldwide [1] Although early detection and comprehensive\\ntreatment have been implemented  the 5-year survival rate\\namong patients with BC who develop metastatic disease is only\\n24% [2] To improve the clinical outcome of patients  there is an\\nurgent need for the development of early biomarkers that could\\nprovide prognostic information regarding treatment response\\nand disease progression \\nAt present  evaluation of the metabolic tumor burden in BC is\\n\\ndependent on serum markers  including Cancer Antigen 15-3\\n CA15-3  and Carcinoembryonic Antigen  CEA  The major\\nissues with using these markers  however  are a lack of sensitivity\\nand speciﬁcity  especially in early or localized disease [3 4]\\n\\nTherefore  in recent years  much effort has been devoted to the\\ndetection and characterization of circulating cell-free DNA\\n cfDNA  in BC  cfDNA is nucleic acid fragments that circulate in\\nthe plasma  serum  and other bodily ﬂuids outside of cells  The\\nﬁrst report was by Mandel and Metais in 1948 [5] but the topic\\nattracted little attention in the scientiﬁc community  It was not\\nuntil 1977 that cfDNA was recognized as a useful tool for\\nmonitoring the effects of therapy in cancer patients [6] In healthy\\nindividuals  cfDNA is derived from apoptotic cells and is\\n\\nted  measuring 185 to 200 base pairs  bp  in length \\nas in cancer patients it results from apoptotic and necrotic\\n\\ncells [7 8] Therefore  elevated levels of long DNA

cancer  cyclin-dependent kinase  Japanese  letrozole  palbociclib\\n\\n1 | INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe incidence of breast cancer in Japanese women increased 46%\\n\\nfrom 1995 to 2015 1 and it is now the most common cancer and the\\n\\nfifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Japanese\\n\\nwomen 2 Globally  between 5% and 10% of breast cancers are meta-\\n\\nstatic at the time of diagnosis 3 and ABC  including recurrent disease\\n\\nand mBC  is incurable 4 posing a significant public health burden and\\n\\nconsiderable treatment challenges 5\\n\\nFor postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC  endocrine therapy\\n\\nwith agents such as aromatase inhibitors  eg  anastrozole  letrozole \\n\\nor exemestane  is the standard first-line treatment6 and is recom-\\n\\nmended by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guide-\\n\\nlines 7 However  current first-line endocrine therapy alone may\\n\\nprovide only modest benefit in patients with HR+ ABC  and some\\n\\npatients may not respond at all 6 indicating the need for new treat-\\n\\nment options  In a randomized phase III trial of exemestane vs anas-\\n\\ntrozole as first-line therapy in Japanese women with HR+ ABC \\n\\nmedian time to progression was approximately 12 months in each\\n\\ngroup 8 Thus  there is interest in improving outcomes by combining\\n\\nfirst-line endocrine therapy with other agents \\n\\nPalbociclib is a potent  orally active  highly selective inhibitor of\\n\\nCDK4/6  it actively arrests cell cycle progression from the G1 phase\\n\\nto the S phase to inhibit DNA synthesis and the pathologic cellular\\n\\nproliferation characteristic of breast malignancies 9-11 Palbociclib\\n\\nshowed antiproliferative activity alone and synergistic activity with\\n\\ntamoxifen in ER+ luminal breast cancer cell lines 10 In clinical trials in\\n\\nnon-Japanese patients with retinoblastoma protein-positive solid\\n\\ntumors  single-agent palbociclib showed antitumor efficacy with an\\n\\nacceptable safety profile and was well tolerated 12 13 In an open-\\n\\nlabel  phase II PALOMA-1 trial  efficacy and safety of first-line letro-\\n\\nzole  2 5 mg QD  alone or in combination with palbociclib  125 mg\\n\\nQD  3 weeks on  1 week off [3/1 schedule]  was investigated in\\n\\nnon-Japanese postmenopausal women with ER+ and HER2  ABC 14\\nMedian PFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than\\n\\nwith letrozole alone  20 2 vs 10 2 months  respectively  HR  0 49 \\n\\n95% CI  0 32-0 75  one-sided P =  0004  AEs with combination ther-\\n\\napy were predictable and manageable  neutropenia was the most\\n\\ncommonly reported AE 14 These findings were confirmed in the\\n\\nphase III PALOMA-2 trial in postmenopausal women with ER+/\\n\\nHER2  ABC who received letrozole with or without palbociclib  3/1\\nschedule  as first-line therapy 15 Consistent with PALOMA-1  median\\n\\nPFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than with\\n\\nletrozole monotherapy  24 8 vs 14 5 months  HR  0 58  95% CI \\n\\n0 46-0 72  two-sided P  480 ms  based\\n\\non the mean value of triplicate ECGs  family or personal history of\\n\\nQT syndrome were also ineligible \\n\\n2 3 | Study treatment\\n\\nPatients received 125 mg palbociclib orally QD with food on days 1\\n\\nto 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off palbociclib treat-\\n\\nment  coadministered with letrozole 2 5 mg orally QD  Study treat-\\n\\nments were continued until radiologically documented PD according\\n\\nto RECIST  v1 1  symptomatic deterioration  unacceptable toxicity \\n\\nor withdrawal of consent \\n\\nPalbociclib dose interruptions or delays were permitted if patients\\n\\nexperienced the following protocol-specified treatment-related AEs \\n\\nuncomplicated grade 3 neutropenia  ANC  480 ms  more frequent ECG monitoring occurred per the investiga-\\n\\ntor’s best medical judgment until QTc was ≤480 ms  If these criteria\\n\\nwere met within 2 weeks of the dose interruption or cycle delay  pal-\\n\\nbociclib treatment was resumed  If not  resumption or permanent dis-\\n\\ncontinuation of palbociclib treatment was based on the investigator’s\\n\\nbest medical judgment of whether the patient was deriving clinical\\n\\nbenefit from treatment \\n\\nProtocol-specified palbociclib dose reductions were permitted \\n\\ndepending on the type and severity of toxicity reported  The recom-\\n\\nmended first dose reduction was from 125 to 100 mg/d  and the\\n\\nrecommended second dose reduction was from 100 to 75 mg/d \\n\\nPatients requiring >2 palbociclib dose reductions were discontinued\\n\\nfrom the study but remained in the follow-up phase  Subsequent\\n\\ntreatment cycles were given at the reduced dose level  dose re-esca-\\n\\nlation was not permitted  Patients who continued receiving letrozole\\n\\nremained in the active treatment phase of the study \\n\\nLetrozole dose interruptions for treatment-related toxicities were\\n\\npermitted based on the investigator’s judgment  Letrozole dose\\n\\nreductions were not permitted  Patients who discontinued letrozole\\n\\nbecause of treatment-related toxicity also discontinued palbociclib\\n\\nand  consequently  were discontinued from the active treatment\\n\\nphase of the study and instead entered the follow-up phase \\n\\n2 4 | Assessments\\n\\n2 4 1 | Efficacy\\n\\nDisease assessments included computed tomography or magnetic res-\\n\\nonance imaging of the chest  abdomen  pelvis  and any other sites of\\n\\ndisease as clinically indicated  clinical assessment of superficial disease\\n\\n including lesion measurements  and radionucleotide bone scans  All\\n\\nbaseline assessments were carried out before giving study drugs  pal-\\n\\nbociclib and letrozole  Postbaseline tumor assessments were done\\n\\nevery 12 weeks and bone scans  if applicable  every 24 weeks until\\n\\nevidence of disease progression  Radiographic disease progression\\n\\nusing RECIST or clinical disease progression  if photographed or palpa-\\n\\nble lesions  was assessed  Objective tumor response  using RECIST \\n\\nwas reported as ORR  percentage of patients with CR + PR  and DCR\\n\\n percentage of patients with CR + PR + stable disease lasting\\n\\n≥24 weeks  All radiographic or clinical  where applicable  efficacy\\n\\nevaluations were based on investigator assessments  OS was deter-\\n\\nmined every 6 months from the last dose of study treatment \\n\\n2 4 2 | Pharmacokinetics\\n\\nA subset of 6 patients underwent intensive PK sampling  and blood\\n\\nsamples were taken on cycle 1/day 15 at predose and at 1  2  4  6 \\n\\n8  10  and 24 hours after dosing  then at predose on cycle 2/day 15 \\n\\nFor this subset  plasma concentration-time data obtained after study\\n\\ndrug administration on cycle 1/day 15 were analyzed using non-\\n\\ncompartmental analysis methods to determine the following PK\\n\\nparameters  Cmax  tmax  AUCs  and CL/F  For assessment of palboci-\\n\\nclib plasma Ctrough  blood samples from all patients were collected on\\n\\nday 15 of cycles 1 and 2 before giving study drug  Plasma samples\\n\\nwere analyzed for palbociclib concentrations using a validated HPLC\\n\\nmethod with tandem mass spectrometry at PPD Development  Rich-\\n\\nmond  VA  USA  Lower limit of quantification for palbociclib was\\n\\n1 00 ng/mL \\n\\nMASUDA ET AL  | 805\\n\\n\\n\\n2 4 3 | Safety\\n\\nSafety was assessed by treatment-related AEs and clinically signifi-\\n\\ncant changes in physical examination findings or abnormal laboratory\\n\\nassessments  AEs were reported throughout the study using Med-\\n\\nDRA version 18 1  International Council for Harmonisation  Geneva \\n\\nSwitzerland  and protocol-specified clusters of preferred terms \\n\\nbased on incidence  severity  using Common Terminology Criteria for\\n\\nAdverse Events  version 4 0  and investigator-assessed relationship\\n\\nto study treatment  Physical examinations and 12-lead ECGs were\\n\\ncarried out at baseline  day 1 of each cycle  and at the end of treat-\\n\\nment  Laboratory assessments  hematology and blood chemistry \\n\\nwere conducted at baseline  days 1 and 15 of cycle 1  and on day 1\\n\\nof each subsequent cycle \\n\\n2 5 | Statistical analyses\\n\\nPrimary endpoint of this study was the 1-year PFS probability of the\\n\\nlower limit of the 90% CI exceeding 40%  which would correspond\\n\\nto a median PFS of 9 months  assuming that PFS had an exponential\\n\\ndistribution  Sample size for this study was 32 patients to meet the\\n\\nabove criteria with a >80% probability based on the assumption that\\n\\nmedian PFS for patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole was\\n\\n18 months  Accounting for a 20% potential patient drop-out  total\\n\\nenrollment target was 40 patients \\n\\nThe FAS  defined as all patients who received ≥1 dose of palbociclib \\n\\nwas used for all efficacy analyses  Primary endpoint of 1-year PFS was\\n\\ndefined as the proportion of patients without PFS events  ie  PD or\\n\\ndeath from any cause  at 12 months after the first palbociclib dose  PFS\\n\\nand 90% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method \\n\\nSubgroup analyses of PFS were carried out to investigate the\\n\\neffects of baseline

subgroup analyses of\\n\\nPFS  median PFS  and 95% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-\\n\\nMeier method \\n\\nObjective response rate and DCR were estimated  DOR was\\n\\nbased on the subset of patients in the FAS who had an objective\\n\\nresponse  CR or PR  and was defined as the time from first objective\\n\\nresponse to first objective PD or death  OS was estimated using the\\n\\nKaplan-Meier method  and 1-year OS was calculated in the same\\n\\nway as for 1-year PFS \\n\\nThe PK analysis set was defined as all patients with ≥1 PK\\n\\nparameter of primary interest in ≥1 PK sampling period  PK parame-\\n\\nters are presented using descriptive statistics  For the full palbociclib\\n\\nPK profile subset  n = 6  plasma concentration-time data obtained\\n\\nafter

DISCUSSION\\n\\nIn this open-label  phase II study in postmenopausal Japanese\\n\\nwomen with ER+/HER2  ABC  first-line treatment with the combi-\\nnation of palbociclib 125 mg daily  3/1 schedule  plus letrozole\\n\\n2 5 mg daily resulted in a 1-year PFS probability of 75 0%  90% CI \\n\\n61 3%-84 4%  at the time of the initial March 4  2016 data cutoff \\n\\nThus  the expected efficacy of palbociclib plus letrozole was\\n\\nobserved because the lower limit of the 90% CI exceeded 40%  At\\n\\nthe later October 31  2016 data cutoff  1-year PFS probability was\\n\\n75 6%  90% CI  62 4%-84 7%  The 1-year PFS probability in this\\n\\nstudy was similar to the results in the PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-2\\n\\nstudies 21 Median PFS in patients in the PALOMA-1 study was\\n\\n20 2 months  95% CI  13 8-27 5  and in the PALOMA-2 trial it was\\n\\n24 8 months  22 1–NE  after a median follow up of 29 6 and\\n\\n23 months  respectively 14 15 The median PFS was not reached by\\n\\nthe primary cutoff

metabolic repro-\\ngramming  The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from Latin populations\\nof Hispanic origin  In this pilot study  metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed\\nto establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC  Data\\nfrom 1H-NMR  GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared  Statistics showed dis-\\ncrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms  The dif-\\nferentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid  amino acid and\\nfatty acid metabolism  This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches\\nin metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabo-\\nlism  Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better\\nunderstanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic\\norigin  Particularly  the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines\\nand the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid  cPA  In addition  the mapped meta-\\nbolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-His-\\npanic women  despite racial differences \\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer  BC  remains the most frequent type of cancer and the main cause of cancer\\n\\ndeaths among women worldwide [1]  According to GLOBOCAN  breast cancer mortality\\n\\nrates in developed countries have declined in the last years  but the incidence rates

with genes and proteins \\n\\nMetabolomics is a consolidated field that has enabled to observe differences in metabolic\\n\\nsignatures generated by a pathological state such as cancer  These differences allow to postulate\\n\\nmolecular mechanisms involved in cancer  proposing and evaluating promissory treatment\\n\\ntargets and diagnosis tools [8–10]  Although the identification of breast cancer biomarkers by\\n\\nmetabolomics is still at an early stage  exploratory studies have allowed highlighting alterations\\n\\nin aerobic glycolysis  de novo lipogenesis  glutaminolysis  glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid\\nand amino acid metabolism [11–15]  These alterations have been used to identify metabolic\\n\\nchanges associated with advanced metastatic breast cancer in cell lines [16  17] and serum\\n\\n[18]  as well as breast cancer subtypes in plasma [13  19] and tissue [13  19–21]  Moreover  the\\n\\nidentification of suitable targets for drug development in cell lines [22–24] and therapy selec-\\n\\ntion in cell lines [25] and serum [26] have also been achieved \\n\\nHigh-throughput analytical chemical techniques such as chromatography coupled to mass\\n\\nspectrometry  MS  and nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  spectroscopy [27  28] have been\\n\\nused in metabolomics  along with univariate and multivariate statistics [29  30]  in order to\\n\\nprovide information on a large number of metabolites  in particular those with altered levels\\n\\nbetween healthy subjects and cancer patients [9  31–34]  Metabolomics in BC has been mainly\\n\\nperformed by NMR and MS  according to the purpose of the study and the characteristics of\\n\\nmeasured metabolites [35]  NMR has proven useful to determine significant differences in\\n\\nserum samples  allowing a discrimination between early and metastatic BC  regarding to\\n\\namino acid  small organic molecules and general lipid content [26  36  37]  and also to predict\\n\\nBC recurrence using amino acid  fatty acid and choline levels [38]  Both GC-MS and LC-MS\\n\\nhave detected alterations that have been proposed for several biomarkers  including amino\\n\\nacids [38–41]  small organic acids [13  38] and fatty acids [26  38]  whereas lysophospholipid\\n\\n[42  43] and carnitine [13] alterations have been found only by LC-MS  In addition  alterations\\n\\nin less polar lipids  such as glycerophospholipids [42  44  45] and glycerolipids [43  46] have\\n\\nbeen reported by LC-MS using a lipidomics approach \\n\\nIn last decades  extensive research in breast cancer has been conducted in order to under-\\n\\nstand its heterogeneity  however a comprehensive metabolic profile is still required to identify\\n\\npromising underlying metabolic signatures that can be used to improve breast cancer diagno-\\n\\nsis and treatment  Besides  most studies of metabolic alterations in BC have been performed\\n\\non Asian  European and North American women  little is known about the metabolic signa-\\n\\nture of BC in women from developing regions  In the present pilot study  a multiplatform\\n\\nmetabolomic and

Recently  Evolutionary\\nWavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop cancer prediction models  The\\npresent study proposes to use ensembles of Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks  The\\nsearch for a high quality ensemble is directed by a fitness function that incorporates the\\naccuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself  The\\nensemble approach is tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets \\none on Breast Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease  using a 10-fold cross-validation\\nstrategy  Our experimental results show that  for the first dataset  the performance was simi-\\nlar to previous studies reported in literature  On the second dataset  the Evolutionary Wave-\\nlet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous methods  The third\\ndataset is relatively new and this study is the first to report benchmark results \\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause

 in order to reduce the risk of misdiagno-\\n\\nsis  opinions from multiple doctors  or specialist doctors  are taken into account  A similar\\n\\napproach is used in the computational intelligence domain  where performance of prediction\\n\\nmodels  or specialist models  is improved by combining multiple models  thus creating an\\n\\nensemble of classifiers [3] \\n\\nEnsemble classifiers and their use have been an active area of research for the past two\\n\\ndecades  with Bagging [3] and Boosting [4] being two popular techniques  particularly in the\\n\\nfield of applied statistics

Networks are a class of neural networks that combine the theory of wavelets\\n\\nand neural networks [16]  In standard neural networks  weights and biases are the only param-\\n\\neters that are trained and the most common activation functions used are sigmoid  hyperbolic\\n\\ntangent and linear functions  The activation functions found in WNNs are those that belong to\\n\\nthe family of wavelet basis functions  with the most common being the Morelet and Mexican\\nhat  In addition to weights and biases  three other parameters are used in WNNs  translate \\ndilate and rotate  The use of standard gradient methods to adjust WNN parameters  in particu-\\n\\nlar the weights  biases  the translate and dilate parameters  often resulted in premature conver-\\n\\ngence [16  17]  For that reason  global optimization approaches  such as genetic algorithms\\n\\nand evolutionary programming techniques  have been used in applications such as air and\\n\\nground traffic flow [18  19]  energy consumption [20]  large scale function estimation [21] \\n\\nfunction approximation [22] and power transformer monitoring [23]  A diagram of a WNN is\\n\\nshown in Fig 1  WNNs generally have a

mammographic images  available at  http //marathon csee usf edu/Mammography/\\n\\nDatabase html  with different resolutions and obtained from various hospitals [46  47]  The\\n\\nsuspicious areas on the mammograms were manually marked by two experienced radiologists \\n\\nFor analysis  these markings are represented as chain codes and hence can be extracted easily \\n\\nIn the dataset used by [48]  200 mammographic images scanned by a HOWTEK scanner at\\n\\n43 5 micron per pixel spatial resolution were downloaded and extracted via the chain code \\n\\nThat dataset had an equal number of benign and malignant samples  Even though [48] derived\\n\\n25 features from the extracted region  only 6 of the features were actually investigated in the\\n\\npresent study  in order to provide a fair comparison with previous works that used the same\\n\\ndataset [11  49]  Among those 6 features  there are 4 BIRADS  Breast Imaging Reporting and\\n\\nData System established by [50]  lexicon features  mass shape  mass margin  assessment  breast\\ndensity  specified by an expert radiologist  and 2 features  Patient age and subtlety  that were\\nextracted from the individual mammographic

22 differ-\\n\\nent biomedical voice measurements  These voice measurements were taken from 31\\n\\nindividuals  where 23 had Parkinson’s disease  Each patient has between 6 and 7 records in

subjects \\n\\nTraining and test sets\\n\\nFor all the datasets  the data was divided into 90% training and 10% test data  The proposed\\n\\napproach is divided into two main phases as shown in Fig 3  Phase I creates optimal EWNNs\\n\\nfrom cross validation folds conducted on the 90% training and validation data and the average\\n\\nclassification accuracy Teacc for the EWNNs was reported  The optimal EWNNs were then\\nused by next phase  Phase II uses genetic algorithm to prune the optimal EWNN classifiers\\n\\nwhere the separate test set was used and a final ensemble classification accuracy ETeacc was\\nthen reported \\n\\nIn both LPD and SPD datasets  individuals had different numbers of records  Thus  if more\\n\\nthan half of the individual’s records are classified as Parkinson’s disease  then the individual\\n\\nitself is classified as Parkinson’s disease  diseased  This approach was adopted from [45  54] in\\n\\norder to avoid over-fitting  as the frequency response of the records of the same patient are\\n\\npotentially very similar \\n\\nApproach\\n\\nPhase I  Generating optimized EWNNs \\n\\n1  EWNN initialization  An EWNN genome requires the initialization of the number of wave-\\n\\nlons  the different parameters of each wavelon  and the wavelet function s \\n\\n• The number of wavelons is critical as too many wavelons would likely result in over-fitting\\n\\nand too few would not capture the variability of the data [56]  The three datasets have been\\n\\ninvestigated in detail under different parameter settings and those are reported in [15] \\n\\nThe best configurations from that study were adopted here  The number of wavelons used\\n\\nfor each dataset is shown in Table 2 \\n\\n• Selection of an appropriate activation function depends on the data itself  but the Mexican\\n\\nhat wavelet has performed satisfactorily in many applications [56]  For the DDSM  the\\n\\npresent study uses a heterogeneous WNN with four possible activation functions  For the\\n\\nremaining case studies  we used a homogeneous WNN that uses the Mexican hat wavelet\\n\\nas activation function \\n\\n• Each wavelon is represented by matrices of inputs xn 2 [1  Feat]  switches cn 2 {0  1} where\\n0/1 indicates non-connected/connected features  respectively  input weights wxnm 2 [−1 \\n+1]  scale parameters αnm 2 [0  1]

population and λ refers to the number of offspring pro-\\nduced in a generation  In  μ  λ -ES  offspring replaces the parents as the μ fittest are selected\\n\\nFig 3  Flowchart of the two phases of

offspring for the\\nnext generation  The value of μ and λ used for the different case studies are shown in\\nTable 2 \\n\\n3  Fitness evaluation  All individuals in the population are evaluated and sorted based on their\\n\\naccuracies and mean square error where the best individual is promoted as parent to the\\n\\nnext generation  The purpose of using two dimensional sorting is to promote networks\\n\\nwith uncorrelated evaluation metrics in generations ahead \\n\\n4  Mutation  A 1% mutation rate is used to generate new EWNNs  similar to [15]  Mutation\\n\\noccurs in three different ways  For continuous parameters  such as input weights  wavelon\\n\\nweights  translation  rotation  dilation parameters and the bias  values are perturbed by add-\\n\\ning a small percentage of the current value  For binary parameters  e g  switch  the value is\\n\\ninverted from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0  For the third type of mutation  a network input is randomly\\n\\nchanged to another input feature in the feature list  or similarly  a wavelet function is ran-\\n\\ndomly changed to another wavelet function in the list \\n\\n5  Termination condition  The simulations stop at 2 000 generations  We observed that this\\n\\nvalue is sufficient for the evolutionary process to converge to a high-quality solution  The\\n\\noptimal EWNNs are later used in Phase II to create the ensembles  A total of 50 indepen-\\n\\ndent evolutionary runs were executed for each of the cross-validation folds \\n\\nPhase II  Genetic algorithm-based ensemble \\n\\nGiven the set of optimized EWNN ensembles  the next step is to prune them  This stage uses\\n\\nanother genetic algorithm as follows \\n\\n1  Chromosome Chr representation  A k-bit string is used to represent an ensemble with the\\noptimized EWNNs  A bit value of 1 indicates that the classifier is actively used in the ensem-\\n\\nble  0 otherwise \\n\\n2  Population size  After a number of preliminary tests  we decided for an  μ+λ -evolutionary\\nstrategy with μ = 3 parents and λ = 25 offspring in each generation  For ensemble pruning \\nhaving 3 parents considerably reduced the risk of premature convergence and at the same\\n\\ntime kept the evolutionary process under a reasonable selective pressure \\n\\n3  Fitness evaluation  The fitness value of each chromosome is evaluated as in Eq 2  It is an\\n\\naverage of the individual accuracies Tracc of the active EWNNs and their ensemble training\\naccuracy Ens U  where the objective is to maximize the average accuracies \\n\\nFEðChrÞ ¼ 0 5ðTracc þ EnsðUÞÞ

generations was set at 1 000  Ensemble\\n\\naccuracy was found not to improve after few hundred generations \\n\\nThe program starts with random chromosomes that are evaluated based on the fitness func-\\n\\ntion in Eq 2  The best individuals are selected as parents and thus preserved for the next gener-\\n\\nation—all other individuals are removed  Then  λ offspring are produced by mutating the\\nparents  Every offspring is evaluated and added to the next generation  The process continues\\n\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease

Classification accuracy Teacc  ensemble classification accuracy\\nETeacc  sensitivity Sens  specificity Spec and Mathew correlation coefficient MCC are reported\\nfor the three datasets  The ensemble approach improves the classification accuracy by up to\\n\\n23 7 percentage points  Teacc vs  ETeacc  compared to individual EWNN classifiers  For the\\nDDSM dataset  the ensemble approach improved the performance of the network from 89 0%\\n\\nto 95 5%  An MCC score of 91 0% also indicates a very high classification accuracy  For the\\n\\nLPD dataset the accuracy increased from 92 9% to 100%  and for the SPD dataset it increased\\n\\nfrom 66 3% to 90 0% \\n\\nWhat were the significant features identified by the process  Fig 4 is the averaged connected\\n\\nfeatures for all datasets  across 50 independent runs in EWNN  and the number of active classi-\\n\\nfiers in the EWNN-e  In a standard WNN all features are connected to every wavelons in the\\n\\nhidden layer  While in EWNNs  from Fig 4  there is some variability in how often these fea-\\n\\ntures are connected  This indicates the flexibility of pruning features  during training  at the\\n\\nhidden layer  as opposed to the input layer  for which many feature reduction methods already\\n\\nexist  For the DDSM dataset  mass margin  patient age  mass shape and assessment were the top\\nfour features that had an impact on performance—similarly to [48]  For the LPD dataset \\n\\nspread1 and D2 were the top two features—similarly to [53]  The trend of feature selection was\\nfound to be same for both the EWNN and EWNN-e networks for all datasets except SPD  For\\n\\nthe SPD dataset  Shimmerapq3 is the top feature in the ensemble network  whereas Shimmerdda\\nis the top one for the individual EWNNs  This drift in frequency of feature selection indicates\\n\\npossible significance of the feature in the ensemble domain \\n\\nShould every wavelon be fully connected  The connectivity or dimensionality of a wavelon\\n\\nis determined by the number of active or connected inputs  Fig 5 displays the sum of the wave-\\n\\nlons’ dimensions for each dataset  over 50 independent runs and  over the number of active\\n\\nclassifiers in the final EWNN-e  across the 10 folds  The frequency of each wavelon dimension\\n\\nis lower in the ensemble network  as classifiers are pruned  The ensemble networks exhibited\\n\\ndifferent trends  depending on the dataset  Interestingly  for the DDSM dataset we observed a\\n\\nreduction in the number of 6-dimensional wavelons  thus indicating that fully connected\\n\\nEWNNs were not part of the ensemble network  The frequent occurrence of wavelons with\\n\\nlower dimensions indicates that WNNs should be given the flexibility to adjust their input  in\\n\\ncontrast to a standard WNNs  where all inputs are connected [16] \\n\\nHow many classifiers are necessary to create an effective ensemble  The average number of\\n\\nEWNNs in the ensemble networks for the datasets is shown in Table 4  The ensemble networks\\n\\ncombine around 1/3  14-17  of the 50 available EWNNs  and they improved both speed and\\n\\nperformance  compared to the non-ensemble approach \\n\\nFrom Table 5  it can be concluded that the proposed method generated either competitive\\n\\nor better results in comparison to existing techniques  An advantage of EWNN-e is that it does\\n\\nnot require pre-processing for feature pruning  which is present in some of the comparison\\n\\nmethods  Given the results  it can be stated that the ensemble version of EWNN classifiers is a\\n\\nsuitable approach for predictive analysis  Just for clarification purposes  and to put the results\\n\\ninto context  for the DDSM dataset  the accuracy reported for NN-e was achieved with an\\n\\nensemble of 127 classifiers [11]  as opposed to the average of only 14 50 in the proposed\\n\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease prediction\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0192192 February 8  2018 9 / 15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmethod  That is  NN-e has a better performance for that dataset  but the classifier is much\\n\\nmore complex than the classifiers obtained by our approach \\n\\nConclusion\\nEnsemble approaches aim at combining the classification power of individual classifiers

to the advances in systemic therapies \\n\\nincluding intensive local treatment  chemotherapy  endocrine\\ntherapy  and targeted therapy  overall survival rates of breast\\ncancer have increased  however  these therapies have not\\nproduced signiﬁcant changes in the prognosis of patients with\\nbreast cancer accompanied by distant metastasis \\nThe main sites of metastasis for breast cancer are the bone \\n\\nlung  and liver  whereas metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is\\nrelatively rare  reported incidence rates are 2% to 18% of breast\\ncancer cases  Importantly  gastric metastasis from invasive\\nlobular breast carcinoma is reported to occur at a higher rate\\nthan the metastasis from invasive ductal carcinoma [2] Gastric\\ncancer has high incidence rates in Korea [1] and differentiation\\nbetween primary gastric cancer and metastatic gastric cancer\\nbased solely on clinical ﬁndings may be difﬁcult  Inappropriate\\ndiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical

for\\nmonitoring the effects of therapy in cancer patients [6] In healthy\\nindividuals  cfDNA is derived from apoptotic cells and is\\n\\nted  measuring 185 to 200 base pairs  bp  in length \\nas in

most common cancer and the\\n\\nfifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Japanese\\n\\nwomen 2 Globally  between 5% and 10% of breast cancers are meta-\\n\\nstatic at the time of diagnosis 3 and ABC  including recurrent disease\\n\\nand mBC  is incurable 4 posing a significant public health burden and\\n\\nconsiderable treatment challenges 5\\n\\nFor postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC  endocrine therapy\\n\\nwith agents such as aromatase inhibitors  eg  anastrozole  letrozole \\n\\nor exemestane  is the standard first-line treatment6 and is recom-\\n\\nmended by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guide-\\n\\nlines 7 However  current first-line endocrine therapy alone may\\n\\nprovide only modest benefit in patients with HR+ ABC  and some\\n\\npatients may not respond at all 6 indicating the need for new treat-\\n\\nment options  In a randomized phase III trial of exemestane vs anas-\\n\\ntrozole as first-line therapy in Japanese women with HR+ ABC \\n\\nmedian

populations\\nof Hispanic origin  In this pilot study  metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed\\nto establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC  Data\\nfrom 1H-NMR  GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared  Statistics showed dis-\\ncrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms  The dif-\\nferentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid  amino acid and\\nfatty acid metabolism  This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches\\nin metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabo-\\nlism  Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better\\nunderstanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic\\norigin  Particularly  the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines\\nand the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid  cPA  In addition  the mapped meta-\\nbolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-His-\\npanic women  despite racial differences \\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer  BC  remains the most frequent type of cancer and the main cause of cancer\\n\\ndeaths among women worldwide [1]  According to GLOBOCAN  breast cancer

with genes and proteins \\n\\nMetabolomics is a consolidated field that has enabled to observe differences in metabolic\\n\\nsignatures generated by a pathological state such as cancer  These differences allow to postulate\\n\\nmolecular mechanisms involved in cancer  proposing and evaluating promissory treatment\\n\\ntargets and diagnosis tools [8–10]  Although the identification of breast cancer biomarkers by\\n\\nmetabolomics is still at an early stage  exploratory studies have allowed highlighting alterations\\n\\nin aerobic glycolysis  de novo lipogenesis  glutaminolysis  glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid\\nand amino acid metabolism [11–15]  These alterations have been used to identify metabolic\\n\\nchanges associated with advanced metastatic breast cancer in cell lines [16  17] and serum\\n\\n[18]  as well as breast cancer subtypes in plasma [13  19] and tissue [13  19–21]  Moreover  the\\n\\nidentification of suitable targets for drug development in cell lines [22–24] and therapy selec-\\n\\ntion in cell lines [25] and serum [26] have also been achieved \\n\\nHigh-throughput analytical chemical techniques such as chromatography coupled to mass\\n\\nspectrometry  MS  and nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  spectroscopy [27  28] have been\\n\\nused in metabolomics  along with univariate and multivariate statistics [29  30]  in order to\\n\\nprovide information on a large number of metabolites  in particular those with altered levels\\n\\nbetween healthy subjects and cancer patients [9  31–34]  Metabolomics in BC has been mainly\\n\\nperformed by NMR and MS  according to the purpose of the study and the characteristics of\\n\\nmeasured metabolites [35]  NMR has proven useful to determine significant differences in\\n\\nserum samples  allowing a discrimination between early and metastatic BC  regarding to\\n\\namino acid  small organic molecules and general lipid content [26  36  37]  and also to predict\\n\\nBC recurrence using amino acid  fatty acid and choline levels [38]  Both GC-MS and LC-MS\\n\\nhave detected alterations that have been proposed for several biomarkers  including amino\\n\\nacids [38–41]  small organic acids [13  38] and fatty acids [26  38]  whereas lysophospholipid\\n\\n[42  43] and carnitine [13] alterations have been found only by LC-MS  In addition  alterations\\n\\nin less polar lipids  such as glycerophospholipids [42  44  45] and glycerolipids [43  46] have\\n\\nbeen reported by LC-MS using a lipidomics approach \\n\\nIn last decades  extensive research in breast cancer has been conducted in order to under-\\n\\nstand its heterogeneity  however a comprehensive metabolic profile is still required to identify\\n\\npromising underlying metabolic signatures that can be used to improve breast cancer diagno-\\n\\nsis and treatment  Besides  most studies of metabolic alterations in BC have been performed\\n\\non Asian

Neural Networks  The\\nsearch for a high quality ensemble is directed by a fitness function that incorporates the\\naccuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself  The\\nensemble approach is tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets \\none on Breast Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease  using a 10-fold cross-validation\\nstrategy  Our experimental results show that  for the first dataset  the performance was simi-\\nlar to previous studies reported in literature  On the second dataset  the Evolutionary Wave-\\nlet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous methods  The third\\ndataset is relatively new and this study is the first to report benchmark results \\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Australian women [1] \\n\\nwhile Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurological condition in Australia [2] \\n\\nThe identification and assessment process for both diseases is multi-staged  that is tedious \\n\\ntime-consuming  and challenging where data needs to be manually labeled  Such assessments\\n\\nmight also lead to misdiagnosis  In medical practice  in order to reduce the risk of misdiagno-\\n\\nsis  opinions from multiple doctors  or specialist doctors  are taken into account  A similar\\n\\napproach is used in the computational intelligence domain  where performance of prediction\\n\\nmodels  or specialist models  is improved by combining multiple models  thus creating an\\n\\nensemble of classifiers [3] \\n\\nEnsemble classifiers and their use have been an active area of research for the past two\\n\\ndecades  with Bagging [3] and Boosting [4] being two popular techniques  particularly in

sec-\\n\\ntion is then followed by the conclusions and future work \\n\\nBackground\\nWavelet Neural Networks\\n\\nWavelet Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that combine the theory of wavelets\\n\\nand neural networks [16]  In standard neural networks  weights and biases are the only param-\\n\\neters that are trained and the most common activation functions used are sigmoid  hyperbolic\\n\\ntangent and linear functions  The activation functions found in WNNs are those that belong to\\n\\nthe family of wavelet basis functions  with the most common being the Morelet and Mexican\\nhat  In addition to weights and biases  three other parameters are used in WNNs  translate \\ndilate and rotate  The use of standard gradient methods to adjust WNN parameters  in particu-\\n\\nlar the weights  biases  the translate and dilate parameters  often resulted in premature conver-\\n\\ngence [16  17]  For that reason  global optimization approaches  such as genetic algorithms\\n\\nand evolutionary programming techniques  have been used in applications such as air and\\n\\nground traffic flow [18  19]  energy consumption [20]  large scale function estimation [21] \\n\\nfunction approximation [22] and power transformer monitoring [23]  A diagram of a WNN is\\n\\nshown in Fig 1  WNNs generally have a feed-forward structure  with one hidden layer having\\n\\nm wavelons  ψm  and a neuron in the output layer  There are also n shortcut connections from\\nthe inputs to the output neuron \\n\\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks\\n\\nEWNNs were first proposed by Khan et al  [15] as a method for optimizing all WNN parame-\\n\\nters concurrently  The method was tested successfully on both simulated and real datasets [15] \\n\\nFor a detailed description of EWNN characteristics and performance  we refer the reader to\\n\\nreference [15] \\n\\nFig 2 is an example of the EWNN applied to a standard benchmark two-spiral task shown\\n\\nin Fig 2 a  Two-spiral

 While in [26] a 2-50-1 ANN was trained by employing a\\n\\nsecond-order Newton optimization method where training took only 650 epochs  In contrast \\n\\nfor EWNNs with a wavelet activation function of Morelet shown in Fig 2 b  the optimum\\n\\nresponse of the EWNNs was achieved within 9 generations and with two wavelons only  This\\n\\nindicates its potential to separate non-linear classes

training U and test V sets  The C is first trained on U where it learns\\nthe mapping process and then the performance of the C is measured on V  A multiple classifier\\nsystem  or ensemble  Ens  is composed of a set of base classifiers that are trained on the same\\ntraining dataset  and combined in a manner that improves the classification performance of\\n\\nthe system  There are two main methods for creating an ensemble  averaging and voting [27] \\n\\nAveraging is normally used for classifiers with numeric outputs  While voting is used for\\n\\nFig 1  Structure of a Wavelet Neural

task—reducing ensemble sizes  Pruned ensembles exhibit\\n\\nbetter performance and robustness with lower computational and memory costs [28]  com-\\n\\npared to traditional ensemble techniques [29  30]  The three most popular ensemble pruning\\n\\ntechniques are ranking  clustering and optimization [31]  and this study focuses on the latter \\n\\nAmong the optimization techniques for ensemble pruning the most commonly used are evolu-\\n\\ntionary algorithms  semi-definite programming and hill climbing [32–34] \\n\\nGASEN-b was one of the earliest algorithms for ensemble pruning  and was introduced by\\n\\n[32]  The ensemble is represented as a bit string  with each decision tree model using a bit  The\\n\\nbit string representation provides a direct mechanism of adding or removing classifiers  as\\n\\nopposed to a weighting mechanism with a predefined threshold  A similar approach was also\\n\\nused in [6] to select/remove classifiers from a heterogeneous pool of networks \\n\\nZhang et al  [33] chose a quadratic integer programming approach for pruning  The weights\\n\\nwere kept binary and the size of the final ensemble was prefixed  In terms of computational\\n\\ncomplexity  the algorithm could run in polynomial time \\n\\nHill climbing methods generally use either forward selection or backward elimination of\\n\\nclassifiers  and include various performance measures  e g  diversity  weighted accuracy [35–\\n\\n39]  More recently  human-like foresight has been used as a measure to prune ensembles via\\n\\nhill climbing [34] \\n\\nIn this study  a pool of optimized EWNNs is pruned using genetic algorithms so that a\\n\\nbetter prediction model is obtained  The approach follows the GASEN-b mechanism [32]\\n\\nof pruning classifiers

individual classifier  and the ensemble accuracy using the\\n\\nvoting method \\n\\nNetwork performance measures\\n\\nThere are many performance measures for binary classification problems available in the liter-\\n\\nature  Power [40] investigated those measures and generalized them for multiclass problems \\n\\nNext  we present the measures used in this work \\n\\n• Training Accuracy  Tracc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the training set U \\n\\n• Test Accuracy  Teacc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the test set V  This is also\\nknown as the classification accuracy  and expressed as Teacc =  TP + TN / P + N  TP repre-\\nsents true positive cases  i e  accurate classification of control  non-diseased  samples  TN\\n\\nrepresents true negative cases  i e

cases  mathematically\\nexpressed as Sens = TP/ TP + FN  FN is the number of false negatives and reflects the more\\nserious mistake of classifying a disease sample as control \\n\\n• Specificity  Spec  measurement of the fraction of true negative cases  mathematically repre-\\nsented as Spec = TN/ TN + FP  FP reflects the misclassification of control samples as dis-\\neased ones \\n\\n•

http //marathon csee usf edu/Mammography/\\n\\nDatabase html  with different resolutions and obtained from various hospitals [46  47]  The\\n\\nsuspicious areas on the mammograms were manually marked by two experienced radiologists \\n\\nFor analysis  these markings are represented as chain codes and hence can be extracted easily \\n\\nIn the dataset used by [48]  200 mammographic images scanned by a HOWTEK scanner at\\n\\n43 5 micron per pixel spatial resolution were downloaded and extracted via the chain code \\n\\nThat dataset had an equal number of benign and malignant samples  Even though [48] derived\\n\\n25 features from the extracted region  only 6 of the features were actually investigated in the\\n\\npresent study  in order to provide a fair comparison with previous works that used the same\\n\\ndataset [11  49]  Among those 6 features  there are 4 BIRADS  Breast Imaging Reporting and\\n\\nData System established by [50]  lexicon features  mass shape  mass margin

Dataset  LPD  This dataset  available at  http //archive ics uci edu/\\n\\nml  was acquired from the online machine learning database repository from the University of\\n\\nCalifornia at Irvine  UCI  [51  52]  It is a challenging  imbalanced dataset that has been investi-\\n\\ngated previously by several researchers [9  53–55]  It contains 195 samples  each with 22 differ-\\n\\nent biomedical

\\n\\nTraining and test sets\\n\\nFor all the datasets  the data was divided into 90% training and 10% test data  The proposed\\n\\napproach is divided into two main phases as shown in Fig 3  Phase I creates optimal EWNNs\\n\\nfrom cross validation folds conducted on the 90% training and validation data and the average\\n\\nclassification accuracy Teacc for the EWNNs was reported  The optimal EWNNs were then\\nused by next phase  Phase II uses genetic algorithm to prune the optimal EWNN classifiers\\n\\nwhere the separate test set was used and a final ensemble classification accuracy ETeacc was\\nthen reported \\n\\nIn both LPD and SPD datasets  individuals had different numbers of records  Thus  if more\\n\\nthan half of the individual’s records are classified as Parkinson’s disease  then the individual\\n\\nitself is classified as Parkinson’s disease  diseased  This approach was adopted from [45  54] in\\n\\norder to avoid over-fitting  as the frequency response of the records of the same patient are\\n\\npotentially very similar \\n\\nApproach\\n\\nPhase I  Generating optimized EWNNs \\n\\n1  EWNN initialization  An EWNN genome requires the initialization of the number of wave-\\n\\nlons  the different parameters of each wavelon  and the wavelet function s \\n\\n• The number of wavelons is critical as too many wavelons would likely result in over-fitting\\n\\nand too few would not capture the variability of the data [56]  The three datasets have been\\n\\ninvestigated in detail under different parameter settings and those are reported in [15] \\n\\nThe best configurations from that study were adopted here  The number of wavelons used\\n\\nfor each dataset is shown in Table 2 \\n\\n• Selection of an appropriate activation function depends on the data itself  but the Mexican\\n\\nhat wavelet has performed satisfactorily in many applications [56]  For the DDSM  the\\n\\npresent study uses a heterogeneous WNN with four possible activation functions  For the\\n\\nremaining case studies  we used a homogeneous WNN that uses the Mexican hat wavelet\\n\\nas activation function \\n\\n• Each wavelon is represented by matrices of

refers to the number of offspring pro-\\nduced in a generation  In  μ  λ -ES  offspring replaces the parents as the μ fittest are selected\\n\\nFig 3  Flowchart of the two phases of the approach

The value of μ and λ used for the different case studies are shown in\\nTable 2 \\n\\n3  Fitness evaluation  All individuals in the population are evaluated and sorted based on their\\n\\naccuracies and mean square error where the best individual is promoted as parent to the\\n\\nnext generation  The purpose of using two dimensional sorting is to promote networks\\n\\nwith uncorrelated evaluation metrics in generations ahead \\n\\n4  Mutation  A 1% mutation rate is used to generate new EWNNs  similar to [15]  Mutation\\n\\noccurs in three different ways  For continuous parameters  such as input weights  wavelon\\n\\nweights  translation  rotation  dilation parameters and the bias  values are perturbed by add-\\n\\ning a small percentage of the current value  For binary parameters  e g  switch  the value is\\n\\ninverted from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0  For the third type of mutation  a network input is randomly\\n\\nchanged to another input feature in the feature list  or similarly  a wavelet function is ran-\\n\\ndomly changed to another wavelet function in the list \\n\\n5  Termination condition  The simulations stop at 2 000 generations  We observed that this\\n\\nvalue is sufficient for the evolutionary process to converge to a high-quality solution  The\\n\\noptimal EWNNs are later used in Phase II to create the ensembles  A total of 50 indepen-\\n\\ndent evolutionary runs were

uses\\n\\nanother genetic algorithm as follows \\n\\n1  Chromosome Chr representation  A k-bit string is used to represent an ensemble with the\\noptimized EWNNs  A bit value of 1 indicates that the classifier is actively used in the ensem-\\n\\nble  0 otherwise \\n\\n2  Population size  After a number of preliminary tests  we decided for an  μ+λ -evolutionary\\nstrategy with μ = 3 parents and λ = 25 offspring in each generation  For ensemble pruning \\nhaving 3 parents considerably reduced the risk of premature convergence and at the same\\n\\ntime kept the evolutionary process under a reasonable selective pressure \\n\\n3  Fitness evaluation  The fitness value of each chromosome is evaluated as in Eq 2  It is an\\n\\naverage of the individual accuracies Tracc of the active EWNNs

set to 1% for all simulations  and the strategy\\n\\nused was bit-swap \\n\\n5  Termination condition  The limit for the number of generations was set at 1 000  Ensemble\\n\\naccuracy was found not to improve after few hundred generations \\n\\nThe program starts with random chromosomes that are evaluated based on the fitness func-\\n\\ntion in Eq 2  The best individuals are selected as parents and thus preserved for the next gener-\\n\\nation—all other individuals are removed  Then  λ offspring are produced by mutating the\\nparents  Every offspring is evaluated and added to the next generation

Teacc vs  ETeacc  compared to individual EWNN classifiers  For the\\nDDSM dataset  the ensemble approach improved the performance of the network from 89 0%\\n\\nto 95 5%  An MCC score of 91 0% also indicates a very high classification accuracy  For the\\n\\nLPD dataset the accuracy increased from 92 9% to 100%  and for the SPD dataset it increased\\n\\nfrom 66 3% to 90 0% \\n\\nWhat were the significant features identified by the process  Fig 4 is the averaged connected\\n\\nfeatures for all datasets  across 50 independent runs in EWNN  and the number of active classi-\\n\\nfiers in the EWNN-e  In a standard WNN all features are connected to every wavelons in the\\n\\nhidden layer  While in EWNNs  from Fig 4  there is some variability in how often these fea-\\n\\ntures are connected  This indicates the flexibility of pruning features  during training  at the\\n\\nhidden layer  as opposed to the input layer  for which many feature reduction methods already\\n\\nexist  For the DDSM dataset  mass margin  patient age  mass shape and assessment were the top\\nfour features that had an impact on performance—similarly to [48]  For the LPD dataset \\n\\nspread1 and D2 were the top two features—similarly to [53]  The trend of feature selection was\\nfound to be same for both the EWNN and EWNN-e networks for all datasets except SPD  For\\n\\nthe SPD dataset  Shimmerapq3 is the top feature in the ensemble network  whereas Shimmerdda\\nis the top one for the individual EWNNs  This drift in frequency of feature selection indicates\\n\\npossible significance of the feature in the ensemble domain \\n\\nShould every wavelon be fully connected  The connectivity or dimensionality of a wavelon\\n\\nis determined by the number of active or connected inputs  Fig 5 displays the sum of the wave-\\n\\nlons’ dimensions for each dataset  over 50 independent runs and  over the number of active\\n\\nclassifiers in the final EWNN-e  across the 10 folds  The frequency of each wavelon dimension\\n\\nis lower in the ensemble network  as classifiers are pruned  The ensemble networks exhibited\\n\\ndifferent trends  depending on the dataset  Interestingly  for the DDSM dataset we observed a\\n\\nreduction in the number of 6-dimensional wavelons  thus indicating that fully connected\\n\\nEWNNs were not part of the ensemble network  The frequent occurrence of wavelons with\\n\\nlower dimensions indicates that WNNs should be given the flexibility to adjust their input  in\\n\\ncontrast to a standard WNNs  where all inputs are connected [16] \\n\\nHow many classifiers are necessary to create an effective ensemble  The average number of\\n\\nEWNNs in the ensemble networks for the datasets is shown in Table 4  The ensemble networks\\n\\ncombine around 1/3  14-17  of the 50 available EWNNs  and they improved both speed and\\n\\nperformance  compared to the non-ensemble approach \\n\\nFrom Table 5  it can be concluded that the proposed method generated either competitive\\n\\nor better results in comparison to existing techniques  An advantage of EWNN-e is that it does\\n\\nnot require pre-processing for feature pruning  which is present in some of the comparison\\n\\nmethods  Given the results  it can be stated that the ensemble version of EWNN classifiers is a\\n\\nsuitable approach for predictive analysis  Just for clarification purposes  and to put the results\\n\\ninto context  for the DDSM dataset  the accuracy reported for NN-e was achieved with an\\n\\nensemble of 127 classifiers [11]  as opposed to the average of only 14 50 in the

group also showed the lowest viable\\ntumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index in histopathologic analyses \\n\\nConclusion\\nWe firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001 effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascu-\\nlarization in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model  It may provide a future treatment option\\nfor breast cancer \\n\\nIntroduction\\nTumor angiogenesis is a potential target for anti-cancer therapy  as it plays an essential role in\\n\\noxygen and nutrient supply [1  2]  Antibodies against either vascular endothelial growth fac-\\n\\ntors  VEGFs  or their receptors have been developed to target tumor angiogenesis [3  4]  Beva-\\n\\ncizumab  the first approved anti-angiogenic agent to target VEGF itself  achieved notable\\n\\nsuccess as a novel targeted drug to treat several cancers  including colon  renal  and non-small\\n\\ncell lung cancer  Although its therapeutic efficacy is limited  it is generally used as part of a\\n\\ncombination treatment regimen \\n\\nTargeting VEGF receptors  VEGFRs  is an alternative approach to inhibit angiogenesis in\\n\\ntumors  In particular  inhibition of the VEGFR-2/kinase insert domain receptor  KDR  has\\n\\npotential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling regulator of VEGF/\\n\\nVEGFR pathways [5]  From this perspective  TTAC-0001  a human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR\\n\\nmonoclonal antibody  was developed  TTAC-0001 binds to the VEGF-binding domain of\\n\\nVEGFR-2 and neutralizes the biological activity of VEGFR-2 by blocking the binding of VEGF\\n\\n[6]  Preclinical research revealed potential anti-tumor activity of TTAC-0001 in colorectal \\n\\nnon-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma tumor models [6–10]  Recently  a phase I clinical\\n\\ntrial of TTAC-0001 was completed  and a phase IIa trial is ongoing  However  there have been\\n\\nno previous studies of TTAC-0001 for breast cancer \\n\\nIn terms of chemotherapy for breast cancer  the major challenge is to develop an effective\\n\\nregimen for triple-negative breast cancer [11]  Bevacizumab had been incorporated as a\\n\\nsecond-line chemotherapy regimen for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer  but was\\n\\nrevoked by the FDA due to inadequate therapeutic effect  suggesting that targeting the\\n\\nVEGF ligand itself may not be the best strategy [12  13]  Therefore  an alternative approach \\n\\ninhibition of VEGFR-2/KDR  is worthy of investigation for treatment of triple-negative\\n\\nbreast cancer \\n\\nBioimaging plays important roles in anti-cancer drug research [14  15]  Multiple modalities\\n\\nsuch as magnetic resonance imaging  positron emission tomography have been applied for the\\n\\noncologic drug development and each modality showed its own values to facilitate the devel-\\n\\nopment steps  Particularly  size measurement with ultrasonography  US  provides more accu-\\n\\nrate values of regressed tumor volumes [16  17] when the drugs are treated and the utilization\\n\\nof optical imaging  fluorescence and bioluminescence  enables the studies of mode of action\\n\\nmechanisms and biodistribution of the drugs [18] \\n\\nThe validation of TTAC-0001 in triple-negative breast cancer has not been performed yet \\n\\nTherefore  we aimed to investigate the drug mechanism and anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-\\n\\n0001  a novel anti-angiogenic agent  in a mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-\\n\\nmodal bioimaging \\n\\nDrug mechanism and efficacy of TTAC-0001 in mouse breast cancer\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone

n = 5 \\n\\nLabeling of TTAC-0001  To perform fluorescent labeling of TTAC-0001  we used a com-\\n\\nmercial kit  Alexa Fluor1 647 Antibody Labelling Kit  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Waltham \\n\\nMA  USA  according to the manufacturer’s protocol  Briefly  we induced a conjugation reac-\\n\\ntion between the Alexa Fluor1 647 reactive dye and TTAC-0001  and the purified labeled\\n\\nTTAC-0001 was collected  To determine the degree of labeling  the concentration of the dye\\n\\nwas calculated based on absorbance at 280 and 650 nm  The collected labeled drug was stabi-\\n\\nlized at room temperature for 1 h and then intravenously injected into the mice \\n\\nSerial fluorescence imaging  Biodistribution of Alexa Fluor1 647-labeled TTAC-0001\\n\\nwas performed using the IVIS Lumina II machine  PerkinElmer  Waltham  MA  USA  Mice\\n\\nwere anesthetized with 1% isoflurane  Forane1  Choongwae  Korea  and Alexa Fluor1\\n\\n647-labeled TTAC-0001 was intravenously injected at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg  Serial fluores-\\n\\ncence images were then acquired at baseline and at 1  2  4  and 8 h and 1  2  4  and 6 days after\\n\\ndrug injection  Imaging was performed with an exposure time of 1 s and an f/stop of 1  Using\\n\\nLiving Image1 4 2 software  Caliper Life Sciences  Hopkinton  MA  USA  the peak total sig-\\n\\nnal was measured by placing regions of interest  ROIs  at the tumors  which reflected the accu-\\n\\nmulated amount of Alexa Fluor1 647-labeled drug \\n\\nMode of action for the anti-angiogenic effect\\n\\nExperimental groups  For evaluating the mode of action  the

anti-angiogenic effect of TTAC-0001  It is based on the fact\\nthat VEGF secreted from Matrigel tumor cells exerts pro-angiogenic effects on the surround-\\n\\ning tissue  thus promoting neovascular development that is visualized in the Matrigel  If a drug\\n\\ninhibits the effect of VEGF by inhibiting either VEGF or VEGFR  then the decreased levels of\\n\\nneovascular development in the Matrigel can be evaluated \\n\\nFig 1  Flow chart of the experimental protocol of the animal study \\n\\nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0187063 g001\\n\\nDrug mechanism and efficacy of TTAC-0001 in mouse

into\\nthe right mammary fat pad of Balb/c nude mice  n = 5  A single 2 or 10 mg/kg treatment of\\n\\nTTAC-0001 or saline was administered to the respective groups by intravenous injection after\\n\\nimplantation  After 10 days  Matrigel plugs were removed and frozen for immunofluorescence\\n\\nanalysis  To measure the hemoglobin  Hb  content  excised plugs  n = 5 plugs/group  were cut\\n\\ninto small pieces and placed in 500 uL of cold  distilled water at 4˚C overnight to liquefy the\\n\\nMatrigel  Specimens were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 mins  and the supernatant was col-\\n\\nlected  Hb content was quantified using a Hb assay kit  Sigma-Aldrich  and\\n\\nspectrophotometry \\n\\nImmunofluoroscence staining  Cryosections  30 um  of the removed plugs

Life Technologies  Carlsbad  CA  USA  according to the manufacturer’s protocol \\n\\nThe immunofluorescence images were analyzed using NIH-Image J software  National\\n\\nInstitutes of Health  Bethesda  Maryland  USA  A free-hand ROI was drawn around the\\n\\ntumor  and CD31-positive cells were selected using the global histogram-derived thresholding\\n\\nmethod [19]  The percentage area of CD31-positive cells was calculated by dividing the area of\\n\\nthe CD31-positive cells by the area of the tumor ROI \\n\\nAnti-tumor efficacy\\n\\nTo evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the drugs  we used two types of cells and imaging meth-\\n\\nods as follows   1  MDA-MB-231 cells for ultrasonography  US  evaluation and  2  MDA-MB-\\n\\n231+luc cells for bioluminescence imaging  BLI  The reason why we used imaging for tumor\\n\\nmonitoring is that the orthotopic tumors in the mammary fat pad may be barely visible  thus\\n\\nmaking it very difficult to measure tumor size if the tumor decreases during treatment  In\\n\\naddition  utilization of both US and BLI modalities allows a more accurate evaluation of the\\n\\ntumor volume and viability  respectively \\n\\nExperimental groups  To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the drugs  tumors were\\n\\nengrafted into 80 mice  Of these  56 mice  70%  that met the tumor volume criteria  70–130\\n\\nmm3  were selected and randomly assigned to four groups  which were treated with saline\\n\\n control group  bevacizumab 10 mg/kg  BVZ-10 group  low-dose  2 mg/kg  TTAC-0001\\n\\n TTAC-2 group  and high-dose  10 mg/kg  TTAC-0001  TTAC-10 group \\n\\nMice were monitored daily for up to 30 days after treatment for tumor volume  body\\n\\nweight  and general body condition  such as appearance  food/water intake  respiration  and\\n\\nambulation  Animals were euthanized when they showed signs of distress  when the tumors\\n\\nwere>2 cm in diameter  when the weight loss was >15% of body weight  or when the tumor\\n\\ninterfered with the ability to eat or drink \\n\\nUltrasonography  All US examinations were performed by a board-certified radiologist\\n\\n K W K  using an iU22 unit  Philips Healthcare  Bothell  WA  USA  with a 20 MHz linear\\n\\ntransducer  To assess tumor volume  we measured the longest diameter of the tumor on the\\n\\naxial and coronal axes and the height of the tumor every 3 days during the 1 month follow-up \\n\\nWe calculated the tumor volume according to the following formula  4 19 × axial longest\\ndiameter × coronal longest diameter × height \\n\\nBioluminescence

\\n\\nHistopathologic study  All animals were euthanized at day 30 after treatment  The\\n\\nextracted tumors were perfused with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS \\n\\nTumors were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm at the largest\\ntumor area \\n\\nTo evaluate the tumor morphology and extent of viable tumor  hematoxylin and eosin\\n\\n H&E  staining was performed  In representative sections of the tumor  H&E images were ana-\\n\\nlyzed using NIH-Image J software  The viable tumor cells were regarded as cells stained with\\n\\nH&E in both the nucleus and cytoplasm  whereas necrotic/apoptotic areas were regarded as\\n\\ncells stained with eosin only or no stain  After drawing ROIs around the whole tumor  viable\\n\\ncells were selected based on the hematoxylin staining of the nuclei using the global histogram-\\n\\nderived thresholding method [19]  The percentage of viable tumor area was calculated by\\n\\ndividing the area of viable cells by the whole tumor area \\n\\nTo evaluate the microvessel areas  immunohistochemical staining for a vascular endothelial\\n\\nantigen  CD31  was performed using a primary rabbit anti-mouse CD31 antibody

using the global histogram-derived thresholding method [19] \\n\\nWe set the threshold to select the hematoxylin-stained nuclei and count the number of whole\\n\\ntumor cells  Then we reset the color threshold to select the brownish nuclei and count the\\n\\nnumber of Ki-67-stained tumor cells  The Ki-67 index was calculated by dividing the number\\n\\nof Ki-67-positive cells by the number of

\\n\\nIntroduction\\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide [1]  The etiology\\n\\nof female breast cancer is multifactorial  and includes reproductive  genetic  lifestyle  and envi-\\n\\nronmental factors [2–5] \\n\\nIn North Africa  as in many regions that are either developing or in epidemiological transi-\\n\\ntion  breast cancer incidence rates have clearly risen [6]  In Morocco  breast cancer remains\\n\\nthe most common cancer in women  constituting about 35 8% of all new cancer diagnoses in\\n\\nwomen [7]  According to the most recent report of the cancer registry in Casablanca  the age-\\n\\nstandardized incidence rate of breast cancer increased from 35 0 to 49 5 per 100 000 women\\n\\nbetween 2004 and 2012  showing an annual increase of 3 18%  The most widely proposed\\n\\nexplanations for this increase are changes in reproductive behaviors  smaller number of chil-\\n\\ndren  shorter duration of breastfeeding  higher age at first pregnancy  and in lifestyle and die-\\n\\ntary habits  higher obesity rates  among Moroccan women in the past three decades [8–10] \\n\\nNumerous epidemiological studies performed throughout the world have confirmed the\\n\\nrole of many reproductive factors  such as age at menarche  age at first pregnancy  age at men-\\n\\nopause  parity  and breastfeeding  in the etiology of breast cancer [2 11 12] \\n\\nHowever  evidence suggests that international variation in the burden of breast cancer\\n\\nreflects differences in the patterns of risk factors [13]  In the Moroccan context  the role of\\n\\nwell-known reproductive factors in breast cancer remains poorly documented  and it is proba-\\n\\nble that unidentified exposures specific to Moroccan women may play an important role \\n\\nThe aim of this case–control study was to explore the relationship between menstrual and\\n\\nreproductive factors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan women in the Fez region  To the best\\n\\nof our knowledge  this is one of the first epidemiological studies on risk factors for breast can-\\n\\ncer in Morocco \\n\\nMethods\\nStudy design and setting\\n\\nThe Fez Breast Cancer Study is a case–control study  conducted at the Hassan II University\\n\\nHospital of Fez  ranked as one of the most important medical centers in Morocco  covering\\n\\nmore than 3 million people in the Fez region \\n\\nIn this study  a total of 474 women  237 cases and 237 age-matched controls  were recruited\\n\\nbetween January 2014 and April 2015 \\n\\nStudy subjects\\n\\nCases were patients recently diagnosed with histologically confirmed breast cancer  all conse-\\n\\ncutive cases  admitted during the study period to the Medical Oncology Center at the Univer-\\n\\nsity Hospital of Fez  which is a referral center for breast cancer in the region \\n\\nControls were healthy women with no history of cancer  who accompanied patients to the\\n\\nconsultations department at the University Hospital of Fez  This department provides health\\n\\nconsultations to patients for various medical and surgical specialties  Women who accompa-\\n\\nnied patients with any type of cancer were excluded from this study  Control subjects were\\n\\nReproductive factors and breast cancer in the Fez region  Morocco\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0191333 January 16  2018 2 / 12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nindividually matched to cases by age  age at cancer diagnosis ± 3 years  and they were\\nrecruited at approximately the same time as the recruitment of cases \\n\\nBecause of the difficulty of recruiting some controls aged 60 years or older among the\\n\\nwomen accompanying patients to the hospital  women randomly selected at the consultations\\n\\ndepartment were asked whether they could provide the telephone numbers and addresses of\\n\\nother  older women  who could potentially be recruited  Women meeting the age requirement\\n\\nwere called by telephone  checked for inclusion criteria  and invited to participate in this\\n\\nstudy  The socioeconomic characteristics such as income and education level of controls\\n\\nrecruited with this method are approximately the same as those of other controls  data not\\n\\nshown \\n\\nThe participation rate in this study was 97 1%  237/244  for cases and 92 5%  237/256  for\\n\\ncontrols \\n\\nEthical considerations\\n\\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hassan II University Hospital of Fez \\n\\nParticipation in this study was strictly voluntary  and all subjects were informed about the\\n\\nright to withdraw at any time without giving an explanation  All information collected from\\n\\nparticipants was kept confidential  The Fez Breast Cancer Study was conducted according to\\n\\nthe guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki  Written informed consent to participate in the\\n\\nstudy was obtained from all study participants before the interviews were conducted \\n\\nData collection and measurements\\n\\nData were collected through face-to-face interviews by six trained interviewers  The pre-tested\\n\\nstructured questionnaire included information on sociodemographic characteristics  e g  age \\n\\neducational level  marital status  area of residence  occupation  monthly household income \\n\\nmenstrual and reproductive history  e g  age at menarche  regularity of menstrual cycle  age at\\n\\nmenopause  parity  age at first full-term pregnancy  history of abortions  history of miscar-\\n\\nriages  use of oral contraceptives  breastfeeding  postmenopausal hormone use  family history\\n\\nof breast cancer in first- and second-degree relatives  alcohol consumption  smoking  and pas-\\n\\nsive smoking  the inhalation of tobacco smoke from people who are smoking nearby in the\\n\\nhome or at work \\n\\nCurrent weight and height were measured by the interviewers according to the recommen-\\n\\ndations of Lohman et al   1988  [14]  Body mass index  BMI  was calculated as the weight in\\n\\nkilograms divided by the square of the height in meters  BMI was classified using cut-off points\\n\\nrecommended by WHO [15]

of expo-\\n\\nsure to estrogen and progesterone experienced by these women [12] \\n\\nIn agreement with results from another case–control study in the region [20]  our study did\\n\\nnot find a statistically significant association between oral contraceptive use and risk of breast\\n\\ncancer  However  some previous studies found that oral contraceptive use was associated with\\n\\nan increased risk of breast cancer [46 47]  Age at starting oral contraceptive use might be deter-\\n\\nminant in the association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer risk  however  we\\n\\ndid not have information on that variable  so we were unable to further assess its effect in our\\n\\nstudy \\n\\nThe relationship between history of abortions and breast cancer risk is controversial\\n\\n[48]  In the current study  we found that history of abortions is not significantly associated\\n\\nwith breast cancer risk  This result is in line with a meta-analysis of 53 epidemiological\\n\\nstudies  including 83 000 women with breast cancer from 16 countries [49]  However  a\\n\\nrecent meta-analysis conducted in China reported a positive association between breast can-\\n\\ncer risk and induced abortion [50]  More details about abortion  number  age at abortion \\n\\nmay provide important information on the relationship between abortion and breast cancer\\n\\nrisk \\n\\nOur study has some limitations  First  due to the retrospective nature of this study  most of\\n\\nour data were self-reported by women  and could be subject to recall bias  However  women\\n\\nwere not aware of potential risk factors for breast cancer  and therefore measurement error is\\n\\nmost likely to be random  non-differential misclassification  Another limitation is the rela-\\n\\ntively small number of cases and controls  which impaired stratified analysis by menopausal\\n\\nstatus  and factors with small effect on breast cancer risk may have been missed because of low\\n\\nstatistical power  In addition  considering that cases were significantly more likely to live in a\\n\\nrural area and to have a lower monthly household income  compared with controls  the possi-\\n\\nbility of selection bias cannot be ruled out in this study \\n\\nThe probable explanation is that controls were recruited from a consultations department\\n\\nlocated in an urban area  and those accompanying patients to this department are more likely\\n\\nto reside in an urban area and consequently their socioeconomic status may have been rela-\\n\\ntively high  The epidemiological transition and the rise of chronic diseases associated with\\n\\nurban lifestyles that are beginning to be seen among Moroccan women of lower socioeco-\\n\\nnomic status may be another possible explanation for this difference  It is therefore particularly\\n\\nimportant to explore the relationship between the socioeconomic level and breast cancer risk\\n\\nin the Moroccan context \\n\\nMoreover  in this study some variables were excluded from the analysis  due to the low\\n\\nnumber of women with certain habits in the region of the study  the frequency of postmeno-\\n\\npausal hormone use was 1 68% in cases and 0 84% in controls  the frequency of smoking was\\n\\n4 64% in cases and 0 42% in controls  and the frequency of alcohol consumption was 0 00% in\\n\\ncases and 0 42% in controls \\n\\nThis study has several strengths  including an age-matched case–control design  a high par-\\n\\nticipation rate in cases and controls  and histological confirmation of breast cancer  Moreover \\n\\nthis is the first epidemiological study to investigate the relationship between reproductive fac-\\n\\ntors and risk of breast cancer in the Fez region \\n\\nOur study confirms the role of established reproductive factors for breast cancer in Moroc-\\n\\ncan women  Studies exploring changes in the pattern of breast cancer risk factors in Morocco\\n\\n[8 10] suggest that adoption of a Western lifestyle  birth-control policies  and changes in die-\\n\\ntary habits might have resulted in earlier age at menarche  later age of marriage and first preg-\\n\\nnancy  and a decline in fertility \\n\\nReproductive factors and breast cancer in the Fez region  Morocco\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0191333 January 16  2018 8 / 12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally  the results of this study identified some susceptible groups at high risk of breast can-\\n\\ncer  Preventive interventions and screening should focus on these groups as a priority  These\\n\\nresults should be confirmed in a larger  multicenter study to support the generalization of the\\n\\nresults to all Moroccan women \\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the staff of the

kinases  MSKs  are important substrates of the mitogen-activated protein kinase \\n MAPK -activated protein kinase family  MSK1 and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases  with MSK1 \\nbeing suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation  cell cycle progression  cell migration  invasion \\nand tumour growth  The aim of the current study was to assess

genetic variation  Early-onset\\nbreast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast cancers in Asian populations \\nbut the reason for this is unclear  We aimed to examine miRNA expression profiles in differ-\\nent age-onset groups and pathological subtypes in Asian breast cancer \\n\\nMethods\\nAt the first stage  10 samples  tumor  n = 6  normal tissue  n = 4  were analyzed with an\\nAgilent microRNA 470 probe microarray  Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that\\nwere significantly altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review\\nwere further validated by quantitative real-time PCR  qPCR  of 145 breast cancer sam-\\nples at the second stage of the process  Correlations between clinicopathological\\nparameters of breast cancer patients from different age groups and candidate miRNA\\nexpression were elucidated \\n\\nResults\\nIn the present study  the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group  and\\nan onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates  For all breast can-\\ncer patients  miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated  and miR-21  miR-200a  miR-\\n200c  and miR-141 were up-regulated  In very young patients  age   1 5 and the t-test\\np value was   35  in more than\\n33 3% of samples  and were excluded from the analysis  For the remaining 79 miRNAs  raw Ct\\ndata were converted to 39-Ct normalized by global median normalization before further analy-\\nsis [14]  The differential expressed miRNAs were selected based on fold change  > 2-fold  t-\\ntest  p  50\\n\\ny/o  The median

\\n\\nHowever  there still no specific miRNAs identified in luminal A subtype from our study\\n\\n Table 8  Treatment strategies for triple-negative breast cancer were limited due to the lack of\\n\\neffective therapeutic targets  We discovered that miR-532-5p was up-regulated in the triple\\n\\nnegative group  miR-532-5p inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the CXCL2\\n\\noncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [47]  However  it promotes cell growth  migration and\\n\\ninvasion in gastric cancer cells and melanoma by down-regulating RUNX3 [48  49]  The role\\n\\nof miR532-5p could be a probable biomarker for prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer \\n\\nPrognostic analyses in many reports have shown that after adjusting for race  histological\\n\\ngrade  stage  hormone status and treatment  age was still an independent risk factor related to\\n\\nprognosis [5  50]  Middle-aged patients have better overall survival than younger and elderly\\n\\npatients  Generally  this is most likely a result of early disease detection  less aggressive sub-\\n\\ntypes and better therapy tolerance [51] \\n\\nIn this study  miR-30c was up-regulated in the middle-aged group  miR-30c targets cyto-\\n\\nskeleton network genes and regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [52]  It has also\\n\\nbeen reported to be an independent predictor of advanced breast cancer patients with tamoxi-\\n\\nfen treatment response and longer progression-free survival [53]  This miRNA alteration may\\n\\nbe one of the reasons leading to better survival in middle-aged breast cancer patients  Further-\\n\\nmore  our results identified miR-30c up-regulation in the HER2-negtive group  As the luminal\\n\\nA group was the major proportion  78 2%  of HER2-negative tumors in our study  This\\n\\nimplies that miR-30c up-regulation is related to good prognosis in breast cancer patients \\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this study  we revealed differential miRNAs expression between age groups and subtypes of\\n\\nbreast cancer in Taiwan  Some specific miRNAs limited to an individual group may be\\n\\nstrongly associated with their clinical presentation  We also found that evolutionarily con-\\n\\nserved miRNA clusters were up-regulated in very young adults  which may target some genes\\n\\nto initiate malignancy transformation  Young age was independently as a poor prognostic fac-\\n\\ntor in long term follow-up  Less miRNA dysregulation was found in the postmenopausal\\n\\ngroup  In other words  miRNAs may play a particularly important role in tumor initiation in\\n\\nbreast cancers in very young patients compared with other age groups \\n\\nCurrently  miRNA is not only a predictor of chemoresistance and chemosensitivity but cir-\\n\\nculating miRNA could also be used as a biomarker for early cancer detection as well as subtype\\n\\nprediction  This study could provide information for risk prediction of early-onset breast can-\\n\\ncer and research of ethnic diversity and therapeutic applications \\n\\nSupporting information\\nS1 Fig  Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 54 differentially expressed miRNAs in
