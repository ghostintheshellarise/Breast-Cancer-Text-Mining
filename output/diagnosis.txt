TI  - Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer, mimicking primary gastric
      cancer: A case report.
LID - e0258
AB  - Rationale:: Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer is relatively 
      rare, commonly presented among multiple metastases, several years after primary
      diagnosis of breast cancer. Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronously
      presented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastric
      cancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required. Patient
      concerns:: A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because of right
      breast mass and progressive dyspepsia. Diagnoses:: Invasive lobular carcinoma of 
      breast was diagnosed on core needle biopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse
      scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrum and diagnosed as poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronous double primary breast and gastric cancers
      were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical
      studies of selected antibodies, including those of estrogen receptors, gross
      cystic disease fluid protein-15, and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2,
      were studied. As a result, gastric lesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric
      cancer originating from breast. Interventions:: Right breast conserving surgery
      was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to
      relieve the patient's symptoms. Systemic chemotherapy with combined
      administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Outcomes:: Forty-one 
      months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoing the same therapy. No 
      recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast and evidence of a partial
      remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed on follow-up studies
      without new metastatic lesions. Lessons:: Clinical suspicion, repeat endoscopic
      biopsy, and detailed histological analysis, including immunohistochemistry, are
      necessary for diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer from the breast.

TI  - The prognostic value of circulating cell-free DNA in breast cancer: A
      meta-analysis.
LID - e0197
AB  - Background:: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma or serum by
      noninvasive procedures can serve as a “liquid biopsy” and has potential as a
      biomarker for the tumor burden and survival prediction of breast cancer (BC).
      However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The 
      aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and
      survival outcome. Methods:: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and
      Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic
      utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics,
      relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were
      extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the
      Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
      Results:: This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127
      patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations between
      cfDNA and OS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.83–3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR = 2.73, 95%
      CI, 2.04–3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in the
      studies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that the
      adjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83–3.51), which is close to the original HR.
      Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker in
      patients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source,
      detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area. Conclusions:: Our
      meta-analysis indicates that cfDNA is a strong predictive and prognostic marker
      in patients with BC.

TI  - Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first‐line treatment for advanced
      breast cancer: A Japanese phase II study.
PG  - 803-13
AB  - This single‐arm, open‐label, phase II study in 42 Japanese postmenopausal
      patients with estrogen receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2‐negative (ER+/HER2−) advanced breast cancer evaluated the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of first‐line palbociclib (125 mg once daily, 3 weeks on/1 week 
      off) coadministered with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily). Primary endpoint of
      investigator‐assessed 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) probability was
      75.0% (90% CI, 61.3%‐84.4%), far surpassing the 40% lower limit of the 90% CI
      supporting efficacy. Median duration of treatment was 438 days. Among secondary
      efficacy measures, median PFS was not reached (95% CI, 16.7: not estimable),
      17/42 patients (40.5%) had an objective response, 36/42 (85.7%) maintained
      disease control, and 27/42 (64.3%) remained in follow‐up. Median overall survival
      was not reached, and 1‐year survival probability was 92.9% (95% CI, 79.5%‐97.6%).
      Results of intensive pharmacokinetics in a subset of 6 patients showed
      palbociclib steady‐state mean area under the plasma concentration‐time curve over
      the dosing interval [τ] and mean maximum plasma concentration were 1979 ng·h/mL
      and 124.7 ng/mL, respectively. For day 15 plasma samples from cycles 1 and 2,
      geometric mean of the within‐patient mean trough concentration was 90.1 ng/mL.
      The most common treatment‐related adverse events were neutropenia (100%) and
      stomatitis (73.8%). There was 1 case of treatment‐related febrile neutropenia.
      Toxicities were generally tolerated and manageable by dose modifications and/or
      medical care. Efficacy and safety of first‐line palbociclib plus letrozole
      therapy is supported in Japanese postmenopausal patients with treatment‐naive
      ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer.

TI  - Ultrasound combined with fine needle aspiration cytology for the assessment of
      axillary lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer.
LID - e9855
AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine
      needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes 
      in patients with early stage breast cancer (BC) among the Chinese Han female
      population.Around 124 patients with early stage BC were included in this
      retrospective study. All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients with
      proven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B).
      In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5 hours prior
      to the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive
      value (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%,
      respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%,
      respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, and
      PPV between the 2 procedures (P < .05).The results of this study demonstrated
      that USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALND
      or SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.

TI  - Multiplatform plasma metabolic and lipid fingerprinting of breast cancer: A pilot
      control-case study in Colombian Hispanic women.
LID - e0190958
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease associated with metabolic
      reprogramming. The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from
      Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and
      lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint
      of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were
      combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and
      healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites
      were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid
      metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in
      metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts 
      in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could
      contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC 
      in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the
      up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of
      cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in
      breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic
      women, despite racial differences.
