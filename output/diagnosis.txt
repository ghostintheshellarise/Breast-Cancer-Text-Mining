TI  - Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer, mimicking primary gastric
      cancer: A case report.
LID - e0258
AB  - Rationale:: Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer is relatively 
      rare, commonly presented among multiple metastases, several years after primary
      diagnosis of breast cancer. Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronously
      presented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastric
      cancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required. Patient
      concerns:: A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because of right
      breast mass and progressive dyspepsia. Diagnoses:: Invasive lobular carcinoma of 
      breast was diagnosed on core needle biopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse
      scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrum and diagnosed as poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronous double primary breast and gastric cancers
      were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical
      studies of selected antibodies, including those of estrogen receptors, gross
      cystic disease fluid protein-15, and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2,
      were studied. As a result, gastric lesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric
      cancer originating from breast. Interventions:: Right breast conserving surgery
      was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to
      relieve the patient's symptoms. Systemic chemotherapy with combined
      administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Outcomes:: Forty-one 
      months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoing the same therapy. No 
      recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast and evidence of a partial
      remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed on follow-up studies
      without new metastatic lesions. Lessons:: Clinical suspicion, repeat endoscopic
      biopsy, and detailed histological analysis, including immunohistochemistry, are
      necessary for diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer from the breast.

TI  - The prognostic value of circulating cell-free DNA in breast cancer: A
      meta-analysis.
LID - e0197
AB  - Background:: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma or serum by
      noninvasive procedures can serve as a “liquid biopsy” and has potential as a
      biomarker for the tumor burden and survival prediction of breast cancer (BC).
      However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The 
      aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and
      survival outcome. Methods:: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and
      Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic
      utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics,
      relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were
      extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the
      Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
      Results:: This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127
      patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations between
      cfDNA and OS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.83–3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR = 2.73, 95%
      CI, 2.04–3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in the
      studies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that the
      adjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83–3.51), which is close to the original HR.
      Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker in
      patients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source,
      detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area. Conclusions:: Our
      meta-analysis indicates that cfDNA is a strong predictive and prognostic marker
      in patients with BC.

TI  - Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first‐line treatment for advanced
      breast cancer: A Japanese phase II study.
PG  - 803-13
AB  - This single‐arm, open‐label, phase II study in 42 Japanese postmenopausal
      patients with estrogen receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2‐negative (ER+/HER2−) advanced breast cancer evaluated the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of first‐line palbociclib (125 mg once daily, 3 weeks on/1 week 
      off) coadministered with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily). Primary endpoint of
      investigator‐assessed 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) probability was
      75.0% (90% CI, 61.3%‐84.4%), far surpassing the 40% lower limit of the 90% CI
      supporting efficacy. Median duration of treatment was 438 days. Among secondary
      efficacy measures, median PFS was not reached (95% CI, 16.7: not estimable),
      17/42 patients (40.5%) had an objective response, 36/42 (85.7%) maintained
      disease control, and 27/42 (64.3%) remained in follow‐up. Median overall survival
      was not reached, and 1‐year survival probability was 92.9% (95% CI, 79.5%‐97.6%).
      Results of intensive pharmacokinetics in a subset of 6 patients showed
      palbociclib steady‐state mean area under the plasma concentration‐time curve over
      the dosing interval [τ] and mean maximum plasma concentration were 1979 ng·h/mL
      and 124.7 ng/mL, respectively. For day 15 plasma samples from cycles 1 and 2,
      geometric mean of the within‐patient mean trough concentration was 90.1 ng/mL.
      The most common treatment‐related adverse events were neutropenia (100%) and
      stomatitis (73.8%). There was 1 case of treatment‐related febrile neutropenia.
      Toxicities were generally tolerated and manageable by dose modifications and/or
      medical care. Efficacy and safety of first‐line palbociclib plus letrozole
      therapy is supported in Japanese postmenopausal patients with treatment‐naive
      ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer.

TI  - Ultrasound combined with fine needle aspiration cytology for the assessment of
      axillary lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer.
LID - e9855
AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine
      needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes 
      in patients with early stage breast cancer (BC) among the Chinese Han female
      population.Around 124 patients with early stage BC were included in this
      retrospective study. All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients with
      proven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B).
      In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5 hours prior
      to the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive
      value (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%,
      respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%,
      respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, and
      PPV between the 2 procedures (P < .05).The results of this study demonstrated
      that USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALND
      or SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.

TI  - Multiplatform plasma metabolic and lipid fingerprinting of breast cancer: A pilot
      control-case study in Colombian Hispanic women.
LID - e0190958
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease associated with metabolic
      reprogramming. The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from
      Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and
      lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint
      of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were
      combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and
      healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites
      were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid
      metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in
      metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts 
      in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could
      contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC 
      in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the
      up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of
      cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in
      breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic
      women, despite racial differences.

TI  - Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s
      disease prediction.
LID - e0192192
AB  - Wavelet Neural Networks are a combination of neural networks and wavelets and
      have been mostly used in the area of time-series prediction and control.
      Recently, Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop
      cancer prediction models. The present study proposes to use ensembles of
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks. The search for a high quality ensemble is
      directed by a fitness function that incorporates the accuracy of the classifiers 
      both independently and as part of the ensemble itself. The ensemble approach is
      tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets, one on Breast
      Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease, using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.
      Our experimental results show that, for the first dataset, the performance was
      similar to previous studies reported in literature. On the second dataset, the
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous 
      methods. The third dataset is relatively new and this study is the first to
      report benchmark results.

TI  - Evaluation of drug mechanism and efficacy of a novel anti-angiogenic agent,
      TTAC-0001, using multi-modality bioimaging in a mouse breast cancer orthotopic
      model.
LID - e0187063
AB  - Purpose: Targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) has
      potential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling
      regulator of VEGF/VEGFR pathways. We aimed to elucidate the drug mechanism and
      anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-0001, a novel, fully human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR
      monoclonal antibody, in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-modal
      bioimaging. Materials and methods: We used orthotopic xenograft tumor model in
      which human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected into the right mammary
      fat pad of Balb/c nude mice. We investigated its biodistribution using serial
      fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action
      using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was
      assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic
      analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with 
      anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four
      groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2
      group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group). Results: The TTAC-10 group showed
      good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good
      anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive 
      cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10
      group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as
      detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also
      showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index 
      in histopathologic analyses. Conclusion: We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001
      effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic
      breast cancer model. It may provide a future treatment option for breast cancer.

TI  - Menstrual and reproductive factors and risk of breast cancer: A case-control
      study in the Fez region, Morocco.
LID - e0191333
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. In the
      Moroccan context, the role of well-known reproductive factors in breast cancer
      remains poorly documented. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship 
      between menstrual and reproductive factors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan
      women in the Fez region. Methods: A case–control study was conducted at the
      Hassan II University Hospital of Fez between January 2014 and April 2015. A total
      of 237 cases of breast cancer and 237 age-matched controls were included.
      Information on sociodemographic characteristics, menstrual and reproductive
      history, family history of breast cancer, and lifestyle factors was obtained
      through a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were
      used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer by
      menstrual and reproductive factors adjusted for potential confounders. Results:
      Early menarche (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.38) and nulliparity (OR = 3.77, 95% CI:
      1.98–7.30) were significantly related to an increased risk of breast cancer,
      whereas an early age at first full-term pregnancy was associated with a decreased
      risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.65). Conclusion: The results of 
      this study confirm the role of established reproductive factors for breast cancer
      in Moroccan women. It identified some susceptible groups at high risk of breast
      cancer. Preventive interventions and screening should focus on these groups as a 
      priority. These results should be confirmed in a larger, multicenter study.

TI  - High nuclear MSK1 is associated with longer survival in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 509-17
AB  - Purpose: Mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSKs) are important substrates of
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase family. MSK1
      and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases, with MSK1 being
      suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation, cell
      cycle progression, cell migration, invasion and tumour growth. The aim of the
      current study was to assess MSK1 protein expression in breast cancer tumour
      specimens, evaluating its prognostic significance. Methods: A large cohort of
      1902 early stage invasive breast cancer patients was used to explore the
      expression of MSK1. Protein expression was examined using standard
      immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Results: Low MSK1 protein expression 
      was associated with younger age (P = 0.004), higher tumour grade (P < 0.001),
      higher Nottingham Prognostic Index scores (P = 0.007), negative ER (P < 0.001)
      and PR (P < 0.001) status, and with triple-negative (P < 0.001) and basal-like
      (P < 0.001) phenotypes. Low MSK1 protein expression was significantly associated 
      with shorter time to distant metastasis (P < 0.001), and recurrence (P = 0.013)
      and early death due to breast cancer (P = 0.01). This association between high
      MSK1 expression and improved breast cancer-specific survival was observed in the 
      whole cohort (P = 0.009) and in the HER2-negative and non-basal like tumours
      (P = 0.006 and P = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis including other
      prognostic variables indicated that MSK1 is not an independent marker of outcome.
      Conclusions: High MSK1 is associated with improved breast cancer-specific
      survival in early stage invasive breast cancer patients, and has additional
      prognostic value in HER2-negative and non-basal like disease. Although not an
      independent marker of outcome, we believe such findings and significant
      associations with well-established negative prognostic factors (age, grade,
      Nottingham Prognostic Index, hormone receptor status, time to distant metastasis,
      recurrence and triple-negative/basal-like status) warrant further examination and
      validation in independent patient cohorts.

TI  - Differential microRNA expression in breast cancer with different onset age.
LID - e0191195
AB  - Purpose: The lower breast cancer incidence in Asian populations compared with
      Western populations has been speculated to be caused by environmental and genetic
      variation. Early-onset breast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast
      cancers in Asian populations, but the reason for this is unclear. We aimed to
      examine miRNA expression profiles in different age-onset groups and pathological 
      subtypes in Asian breast cancer. Methods: At the first stage, 10 samples (tumor: 
      n = 6, normal tissue: n = 4) were analyzed with an Agilent microRNA 470 probe
      microarray. Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that were significantly
      altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review were
      further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 145 breast cancer
      samples at the second stage of the process. Correlations between
      clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients from different age
      groups and candidate miRNA expression were elucidated. Results: In the present
      study, the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group, and an 
      onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates. For all
      breast cancer patients, miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated, and miR-21,
      miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-141 were up-regulated. In very young patients (age < 
      35 y/o), the expression of 3 and 8 specific miRNAs were up- and down-regulated,
      respectively. In young patients (36–40 y/o), 3 and 3 specific miRNAs were up- and
      down-regulated, respectively. miR-532-5p was up-regulated in triple-negative
      breast cancer. Conclusions: Differential miRNA expressions between normal and
      tumor tissues were observed in different age groups and tumor subtypes.
      Evolutionarily conserved miRNA clusters, which initiate malignancy
      transformation, were up-regulated in the breast cancers of very young patients.
      None of the significantly altered miRNAs were observed in postmenopausal
      patients.

TI  - Long term effects of manual lymphatic drainage and active exercises on physical
      morbidities, lymphoscintigraphy parameters and lymphedema formation in patients
      operated due to breast cancer: A clinical trial.
LID - e0189176
AB  - Purpose: evaluate whether manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) or active exercise (AE)
      is associated with shoulder range of motion (ROM), wound complication and changes
      in the lymphatic parameters after breast cancer (BC) surgery and whether these
      parameters have an association with lymphedema formation in the long run.
      Methods: Clinical trial with 106 women undergoing radical BC surgery, in the
      Women’s Integrated Healthcare Center—University of Campinas. Women were matched
      for staging, age and body mass index and were allocated to performed AE or MLD, 2
      weekly sessions during one month after surgery. The wound was evaluated 2 months 
      after surgery. ROM, upper limb circumference measurement and upper limb
      lymphoscintigraphy were performed before surgery, and 2 and 30 months after
      surgery. Results: The incidence of seroma, dehiscence and infection did not
      differ between groups. Both groups showed ROM deficit of flexion and abduction in
      the second month postoperative and partial recovery after 30 months. Cumulative
      incidence of lymphedema was 23.8% and did not differ between groups (p = 0.29).
      Concerning the lymphoscintigraphy parameters, there was a significant convergent 
      trend between baseline degree uptake (p = 0.003) and velocity visualization of
      axillary lymph nodes (p = 0.001) with lymphedema formation. A reduced marker
      uptake before or after surgery predicted lymphedema formation in the long run (>2
      years). None of the lymphoscintigraphy parameters were shown to be associated
      with the study group. Age ≤39 years was the factor with the greatest association 
      with lymphedema (p = 0.009). In women with age ≤39 years, BMI >24Kg/m2 was
      significantly associated with lymphedema (p = 0.017). In women over 39 years old,
      women treated with MLD were at a significantly higher risk of developing
      lymphedema (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Lymphatic abnormalities precede lymphedema
      formation in BC patients. In younger women, obesity seems to be the major player 
      in lymphedema development and, in older women, improving muscle strength through 
      AE can prevent lymphedema. In essence, MLD is as safe and effective as AE in
      rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery.

TI  - The use of automated Ki67 analysis to predict Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence
      categories in early-stage breast cancer.
LID - e0188983
AB  - Ki67 is a commonly used marker of cancer cell proliferation, and has significant 
      prognostic value in breast cancer. In spite of its clinical importance,
      assessment of Ki67 remains a challenge, as current manual scoring methods have
      high inter- and intra-user variability. A major reason for this variability is
      selection bias, in that different observers will score different regions of the
      same tumor. Here, we developed an automated Ki67 scoring method that eliminates
      selection bias, by using whole-slide analysis to identify and score the tumor
      regions with the highest proliferative rates. The Ki67 indices calculated using
      this method were highly concordant with manual scoring by a pathologist
      (Pearson’s r = 0.909) and between users (Pearson’s r = 0.984). We assessed the
      clinical validity of this method by scoring Ki67 from 328 whole-slide sections of
      resected early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-negative breast cancer. All patients had Oncotype DX testing performed
      (Genomic Health) and available Recurrence Scores. High Ki67 indices correlated
      significantly with several clinico-pathological correlates, including higher
      tumor grade (1 versus 3, P<0.001), higher mitotic score (1 versus 3, P<0.001),
      and lower Allred scores for estrogen and progesterone receptors (P = 0.002,
      0.008). High Ki67 indices were also significantly correlated with higher Oncotype
      DX risk-of-recurrence group (low versus high, P<0.001). Ki67 index was the major 
      contributor to a machine learning model which, when trained solely on
      clinico-pathological data and Ki67 scores, identified Oncotype DX high- and
      low-risk patients with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity and 80% specificity.
      Automated scoring of Ki67 can thus successfully address issues of consistency,
      reproducibility and accuracy, in a manner that integrates readily into the
      workflow of a pathology laboratory. Furthermore, automated Ki67 scores contribute
      significantly to models that predict risk of recurrence in breast cancer.

TI  - Breast cancer: The translation of big genomic data to cancer precision medicine.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of
      genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to cancer
      and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. For the
      past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from
      single‐gene to whole‐genome screening by using genome‐wide association study and 
      next‐generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International
      collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify
      clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings.
      Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of
      genomic alterations with high‐throughput screening as well as the use of genomic 
      information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which
      further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and
      monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing 
      data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine
      learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative “−omics” data to
      refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future.

TI  - Oestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in older
      women—Biological characteristics and long-term clinical outcome.
LID - e0188528
AB  - Background: Older women are at the greatest risk of breast cancer development and
      a considerable number present with comorbidities. Although the majority of breast
      cancers in this age group express oestrogen receptor (ER), which makes endocrine 
      therapy (primary or adjuvant) feasible, given the huge size of the elderly
      population, there remains a significant number of patients, in absolute term,
      whose tumours do not express ER and their management is challenging. Methods: Of 
      a consecutive series of 1,758 older (≥70 years) women with early operable primary
      breast cancer managed in a dedicated service from 1973–2010, 252(14.3%) had
      ER-negative (histochemical (H) score ≤50) tumours. Their clinical outcome was
      retrospectively reviewed and tumour samples collected from diagnostic core
      biopsies were analysed for progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki67 using
      immunohistochemistry. Results: The commonest primary treatment was surgery (N =
      194, 77%) followed by primary endocrine therapy (14.3%), primary radiotherapy
      (5.6%) and supportive treatment only (3.1%). Among the patients undergoing
      surgery, most of them had grade 3 (78.1%) and node-negative disease (62.2%). Some
      of them (21.1%) received postoperative radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of
      37.5 months, 117 patients had died, out of which 48.6% were due to breast cancer.
      For those who underwent surgery, the regional and local recurrence rates were 2% 
      and 1.1% per annum respectively. For those who received primary endocrine
      therapy, 38% progressed at 6 months, however all patients who had primary
      radiotherapy achieved clinical benefit at 6 months. Regardless of treatment
      given, the 5-year breast cancer specific and overall survival rates were 70% and 
      50% respectively. Biological analysis based on good quality needle core biopsy
      specimensfrom181 patients showed that 26.8% (N = 49), 16.9% (N = 31) and 70.7% (N
      = 70)expressed positivity for PgR, HER2 and Ki67 respectively. No correlation
      between these biomarkers and breast cancer specific survival was demonstrated.
      Conclusion: Oestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in
      older women is associated with poor prognostic features in terms of biology and
      clinical outcome. Surgery appears to produce the best outcome as a primary
      treatment, however for those where neither surgery nor chemotherapy is
      appropriate, primary radiotherapy can be beneficial.

TI  - Incidence of inflammatory breast cancer in patients with clinical inflammatory
      breast symptoms.
LID - e0189385
AB  - Background: To describe a large cohort of women with non-puerperal inflammatory
      breast and to identify characteristics of inflammatory breast cancer. Methods:
      All patients consulting for inflammatory breast syndrome in the breast unit of
      our tertiary University hospital between September 2013 and December 2015 were
      prospectively included. We excluded women who were pregnant or in the postpartum 
      period. Patients underwent systematic clinical examination and imaging (breast
      ultrasonography and mammography). A biopsy was performed if the clinician
      suspected a malignant lesion of the breast. Clinicopathologic and radiologic data
      were registered. Statistics were performed using R (3.0.2 version) software.
      Results: Among the 76 patients screened and included, 38 (50%) had a malignant
      lesion at final diagnosis, 21 (27.6%) were diagnosed with infectious disease and 
      17 (22.4%) with inflammatory disease of the breast. When compared to patients
      with benign disease, patients with a malignant lesion were significantly older (p
      = 0.022, CI95% 1.78–14.7), had a significantly bigger palpable mass (p<0.001, CI 
      95% 22.8–58.9), were more likely to have skin thickening (p = 0.05) and had more 
      suspicious lymph nodes at clinical examination (p<0.001, CI 95% 2.72–65.3).
      Precise limits on ultrasonography were significantly associated with benign
      lesions. The presence of a mass (p = 0.04), micro calcifications (p = 0.04) or of
      focal asymmetry (p<0.001, CI95% 1.3–618) on mammography was significantly
      associated with malignant disease. Conclusion: Inflammatory breast cancer was
      common in our cohort of women consulting for inflammatory breast syndrome.
      Identifying these patients with high-risk malignancy is crucial in the management
      of an inflammatory breast.

TI  - Combination of palbociclib with enzalutamide shows in vitro activity in RB
      proficient and androgen receptor positive triple negative breast cancer cells.
LID - e0189007
AB  - Objectives: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks specific drug targets and 
      remains challenging. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6)
      inhibitor is approved for metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human
      epithermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The nature of cell
      cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in TNBC cells.
      Retinoblastoma (RB, a known substrate of CDK4/6) pathway deregulation is a
      frequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6
      inhibition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in
      RB-proficient TNBC models. In addition, recent studies reported that
      anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical efficacy in androgen-receptor
      (AR)-positive TNBC cells. Here we examined the effect of palbociclib in
      combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells. Method: MDA-MB-453,
      BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies.
      Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis. Cytostatic effect was
      examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. 
      Results: Palbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells, and
      enzalutamide inhibited cell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells. Enzalutamide
      treatment could enhance the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in
      AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells. In addition, palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest
      in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown.
      Conclusion: Our study provided a preclinical rationale in selecting patients who 
      might have therapeutic benefit from combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with AR
      antagonists.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes of surgeon-performed intraoperative ultrasonography-guided
      wire localization and preoperative wire localization in nonpalpable breast cancer
      patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery: A retrospective cohort study.
LID - e9340
AB  - This study aimed to determine the efficacy of intraoperative
      ultrasonography-guided wire localization guided breast-conserving surgery (BCS)
      for nonpalpable breast cancer and compare it to conventional preoperative wire
      localization (PWL) guided surgery.We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts 
      of 214 consecutive nonpalpable breast cancer patients who underwent BCS using
      intraoperative ultrasonography-guided wire localization by a surgeon (IUWLS) and 
      PWL, between April 2013 and March 2017. Positive surgical margins, reexcision
      rates, and resection volumes were investigated.Of the total cohort, 124 patients 
      underwent BCS with IUWLS and 90 patients with PWL. The following did not differ
      between the IUWLS and PWL groups: positive margin status, re-excision rate,
      conversion rate, permanent positive margin status, reoperation rate, median
      optimal resection volume (ORV), median total resection volume (TRV), and median
      closest tumor-free margin. Rather, median (range) widest tumor-free margin was
      significantly smaller in the IUWLS group (9 mm [5–12]) than in the PWL group
      (14 mm [9–20]; P = .003]). Median (range) calculated resection ratio (CRR) was
      significantly lower in the IUWLS group (1.67 [0.87–9.38]) than in the PWL group
      (4.83 [1.63–21.04]; P = .02).In nonpalpable breast cancer patients undergoing
      BCS, IUWLS showed positive resection margins and reexcision rates equivalent to
      those of the conventional PWL method. Additionally, excision volume and widest
      tumor-free margin were smaller with IUWLS, confirming that healthy breast tissue 
      is less likely to be resected with this method. Our results suggest that IUWLS
      offers an excellent alternative to PWL, while avoiding PWL-induced patient
      discomfort.

TI  - Prognostic utility of FDG PET/CT and bone scintigraphy in breast cancer patients 
      with bone-only metastasis.
LID - e8985
AB  - We performed this retrospective clinical study to examine the prognostic power of
      bone scintigraphy (BS) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in terms of overall survival (OS) of 
      breast cancer with bone-only metastasis.We retrospectively evaluated 100 female
      invasive ductal breast cancer patients (mean age 48.1 years) with bone-only
      metastasis. Twenty-five patients had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive tumors, 65 were estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone
      receptor (PR)-positive, HER2-negative tumors, and 10 were triple negative tumors.
      The patients were treated properly with various treatments, including
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone, and bisphosphonate therapy, based on their
      clinical status. All patients underwent BS and FDG PET/CT at baseline and 1 year 
      after treatment. The baseline and follow images were visually compared, and the
      patients were grouped as responders or nonresponders based on their images. OS
      was compared between the groups.The mean OS after the diagnosis of bone-only
      metastasis was 57.6 months. Fifty-one patients (51%) died within 5 years after
      diagnosis of metastasis. No difference in survival was evident between responders
      and nonresponders based on BS imaging data (P = .090). The response status based 
      on PET imaging data waste only significant independent prognostic factor on
      multivariate analysis (P = .001). Survival was lower in nonresponders than in
      responders based on PET imaging (32.7% vs 66.4%; P < .001).Our findings suggest
      that the response status according to FDG PET imaging can be used to predict OS
      in breast cancer patients with bone-only metastasis.

TI  - Neuroligin 4X overexpression in human breast cancer is associated with poor
      relapse-free survival.
LID - e0189662
AB  - The molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis
      still remain unclear to date. It is a heterogeneous disease featuring several
      different phenotypes with consistently different biological characteristics.
      Neuroligins are neural cell adhesion molecules that have been implicated in
      heterotopic cell adhesion. In humans, alterations in neuroligin genes are
      implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases. Until recently, neuroligins
      have been shown to be abundantly expressed in blood vessels and also play a role 
      implicated in the growth of glioma cells. Here we report increased expression of 
      neuroligin 4X (NLGN4X) in breast cancer. We found NLGN4X was abundantly expressed
      in breast cancer tissues. NLGN4X expression data for all breast cancer cell lines
      in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) was analyzed. Correlation between
      NLGN4X levels and clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed within Oncomine
      datasets. Evaluation of these bioinfomatic datasets results revealed that NLGN4X 
      expression was higher in triple negative breast cancer cells, particularly the
      basal subtype and tissues versus non-triple-negative sets. Its level was also
      observed to be higher in metastatic tissues. RT-PCR, flow cytometry and
      immunofluorescence study of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells validated
      that NLGN4X was increased in MDA-MB-231. Knockdown of NLGN4X expression by siRNA 
      decreased cell proliferation and migration significantly in MDA-MB-231 breast
      cancer cells. NLGN4X knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in induction of
      apoptosis as determined by annexin staining, elevated caspase 3/7 and cleaved
      PARP by flow cytometry. High NLGN4X expression highly correlated with decrease in
      relapse free-survival in TNBC. NLGN4X might represent novel biomarkers and
      therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Inhibition of NLGN4X may be a new target
      for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

      LymphadenopathyMedication: —Clinical Procedure: —Specialty: OncologyObjective::
      Rare co-existance of disease or pathology Background:: Dermatopathic
      lymphadenitis is a rare benign lymphatic hyperplasia commonly associated with
      exfoliative or eczematoid dermatitis. Of interest, this condition can be confused
      with lymphatic metastasis in adults. Case Report:: In this report, we describe
      the case of a 56-year-old woman diagnosed with left breast invasive ductal
      carcinoma in remission, who presented with dermatopathic lymphadenitis mimicking 
      breast cancer recurrence. Conclusions:: Dermatopathic lymphadenitis is a benign
      entity that needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of
      lymphadenopathy. Pursuing extensive workup in asymptomatic patients with a
      similar presentation and initial negative tests for malignancy recurrence is not 
      recommended.

      with breast cancer: A case report.
LID - e9004
AB  - Rationale:: Anthracyclines cardiotoxicity characterized by dilated myocardiopathy
      has been well described in the literature. However, anthracyclines-induced
      valvular diseases have been seldom reported. Patient concerns:: In this study, we
      present the case of a 62-year-old Chinese female patient with breast cancer
      developing severe mitral regurgitation after anthracycline exposure. Diagnoses:: 
      The patient was diagnosed with mitral regurgitation with preserved left
      ventricular ejection fraction and normal cardiac chamber dimensions in the sixth 
      month after the last course of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. However,
      continued decrease in LVEF with normal left ventricular wall thickness, and
      serial increases in left atrial and ventricular dimensions were observed in the
      follow-up echocardiography. Interventions:: Treatments with oral itraconazole at 
      a dose of 75 mg/day and local wound care with ciclopirox olamine ointment were
      administered. Outcomes:: The patient responded well to the treatment with
      perindopril, metoprolol succinate, spirolactone, and furosemide, and symptoms
      associated with heart failure were dramatically relieved. Lessons:: The incipient
      mitral regurgitation may serve as an early sign of myocardial dysfunction that
      can facilitate a timely recognition of cardiotoxicity, which is crucial to a
      timely change of chemotherapy regimen and an appropriate initiation of
      antiremodeling therapy that could limit anthracycline cardiotoxicity and improve 
      overall outcome.

TI  - Association between serum cytokines and progression of breast cancer in Chinese
      population.
LID - e8840
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6),
      IL-8, IL-10, squamous cell cancer antigen (SCC-Ag), and cytokeratin 21-1 fragment
      (CYFRA 21-1) in the metastasis and prognosis of breast cancer.A total of 534
      breast cancer patients admitted to our department between January 2011 and
      December 2014 were enrolled in this study. Besides, 452 matched healthy
      individuals received physical examination at the same period served as the normal
      control. Serum IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were
      determined using an immunoradiometric assay. SCC-Ag level was evaluated using
      chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. CYFRA 21-1 was determined using the
      chemiluminescence assay.Compared with the control group, a significant increase
      was noticed in the serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in breast cancer patients,
      especially those with severe conditions (P < .01). Serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10
      showed a significant increase in the patients with severe breast cancer compared 
      with those with mild conditions (P < .05). For the patients with response after
      radiotherapy, the serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were significantly decreased
      compared with the baseline levels (P < .05). The median survival duration for the
      patients of SCC-Ag negative patients was 25 months, while that for the SCC-Ag
      positive group was 16 months. Significant difference was noticed in the survival 
      of SCC-Ag negative group compared with that of SCC-Ag positive group
      (P < .05).Serum IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, SCC-Ag, and CYFRA 21-1 were considered as
      potential markers in the metastasis and prognosis of breast cancer.

TI  - The prognostic impact of the platelet distribution width-to-platelet count ratio 
      in patients with breast cancer.
LID - e0189166
AB  - Activated platelets promote tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and invasion.
      Platelet activity can be inferred by platelet volume indices (PVIs), which
      include platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet
      distribution width-to-platelet count ratio (PDW/P), and mean platelet
      volume-to-platelet count ratio. Platelets and platelet-related markers, such as
      the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, have been found to be significant prognostic
      factors in patients with breast cancer. However, the role of PVIs for predicting 
      survival in breast cancer remains unknown; hence, we performed this retrospective
      analysis of 275 patients with breast cancer. PVIs were compared with
      clinicopathological variables, and were assessed to identify independent
      indicators associated with disease-free survival (DFS) using the Cox proportional
      hazards model. An elevated PDW/P significantly correlated with age and HER2
      status. Univariate analysis revealed that elevated PDW, MPV, and PDW/P as well as
      tumor size, nuclear grade, and lymph node involvement were significantly
      associated with inferior DFS rates (tumor size: p<0.01; nuclear grade, lymph node
      involvement, PDW, MPV, and PDW/P: p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, a large
      tumor size and elevated PDW/P were significant prognostic factors for DFS, with
      hazard ratios of 3.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–8.47) and 2.99 (95% CI:
      1.18–7.57), respectively (p<0.05). Our study is the first to reveal that an
      elevated PDW/P significantly reduces DFS in patients with breast carcinoma.
      Measuring the PDW/P is simple, relatively inexpensive, and almost universally
      available using routine blood counts; this makes it an attractive biomarker for
      improved risk assessment.

TI  - The prognostic role of tumor size in early breast cancer in the era of molecular 
      biology.
LID - e0189127
AB  - Background: The prognosis of early breast cancer (EBC) depends on patient and
      tumor characteristics. The association between tumor size, the largest diameter
      in TNM staging, and prognosis is well recognized. According to TNM, tumors
      classified as T2, could have very different volumes; e.g. a tumor of 2.1 cm has a
      volume of 4500 mm3, while a tumor of 4.9 cm has a volume of 60.000 mm3 even
      belonging to the same class. The aim of the study is to establish if the
      prognostic role of tumor size, expressed as diameter and volume, has been
      overshadowed by other factors. Methods: The primary objective is to evaluate the 
      association between tumor dimensions and overall survival (OS) / disease free
      survival (DFS), in our institution from January 1st 2005 to September 30th 2013
      in a surgical T1-T2 population. Volume was evaluated with the measurement of
      three half-diameters of the tumor (a, b and c), and calculated using the
      following formula: 4/3π x a x b x c. Results: 341 patients with T1-T2 EBC were
      included. 86.5% were treated with conservative surgery. 85.1% had a Luminal
      subtype, 9.1% were Triple negative and 7.4% were HER2 positive. Median volume was
      942 mm3 (range 0.52–31.651.2). 44 patients (12.9%) relapsed and 23 patients died.
      With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the univariate analysis for DFS showed an
      association between age, tumor size, volume, histological grading and molecular
      subtype. The multivariate analysis confirmed the statistically significant
      association only for molecular subtype (p 0.005), with a worse prognosis for
      Triple negative and HER2 positive subtypes compared with Luminal (HR: 2.65;
      95%CI: 1.34–5.22). Likewise for OS, an association was shown by the multivariate 
      analysis solely for molecular subtype (HER2 and Triple negative vs. Luminal. HR: 
      2.83; 95% CI:1.46–5.49; p 0.002). Conclusions: In our study, the only parameter
      that strongly influences survival is molecular subtype. These findings encourage 
      clinicians to choose adjuvant treatment not based on dimensional criteria but on 
      biological features.

TI  - The utility of anti-Müllerian hormone in the diagnosis and prediction of loss of 
      ovarian function following chemotherapy for early breast cancer.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - Aim: Chemotherapy results in permanent loss of ovarian function in some
      premenopausal women. Accurate identification in women with hormone-sensitive
      early breast cancer (eBC) would allow optimisation of subsequent endocrine
      treatment. We sought to assess whether analysis of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)
      using a sensitive automated assay could identify women who would not regain
      ovarian function after chemotherapy. Methods: Data from women in the Ovarian
      Protection Trial in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients (OPTION) trial of
      goserelin (a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue) for ovarian
      protection were analysed. Women were assessed for premature ovarian insufficiency
      (POI: amenorrhoea with elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) at 24 months 
      after diagnosis. The accuracy of AMH for the diagnosis of POI and its prediction 
      from measurement at the end of chemotherapy was calculated. Results: AMH below
      the level of detection showed good diagnostic accuracy for POI at 24 months
      (n = 73) with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve of
      0.86, sensitivity 1.0 and specificity 0.73 at the assay limit of detection. In
      women aged >40 at diagnosis who did not receive goserelin, AMH measured at end of
      chemotherapy also gave good prediction of POI at 24 months (area under the curve 
      (AUC) 0.89 95% CI 0.75–1.0, n = 32), with sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.82,
      diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 42.8. FSH gave slightly lower AUC, and specificity
      was low at 0.55. Age but not tamoxifen impacted on AMH levels. Conclusion: Using 
      this sensitive AMH assay, the finding of an undetectable AMH level in women aged 
      >40 at the end of chemotherapy for eBC gave a good prediction that ovarian
      function would not return. This may allow alterations in post-chemotherapy
      endocrine management.

TI  - Male breast cancer and mantle cell lymphoma in a single patient: A case report
      and literature review.
LID - e8911
AB  - Rationale:: Although still relatively rare, multiple primary malignant neoplasms 
      (MPMNs) have been increasingly reported in recent years. Patient concerns and
      diagnoses:: A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for a painless,
      incidental left axillary lump. Ultrasound showed enlarged left axillary lymph
      nodes. An excisional biopsy was conducted on 3 lymph nodes. The pathological
      diagnosis was determined to be metastatic adenocarcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma
      (MCL) in the lymph nodes. Further physical examination of the patient yielded a
      1.5-cm hard, left subareolar mass. Interventions and outcomes:: The patient
      underwent modified radical mastectomy. The diagnosis was grade II invasive ductal
      carcinoma (stage IIA). The axillary lymph node showed MCL (stage I, group A), but
      not metastatic ductal carcinoma. The patient received chemotherapy, including 6
      courses of CHOP (A chemotherapy protocol consists of cyclophosphamide 1.2 g day
      1, doxorubicin 80 mg day 1, vindesine 4 mg day1, and prednisone 90 mg from day 1 
      to 5) for lymphoma and breast cancer. The patient was also administered endocrine
      therapy. After a 54-month follow-up, the patient was well with no evidence of
      disease. Lessons:: MPMNs are easily misdiagnosed as a primary and metastatic
      tumor, leading to delayed or erroneous treatment. Male breast cancer in a patient
      with MCL is rare. Early diagnosis and proper therapy are necessary for an optimal
      prognosis. Further studies are required to define the mechanisms and risk factors
      of MPMNs.

TI  - Cytotoxic effect of albumin coated copper nanoparticle on human breast cancer
      cells of MDA-MB 231.
LID - e0188639
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to design a new nanocomposite that would have 
      high cytotoxicity against invasive breast cancer cells and minimum side effects
      on normal cells. Methods: An albumin nano-carrier for delivery of CuNPs was
      developed. The ACuNPs formation was characterized by TEM, DLS and UV-Vis,
      fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The cytotoxic efficacy of the
      ACuNPs against human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231) and normal cells (MCF-10A) 
      was compared using a standard MTT assay. The mechanism of cell death induced by
      ACuNPs was considered by inverted and fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry and 
      gel electrophoresis. The effects of compounds on ROS generations in MDA-MB 231
      cells were also studied. Results: It was found that the resulted ACuNPs with a
      diameter of 62.7 nm and zeta potential of about -10.76 mV, are suitable for
      extravasation into tumor cells. In ACuNPs, the 90% of the secondary structure and
      almost all the tertiary structure of albumin remained intact. Comparing to CuNPs,
      ACuNPs could significantly suppress the viability of cancer cells while they were
      less toxic on normal cells. Compared with the untreated cells, the MDA-MB 231
      cell line showed higher levels of ROS production after treatment with ACuNPs. The
      increase in ROS production after 24 hours indicated that ACuNPs induce apoptosis.
      Conclusions: The ACuNPs characteristics such as intact structure of albumin, high
      toxicity against cancer cells comparing to normal cells and apoptosis induction
      as the mechanism of cell death, revealed that this nanocomposite is a good
      candidate to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer
      cells.

LID - e8718
AB  - Rationale:: Breast cancer, the most common form of cancer among women, rarely
      metastases to the head and neck region. To date, there have been only 6 similar
      cases in the literature, and most patients in these reports had very poor
      prognosis. Patients concerns:: We report a 61-year-old female presented pain and 
      numbness on the right side of the face 5 years after being diagnosed with
      triple-negative breast cancer. Diagnosis:: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      revealed a tissue mass in the sphenoid sinus. The tissue biopsy confirmed
      metastasis of breast cancer. Intervention:: The patient received initial
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy plus 10 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy
      Outcomes:: The patient got long-term progression-free survival time. The total
      time to progression was 32 months. Lessons:: Although breast cancer rarely
      metastasizes to the head and neck region, awareness should be raised when breast 
      cancer patients experience headache or have sinus-related symptoms. Chemotherapy 
      and radiotherapy may be effective to treat paranasal sinus metastasis of
      triple-negative breast cancer, and patients may achieve long-term survival.

TI  - Correlation study between osteoporosis and hematopoiesis in the context of
      adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.
PG  - 309-17
AB  - This retrospective study attempts to establish if a correlation exists between
      osteoporosis and hematopoiesis before and after adjuvant chemotherapy in the
      context of non-metastatic breast cancer. Osteoporosis is interpreted both as a
      direct marker of osteoblastic decline and as an indirect marker of increased bone
      marrow adiposity within the hematopoietic microenvironment. Patients from the
      “Centre du Sein” at CHUV (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois) undergoing
      adjuvant chemotherapy were included in this study. Evolution of blood counts was 
      studied in correlation with the osteoporosis status. Toxicity of chemotherapy was
      coded according to published probability of febrile neutropenia. One hundred
      forty-three women were included: mean age 52.1 ± 12.5 years, mean BMI (body mass 
      index) 24.4 ± 4.1. BMD (bone mineral density) scored osteoporotic in 32% and
      osteopenic in 45%. Prior to chemotherapy, BMD was positively correlated with
      neutrophil (p < 0.001) and thrombocyte (p = 0.01) count; TBS (trabecular bone
      score) was not correlated with blood count. After the first cycle of
      chemotherapy, an increase of one point in TBS correlated with a decrease of 57%
      on the time to reach leucocyte nadir (p = 0.004). There was a positive
      correlation between BMD and risk of infection (p < 0.001). Our data demonstrates 
      an association between osteoporosis and lower blood counts in a younger cohort
      than previously published, extending it for the first time to neutrophil counts
      in females. Our results suggest that the healthier the bone, the earlier the
      lowest leucocyte count value, prompting further research on this area.

TI  - Subtypes of breast cancer show different spatial distributions of brain
      metastases.
LID - e0188542
AB  - The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of 
      breast cancer brain metastases (BM) differ according to their biological
      subtypes. MR images of 100 patients with BM from primary breast cancer were
      retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided according to the biological
      subtype of the primary tumor, (triple-negative: 24, HER2 positive: 48, luminal:
      28). All images marked with BMs were standardized to the human brain MRI atlas
      provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 database. Distribution
      pattern of BM was evaluated with intra-group and intergroup analysis. In
      intra-group analysis, hot spots of metastases from triple-negative are evenly
      distributed in the brain, meanwhile BMs from HER2 positive and luminal type occur
      dominantly in occipital lobe and cerebellum. In intergroup analysis, BMs from
      triple-negative type occurred more often in frontal lobe, limbic region, and
      parietal lobe, compared with other types (P < .05). Breast cancer subtypes tend
      to demonstrate different spatial distributions of their BMs. These findings may
      have direct implications for dose modulation in prophylactic irradiation as well 
      as for differential diagnoses. Thus, this result should be validated in future
      study with a larger population.

TI  - Prognostic significance of metabolic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 in breast cancer: 
      A meta-analysis.
LID - e8690
AB  - Backgrounds:: Numerous studies have reported that aberrant pyruvate kinase M2
      isoform (PKM2) expressed in cancer, indicating that PKM2 plays a critical role in
      tumor initiation and progression. Nevertheless, its prognostic value in breast
      cancer tumor is yet contentious. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to
      evaluate the prognostic significance of PKM2 in breast cancer. Methods:: Eligible
      relevant literatures were retrieved by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library,
      Embase through December 2016. Articles that comparing different PKM2 expression
      levels in human breast cancer tissues and prognostic significance were included. 
      Software RevMan 5.3 and STATA (Review Manager (RevMan): [Computer program].
      Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 
      2014. STATA: StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College
      Station, TX: StataCorp LP) were applied to analyze the outcomes. Pooled results
      were presented in hazardous ratios (HRs) of 5-year overall survival (OS),
      progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratios (ORs) of clinicopathological
      features with 95% confidence intervals. Results:: Data from 6 involved studies
      with 895 patients were summarized. Breast cancer patients with high PKM2 had a
      worse OS (pooled HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.31–2.08, P < .001) and PFS (pooled
      HR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.84–3.36, P < .00001). High PKM2 expression is related to
      lymph node metastasis (N1+N2+N3 vs N0, OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.39–2.80, P = .0001). 
      The outcome stability was verified via sensitivity analysis. But elevated PKM2
      expression was not correlated to tumor stage (T2+T3 vs T1, pooled OR = 0.80, 95% 
      CI = 0.36–1.77, P = .58) and differential grade (G2+G3 vs G1, OR = 2.74,
      95%CI = 0.76–9.84, P = .12). No publication bias was found in the included
      studies for OS (Begg test, P = .260; Egger test, P = .747). Conclusions:: High
      PKM2 expression denotes worse OS and PFS in breast cancer patients, and correlate
      with the lymph node metastasis. However, there is no evidence for the impact of
      PKM2 expression on T stage and tumor differentiation.

TI  - CONSORT-Independent prognostic value of asphericity of pretherapeutic F-18 FDG
      uptake by primary tumors in patients with breast cancer.
LID - e8438
AB  - Background:: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic implication of 
      asphericity (ASP); spatial irregularity; of pretherapeutic 18F
      2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (18F FDG) tumor uptake in patients with invasive
      ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. Methods:: One hundred thirty-one female IDC
      patients (mean age = 48.1 ± 10.4 years), with pathological tumor size greater
      than 2 cm were retrospectively evaluated using 18F FDG positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). ASP of 18F FDG distribution was
      calculated on the basis of the deviation of the tumor shape from spherical
      symmetry. Progression-free survival (PFS) was predicted on the basis of the
      univariate and multivariate analyses of the measured clinicopathologic factors
      and metabolic PET parameters [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax),
      metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG)]. Results:: The
      PFS rate among the 131 patients was 90.1%. The mean follow-up time was 50 months 
      for the entire study cohort and 26 months for the patients with recurrent
      disease. It is evident from the univariate analysis that N stage, hormonal
      receptor (Estrogen, ER/Progesterone, PR) status, MTV (≤4.2 mL), and ASP (≤15.1%) 
      affected the PFS. Hazard ratios (HRs) estimated from the multivariate Cox
      regression analysis show that N stage (HR = 17.6), ASP (HR = 11.9), and hormonal 
      receptor status (HR = 6.9) were independent prognostic factors in predicting PFS.
      In the subgroup of patients with lymph node metastasis, ASP (HR = 10.9) and
      hormonal receptor status (HR = 9.1) were independent prognostic factors for PFS. 
      Conclusion:: ASP of 18F FDG uptake is an independent predictor of outcome in IDC 
      patients, and can be used for prognostic stratification.

TI  - A tissue microRNA signature that predicts the prognosis of breast cancer in young
      women.
LID - e0187638
AB  - Since breast cancers in young women are generally aggressive, young patients tend
      to be intensively treated with anti-cancer drugs. To optimize the strategy for
      treatment, particularly in young women, prognostic biomarkers are urgently
      required. The objective of this study was to identify a tissue microRNA (miRNA)
      signature that predicts prognosis in young breast cancer patients. Total RNA from
      45 breast cancer patients aged <35 years was extracted from formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and analyzed using miRNA microarrays. Patients
      were categorized into two groups according to recurrence status within the 5 year
      period after surgery: recurrence (n = 11) and non-recurrent (n = 34).
      Histological parameters of hormone receptors and Ki-67 were statistically
      compared between the two groups. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified,
      and their associations with overall survival (OS) were evaluated by log-rank
      test. The median observation period was 5.8 years for the recurrent group, and
      9.1 years for the non-recurrent group. Nine miRNAs were significantly
      differentially expressed between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Receiver
      Operating Characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the prediction 
      accuracy of the identified miRNAs, and the resultant area under the curve was
      >0.7. Five of the miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the expression levels of 
      three of those five (miR-183-5p, miR-194-5p, and miR-1285-5p), both alone and in 
      combination, were associated with OS. In conclusion, we identified three
      candidate miRNAs that could be used separately or in combination as prognostic
      biomarkers in young breast cancer patients. This miRNA signature may enable
      selection of better treatment choices for young women with this disease.

TI  - Morphological adaptations in breast cancer cells as a function of prolonged
      passaging on compliant substrates.
LID - e0187853
AB  - Standard tissue culture practices involve propagating cells on tissue culture
      polystyrene (TCP) dishes, which are flat, 2-dimensional (2D) and orders of
      magnitude stiffer than most tissues in the body. Such simplified conditions lead 
      to phenotypical cell changes and altered cell behaviors. Hence, much research has
      been focused on developing novel biomaterials and culture conditions that more
      closely emulate in vivo cell microenvironments. In particular, biomaterial
      stiffness has emerged as a key property that greatly affects cell behaviors such 
      as adhesion, morphology, proliferation and motility among others. Here we ask
      whether cells that have been conditioned to TCP, would still show significant
      dependence on substrate stiffness if they are first pre-adapted to a more
      physiologically relevant environment. We used two commonly utilized breast cancer
      cell lines, namely MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and examined the effect of prolonged
      cell culturing on polyacrylamide substrates of varying compliance. We followed
      changes in cell adhesion, proliferation, shape factor, spreading area and
      spreading rate. After pre-adaptation, we noted diminished differences in cell
      behaviors when comparing between soft (1 kPa) and stiff (103 kPa) gels as well as
      rigid TCP control. Prolonged culturing of cells on complaint substrates further
      influenced responses of pre-adapted cells when transferred back to TCP. Our
      results have implications for the study of stiffness-dependent cell behaviors and
      indicate that cell pre-adaptation to the substrate needs consideration.

      and taxanes were eligible. Patients with brain metastases and homozygous for
      UGT1A1 *6 or *28 or compound heterozygous (*6/*28) were excluded. A
      dose‐escalation design was chosen for the phase I portion (level 1: irinotecan
      80 mg/m2 days 1–8 and S‐1 80 mg/m2 days 1–14 every 3 weeks; level 2: irinotecan
      100 mg/m2 and S‐1 80 mg/m2). Study objectives included determination of the
      recommended dose for phase II, response rate, progression‐free survival (PFS),
      and safety. Pharmacokinetics and CD34+ circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as
      pharmacodynamics were also analyzed. Thirty‐seven patients were included. One
      patient at each level developed dose‐limiting toxicities; therefore, level 2 was 
      the recommended dose for phase II. Diarrhea was more common in patients
      possessing a *6 or *28 allele compared with wild‐type homozygous patients (46%
      and 25%). Among 29 patients treated at level 2, PFS was longer for UGT1A1 wt/*6
      and wt/*28 patients than for wt/wt patients (12 vs. 8 months, P = 0.06). PFS was 
      significantly longer in patients with a larger‐than‐median SN‐38 area under the
      curve (AUC) than in those with a smaller AUC (P = 0.039). There was an
      association between clinical benefit and reduction in baseline CD34+CECs by S‐1
      (P = 0.047). The combination of irinotecan and S‐1 is effective and warrants
      further investigation.

TI  - Volume-based metabolic parameter of breast cancer on preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT 
      could predict axillary lymph node metastasis.
LID - e8557
AB  - The purpose of our study was to evaluate the association between metabolic
      parameters on FDG PET/CT and axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in patients
      with invasive breast cancer.From January 2012 to December 2012, we analyzed 173
      patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) who underwent both initial breast
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) examinations. All metabolic
      parameters were measured from the tumor volume segmented by a gradient-based
      method. Once the primary target lesion was segmented, maximum standardized uptake
      value (SUVmax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume 
      (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated automatically by the
      MIMvista software.Mean age of 173 patients was 49 years. Of 173 patients, 45
      (26%) showed ALNM. On univariate analysis, larger tumor size (>2.2 cm; P = .002),
      presence of lymphovascular invasion (P < .001), higher SUVmax (>2.82; P = .038), 
      higher SUVmean (>1.2; P = .027), higher MTV (>2.38; P < .001), and higher TLG
      (>3.98; P = .007) were associated with a higher probability of ALNM. On
      multivariate analysis, presence of lymphovascular invasion (adjusted odds ratio
      [OR], 11.053; 95% CI, 4.403–27.751; P < .001) and higher MTV (>2.38) (adjusted
      OR, 2.696; 95% CI, 1.079–6.739; P = .034) maintained independent significance in 
      predicting ALNM. In subgroup analysis of T2/T3 breast cancer, lymphovascular
      invasion (adjusted OR, 20.976; 95% CI, 5.431–81.010; P < .001) and higher MTV
      (>2.38) (adjusted OR, 4.906; 95% CI, 1.616–14.896; P = .005) were independent
      predictors of ALNM. However in T1 breast cancer, lymphovascular invasion
      (adjusted OR, 16.096; 95% CI, 2.517–102.939; P = .003) and larger SUV mean (>1.2)
      (adjusted OR, 13.275; 95% CI, 1.233–142.908; P = .033) were independent
      predictors while MTV was not.MTV may be associated with ALNM in patients with
      invasive breast cancer, particularly T2 and T3 stages. In T1 breast cancer,
      SUVmean was associated with ALNM.

TI  - Clinicopathologic and prognostic features of breast cancer in young women: a
      series from North of Morocco.
LID - 106
AB  - Background: Literature data reported a higher frequency of breast cancer in young
      women (BCYW) in developing countries. BCYW is associated with delayed diagnosis, 
      aggressive biology and poor prognosis. However, our knowledge of biological
      profile, treatment received and outcome of young patients is still limited in
      Morocco. We propose to analyze clinicopathologic, therapeutic and prognostic
      features of BCYW among a series of patients native and/or inhabitant of North of 
      Morocco. Methods: We carried out a retro-prospective study of 331 infiltrating
      breast cancer cases registered between January 2010 and December 2015. Details of
      tumor pathology, treatment and outcome were collected. Disease-Free Survival
      (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: 
      A total of 82 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 or
      younger (24.8%). Median age was 36 years. More than one quarter (26%) of patients
      had family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Advanced stages accounted for
      34.2% of cases. Median tumor diameter was 2.8 cm. Intermediate and high-grade
      tumors represented 47.6% and 40.2%, respectively. Nodal involvement was present
      in 58.5% and lymphovascular invasion was found in 47.7% of the patients. About
      two thirds (66.2%) of tumors were hormone receptor positive, 29.2% over-expressed
      HER2 receptor and 23% were triple negative. Patients underwent breast conserving 
      surgery in 38.2% of cases, 61.7% were offered adjuvant chemotherapy and 84.6%
      received hormone therapy. Five-year DFS and OS were respectively 88.9% and 75.6%.
      Locoregional recurrence occurred in 2.8% of cases and 8.3% of patients developed 
      distant metastases. Conclusion: Our findings are in accordance with previous
      studies that have shown a higher frequency of breast cancer among Moroccan young 
      women. In line with literature data, clinicopathologic profile seems to be
      aggressive and prognosis is pejorative in our series.

TI  - Immunohistochemical staining of leptin is associated with grade, stage, lymph
      node involvement, recurrence, and hormone receptor phenotypes in breast cancer.
LID - 105
AB  - Background: Obesity is part of the established risk factors for breast cancer
      (BC) in postmenopausal females. Circulating leptin increases in parallel with the
      increase of body weight and fat reservoir. Methods: This research investigated
      the link between leptin phenotype and the clinicopathological factors in BC. A
      large set of breast cancer cases (449), and 27 non-cancerous tissue samples of
      breast were employed for leptin expression recognition using immunohistochemistry
      staining. Results: Cytoplasmic immunohistochemical staining of leptin was
      recognized in 376 (83.7%) and 25 (92.6%) of BC and control cases respectively.
      Leptin immunostaining were significantly associated with age, histotypes, grade, 
      stage, lymph node involvement, tumor recurrence, hormone receptor phenotypes, ER 
      and HER2 expressions, and p-values were (P = 0.0233), (P = 0.0001), (P = 0.050), 
      (P = 0.0291), (P = 0.0300), (P = 0.0023), (P = 0.0021), (P = 0.0279)
      respectively. Reasonable proportion of cases with low staining score was more
      prevalent in all subgroups of clinicopathological parameters except ER- PR+ HER2-
      hormone receptor phenotype and mucinous carcinoma which showed high level of
      leptin immunoreactivity. Tumor recurrence is less prevailing in high score leptin
      immunostaining cases. Furthermore, Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test findings revealed
      considerably different survival distributions were observed for the different
      categories of leptin immunostaining scores (P = 0.032). Negative leptin
      immunostaining is related to poor survival. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings
      support leptin clinical value in confirming BC diagnosis as well as prognosis.
      These results suggest that leptin molecule is an important biomarker that could
      identify type, grade, stage, lymph node involvement, relapse and prognosis in
      breast cancer.

TI  - Preferential expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 in male breast cancer.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Background: Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease often discovered in
      advanced stage; thus, in the setting of metastatic adenocarcinoma, breast origin 
      must be taken to account. Breast markers as NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and
      BRST-2 are established tools for labelling primary and metastatic female breast
      cancer; however, none of them has been sufficiently studied in male breast
      cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of these markers in
      male breast cancer. Materials and methods: Thirty consecutive cases of male
      breast cancer and eight loco-regional metastases were re-revaluated, assembled in
      tissue micro array (TMA), and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for
      NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2. The IHC stains were scored either
      positive or negative. In addition, concordant expression patterns of primary
      tumors and matched metastasis were noted. Results: 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors
      and 8 of 8 (100%) metastases were positive for NY-BR-1. 30 of 30 (100%) primary
      tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for GATA-3. 22 of 30 (73.3%)
      primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for Mammaglobin. 18 of
      30 (60%) primary tumors and 5 of 8 (62.5%) metastases were positive for BRST-2.
      Differences in staining percentage were not significant with Fisher’s exact test.
      Conclusion: We found a high sensitivity for all the markers analyzed. Moreover,
      the expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male
      breast cancer in primary and metastatic setting.

TI  - Quantification of sensitivity and resistance of breast cancer cell lines to
      anti-cancer drugs using GR metrics.
LID - 170166
AB  - Traditional means for scoring the effects of anti-cancer drugs on the growth and 
      survival of cell lines is based on relative cell number in drug-treated and
      control samples and is seriously confounded by unequal division rates arising
      from natural biological variation and differences in culture conditions. This
      problem can be overcome by computing drug sensitivity on a per-division basis.
      The normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) approach yields per-division metrics
      for drug potency (GR50) and efficacy (GRmax) that are analogous to the more
      familiar IC50 and Emax values. In this work, we report GR-based,
      proliferation-corrected, drug sensitivity metrics for ~4,700 pairs of breast
      cancer cell lines and perturbagens. Such data are broadly useful in understanding
      the molecular basis of therapeutic response and resistance. Here, we use them to 
      investigate the relationship between different measures of drug sensitivity and
      conclude that drug potency and efficacy exhibit high variation that is only
      weakly correlated. To facilitate further use of these data, computed GR curves
      and metrics can be browsed interactively at http://www.GRbrowser.org/.

TI  - Rehabilitation for a patient with anti-Yo antibody-positive paraneoplastic
      cerebellar degeneration caused by breast cancer: A case report and literature
      review.
LID - e8468
AB  - Rationale:: Rehabilitation for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) has
      been indicated as necessary. However, there are only a few reports on
      rehabilitation in PCD. We describe the course of physical and cognitive functions
      and activities of daily living (ADL) in a patient with PCD and examine the effect
      of rehabilitation, along with a review of relevant literature. Patient concerns::
      A 42-year-old woman experienced rapid deterioration in cerebellar symptoms and
      was unable to walk. The cerebellar symptoms improved after mastectomy, which was 
      performed 3 months after the onset of symptoms. However, the cerebellar symptoms 
      exacerbated 11 months after the onset of symptoms. She underwent immunotherapy
      because the level of anti-Yo antibodies was high, and anti-glutamic acid
      decarboxylase antibodies were detected. Diagnoses:: She was diagnosed with
      anti-Yo antibody-positive PCD caused by breast cancer. Interventions::
      Rehabilitation was performed preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 year after
      the onset of symptoms. Outcomes:: Her physical function and ADL improved after
      the surgery and at 1 year after the onset of symptoms. Finally, she regained the 
      ability to walk between parallel bars supported with one hand and a walking
      frame. Lessons:: Given the results of this case and the relevant literature, it
      appears that rehabilitation improves physical function and ADL after oncotherapy.
      Particularly, initiating treatment within three months of onset of symptoms may
      enable patients to walk without assistance.

TI  - Treatment of triple-negative breast cancer with Chinese herbal medicine: A
      prospective cohort study protocol.
LID - e8408
AB  - Introduction:: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is featured with the
      biological properties of strong aggressive behaviors, rapid disease progression, 
      high risk of recurrence and metastasis, and low disease free survival. Patients
      with this tumor are insensitive to the endocrine therapy and target treatment for
      HER-2; therefore, chemotherapy is often used as routine treatment in clinical.
      Because of the fact that a considerable number of patients seek for Chinese
      herbal medicine (CHM) treatment after operation and chemotherapy and (or)
      radiotherapy, it is thus need to evaluate the correlation between Chinese herbal 
      medicine treatment and prognosis. Methods and analysis:: This is a multicenter,
      prospective cohort study started in March 2016 in Beijing. A simple of 220
      participants diagnosed with TNBC were recruited from nine hospitals and are
      followed up every 3 to 6 months till March 2020. Detailed information of
      participants includes personal information, history of cancer, quality of life,
      symptoms of traditional Chinese medicine and fatigue status is taken face-to-face
      at baseline. Ethics and dissemination:: The study has received ethical approval
      from the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese
      Medicine affiliated to Capital Medical University (No.2016BL-014-01). Articles
      summarizing the primary results and ancillary analyses will be published in
      peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration:: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry:
      ChiCTR-OOC-16008246.

TI  - New approach to evaluate late arm impairment and effects of dragon boat activity 
      in breast cancer survivors.
LID - e8400
AB  - To verify the applicability of a new approach based on the strength curves (SCs) 
      methodology in late arm impairment in breast cancer (BC) survivors and to
      evaluate the effects of dragon boat (DB) activity on the late regaining of the
      muscle strength, upper limb impairment, and quality of life in patients
      undergoing surgery for BC.Retrospective observational study on 64 subjects
      (54.5 ± 9.7 years), 47 of them had undergone unilateral mastectomy surgery and
      were evaluated for late arm impairment. A clinical evaluation of the shoulder and
      compilation of functional assessment (DASH, Rowe, Constant–Murley) and quality of
      life (SF-36) scales were carried out. Assessment of muscle strength with SC
      obtained with isometric assessments and serratus anterior muscle test were
      performed.Differences between the SC are evident between healthy and operated
      subjects. Among the 3 groups of operated subjects the difference in strength is
      maximum at 0°. Statistically significant difference was found between operated
      and nonoperated only in SF-36 scale. No significant difference was found between 
      groups for shoulder instability and winged scapula.The SC can be used in the
      study of upper limb impairment after surgery for BC: measurements carried out at 
      1st degrees of the range of motion are more useful for clinicians. DB activity is
      useful to reduce the late arm impairment.

      intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with the Xoft Axxent® eBx® System for the
      management of early stage breast cancer in Taiwan.
LID - e0185876
AB  - Background: In this multi-center study, we report the patient selection criteria 
      for and preliminary oncologic outcomes associated with intraoperative
      radiotherapy (IORT) delivered by the Xoft Axxent® eBx® system for early-stage
      breast cancer in Taiwan. Methods: Patients with early breast cancer in Taiwan
      received breast conserving surgery and received IORT with Xoft Axxent® eBx®
      System during 2013–2015 was search from database of Taiwan IORT study cooperative
      group (T-IORTSCG). Patients’ clinicopathologic characteristics and early
      post-operative results were collected and reported. Results: During the study
      period, 26 hospitals in Taiwan performed a total of 261 Xoft IORT procedures for 
      breast cancer. The mean age of them was 52.9 ± 9.8 years (37–72), and tumor size 
      was 1.5 ± 0.8 cm (0.1–4.2 cm) for invasive cancer and 1.2 ± 0.8 cm (range,
      0.2–3.0 cm) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions. Lymph node metastasis
      was found in 6 (2.3%) patients. The patients received IORT in Taiwan differed
      markedly from those used in the ELIOT and TARGIT-A studies. Specifically,
      patients selected for IORT in Taiwan tended to be younger, their tumors tended to
      be larger and the prevalence of lymph node metastasis tended to be lower. Among
      these 261 patients, 8 (3.1%) patients required whole breast radiotherapy. During 
      a mean follow up of 15.6 months, locoregional recurrence was observed in 2 (0.8%)
      patients. Conclusion: In real world experience, patients received IORT differed
      quite significantly with criteria formulated by trials. The preliminary results
      of IORT in Taiwan showed it is well acceptable by patients and clinicians.

TI  - Comparison of patients with small (≤2 cm) breast cancer according to adherence to
      breast screening program.
LID - e0186988
AB  - Background: We investigated whether adherence to breast screening would yield a
      clinical benefit even among patients with small breast cancer (≤2 cm) by
      comparing differences between those who did and did not adhere to breast
      screening. Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with invasive T1 breast cancer
      and treated at Gangnam Severance Hospital from January 2006 to June 2014 were
      included. Of the 632 study patients, 450 and 182 were classified as
      screen-adherent and non-adherent. Adherence to the breast screening program was
      defined as the completion of breast screening examinations within 3 years before 
      cancer diagnosis. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival
      (MFS) were compared between the groups. Propensity score matching were applied to
      compare survival outcome. Results: Adherent patients were more likely to have a
      lower histologic grade (P < 0.001), high estrogen receptor expression (P =
      0.040), and lower HER2-positivity (P = 0.026). The adherent group had more
      favorable subtypes compared to the non-adherent group, with a greater percentage 
      of Luminal/HER2-negative subtype (66.7% vs. 56.5%) and a lower percentage of HER2
      subtype (8.3% vs. 16.7%). The RFS and MFS were significantly better in the
      adherent group (P = 0.003, 0.010, respectively). In the case-matched cohort,
      superior survival of the adherent group was maintained. Conclusions: Adherence to
      breast screening in patients with small breast tumors was associated with more
      favorable tumor biology and better prognosis. Our findings suggest that adherence
      to breast screening might offer clinical benefits in terms of tumor biology as
      well as early detection.

LID - e0187323
AB  - TAP1-TAP2 heterodimeric complexes are recognized as the transporter associated
      with antigen processing of major histocompatibility complex class I peptides for 
      recognition by tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In this study, we
      investigated the immunohistochemical expression of TAP1 and TAP2 in 160 patients 
      with breast cancer and correlated their expression levels with clinicopathologic 
      parameters. The median age of the patient cohort was 52.5 years (range, 30–86
      years). Both TAP1 and TAP2 immunohistochemical expression levels correlated
      significantly with breast cancer characteristics (P < .001). TAP1 expression
      levels were low to negative in stage I breast tumors. TAP1 and TAP2 levels were
      significantly higher in grade 3 tumors than low-grade (grade 1 and 2) tumors.
      TAP1 and TAP2 expression levels were not significantly different among different 
      levels of HER2-expressing tumors and did not vary by estrogen and progesterone
      receptor status or patient age. Both TAP1 and TAP2 overexpression in breast
      cancer might be an indicator of an aggressive breast tumor.

TI  - Application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in occult breast cancer: Five case
      reports.
LID - e8200
AB  - Rationale:: Although rare, occult breast cancer (OBC) originates from breast
      tissue. Its primary lesions cannot be identified by clinical examination or
      imaging; therefore, the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis remain controversial.
      Patient concerns:: This study comprised 5 female OBC patients who were admitted
      to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University for painless axillary
      lumps. Diagnoses:: 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) indicated metastasis in the ipsilateral
      axillary lymph nodes. No clear breast primary lesions were identified; other
      organs were also excluded as the primary site. Pathological biopsy confirmed
      axillary lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of
      the tumor to identify the source revealed that estrogen receptors (ERs) and
      progesterone receptors (PgRs) were positive in 2 cases, ER was positive and PR
      was negative in 1 case, and both were negative in 2 cases. Human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 was negative in all cases. All patients were diagnosed with
      OBC. Interventions:: All patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). One
      patient did not undergo follow-up therapy. The other 4 underwent total mastectomy
      plus axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy. Two patients also
      underwent endocrine therapy. Outcomes:: Patients were followed up for 9.0 to 72.0
      months. Four achieved pathological complete response. One patient experienced
      metastasis to the ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes 2.0 years later, which 
      was cleared after additional treatment. The other patients were tumor free.
      Lessons:: Here, we are reporting 5 cases of OBC treated with NAC that were
      evaluated by 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. This study suggests that NAC might lead to a
      positive outcome.

TI  - HER2 exon 27 mutations predict worse survival of breast cancer patients,
      especially in HER2‐negative patients.
PG  - 2832-9
AB  - The aims of this study were to assess the prognostic value of the HER2 exon 27
      mutations in breast cancer patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral
      blood leukocytes, and then HER2 exon 27 mutations were detected by direct
      sequencing. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan–Meier curves and the
      differences between the curves were compared by log‐rank tests. A total cohort of
      892 female patients with operable primary breast cancer was included in this
      study. The median follow‐up was 47 months. Of these 892 patients, 3.7% (33/892)
      had HER2 exon 27 mutations. Patients with the HER2 exon 27 mutations had a
      significant worse recurrence‐free survival (RFS, unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]
      2.42; 95% CI: 1.05–5.58; P = 0.032) and distant recurrence‐free survival (DRFS,
      unadjusted HR 2.81; 95% CI: 1.21–6.50; P = 0.012) than the patients with the
      wild‐type exon 27. Among the 673 patients with negative HER2 expression, 24
      mutants were found. Patients with the HER2 mutations showed a worse RFS
      (unadjusted HR 5.08; 95% CI: 2.14–12.02; P < 0.001) and DRFS (unadjusted HR 5.62;
      95% CI: 2.36–13.40; P < 0.001) than those patients with the wild‐type exon 27.
      Furthermore, the mutations remained as unfavorable independent predictors for RFS
      and DRFS. Breast cancer patients with HER2 exon 27 mutations have a worse
      survival, especially in HER2‐negative patients. HER2‐negative patients with HER2 
      exon 27 mutations are potential subgroup of breast cancer patients benefiting
      from HER2‐targeted therapy in future.

TI  - Expression and function of the miR-143/145 cluster in vitro and in vivo in human 
      breast cancer.
LID - e0186658
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as
      post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are dysregulated in
      cancer. Studies of miRNAs to explore their potential as diagnostic and prognostic
      markers are of great scientific interest. Here, we investigate the functional
      properties and expression of the miR-143/145 cluster in breast cancer (BC) in
      vitro and in vivo. The ER positive MCF7, the HER2 positive SK-BR-3, and the
      triple negative cell line MDA-MB-231 were used to assess cell proliferation and
      cell invasion. Expression of miRNA in 108 breast cancers in the Norwegian Women
      and Cancer Study and 44 benign tissue controls were analyzed by microarray and
      validated by RT-PCR. Further, in situ hybridization (ISH) was used to study the
      cellular and subcellular distribution of the miRNAs. In vitro, miR-143 promoted
      proliferation of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas miR-145 and the
      cotransfection of both miRNAs inhibited proliferation in all three cell lines.
      The cells’ invasive capacity was reduced after transfection and cotransfection of
      the miRNAs. In line with the tumor suppressive functions in vitro, the expression
      of miR-143 and miR-145 was lower in malignant compared to benign breast tissue,
      and lower in the more aggressive tumors with higher tumor grade, loss of ER and
      the basal-like phenotype. ISH revealed miR-143 to be cytoplasmatic and
      predominantly expressed in luminal cells in benign tissue, whilst miR-145 was
      nuclear and with strong staining in myoepithelial cells. Both miRNAs were present
      in malignant epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts in BC. This study
      demonstrates that miR-143 and -145 have functional properties and expression
      patterns typical for tumor suppressors, but the function is influenced by
      cellular factors such as cell type and miRNA cotransfection. Further, the nuclear
      functions of miR-145 should be explored for a more complete understanding of the 
      complexity of miRNA regulation and function in BC.

TI  - Breast density does not impact the ability of Videssa® Breast to detect breast
      cancer in women under age 50.
LID - e0186198
AB  - Breast density is associated with reduced imaging resolution in the detection of 
      breast cancer. A biochemical approach that is not affected by density would
      provide an important tool to healthcare professionals who are managing women with
      dense breasts and suspicious imaging findings. Videssa® Breast is a combinatorial
      proteomic biomarker assay (CPBA), comprised of Serum Protein Biomarkers (SPB) and
      Tumor Associated Autoantibodies (TAAb) integrated with patient-specific clinical 
      data to produce a diagnostic score that reliably detects breast cancer (BC) as an
      adjunctive tool to imaging. The performance of Videssa® Breast was evaluated in
      the dense (a and b) and non-dense (c and d) groups in a population of n = 545
      women under age 50. The sensitivity and specificity in the dense breast group
      were calculated to be 88.9% and 81.2%, respectively, and 92.3% and 86.6%,
      respectively, for the non-dense group. No significant differences were observed
      in the sensitivity (p = 1.0) or specificity (p = 0.18) between these groups. The 
      NPV was 99.3% and 99.1% in non-dense and dense groups, respectively. Unlike
      imaging, Videssa® Breast does not appear to be impacted by breast density; it can
      effectively detect breast cancer in women with dense and non-dense breasts alike.
      Thus, Videssa® Breast provides a powerful tool for healthcare providers when
      women with dense breasts present with challenging imaging findings. In addition, 
      Videssa® Breast provides assurance to women with dense breasts that they do not
      have breast cancer, reducing further anxiety in this higher risk patient
      population.

TI  - Using a novel T-lymph node ratio model to evaluate the prognosis of nonmetastatic
      breast cancer patients who received preoperative radiotherapy followed by
      mastectomy: An observational study.
LID - e8203
AB  - We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of postpathological characters in
      nonmetastatic breast cancer (NMBC) patients who received preoperative
      radiotherapy (PRT) followed by mastectomy (MAST).We conducted retrospective
      analyses using the data collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
      Results program of the National Cancer Institute. Univariate and multivariate
      analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Disease-specific survival
      was calculated by the Kaplan–Meier curve and validated by log rank test. The
      discriminations of independent risk factors and staging systems were compared by 
      the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and validated by
      Harrell concordance index (bootstrapping algorithm). Akaike information criterion
      (AIC) was applied to compare the difference of model.One thousand three hundred
      fifty NMBC patients who had received PRT followed by MAST from 1988 to 2013 were 
      included in the study. We found the metastatic lymph node ratio (mLNR) staging
      was a superior indicator than pN staging. Thus, we proposed a T-lymph node ratio 
      (T-NR) staging system with simplified-T categories (T0–3 and T4) and the mLNR
      staging. The novel T-NR staging system provided larger AUC (P = .024, .008,
      respectively) and the smaller AIC (P < .001) value than American Joint Committee 
      on Cancer staging system.The novel T-NR staging system performed more accurate
      survival prediction and better model fitness for NMBC patients who receive PRT
      followed by MAST, it may provide a wide applicability in clinical
      decision-making.

      triple-negative breast cancer patients of different ethnic groups in western
      China.
LID - e8155
AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate the expression of E-cadherin (E-cad)
      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) of Han and Uygur women patients in western China, and their relationship
      with clinical features of TNBC.Totally, 172 cases of Han TNBC patients and 79
      cases of Uighur TNBC patients were enrolled. The expressions of E-cad and VEGF
      were detected with immunohistochemistry. The correlation of E-cad and VEGF
      expression with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and histological grade were
      analyzed. The 5-year disease-free survival rate of the 2 groups was also
      evaluated.There was no significant difference in the 5-year disease-free survival
      rate (P > .05) and the expression of E-cad between the 2 groups. The positive
      rate of VEGF in Han was significantly lower than that in Uygur (P < .05). The
      expression of E-cad was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM
      stage, and histological grade (−1≤r < 1, P < .05). However, the expression of
      VEGF was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and TNM staging
      (0 < r < 1, P < 0.05), but not with histological grading.The expression of E-cad 
      and VEGF and their relationship with clinical features of TNBC suggest that Uygur
      TNBC patients might have different prognostic factors as compared with Han
      patients.

TI  - Genomic comparison of early-passage conditionally reprogrammed breast cancer
      cells to their corresponding primary tumors.
LID - e0186190
AB  - Conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) are epithelial cells that are directly
      isolated from patients’ specimens and propagated in vitro with feeder cells and a
      Rho kinase inhibitor. A number of these cells have been generated from biopsies
      of breast cancer patients, including ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive
      carcinomas. The characterization of their genomic signatures is essential to
      determine their ability to reflect the natural biology of their tumors of origin.
      In this study, we performed the genomic characterization of six newly established
      invasive breast cancer CRC cultures in comparison to the original patients’
      primary breast tumors (PBT) from which they derived. The CRCs and corresponding
      PBTs were simultaneously profiled by genome-wide array-CGH, targeted next
      generation sequencing and global miRNA expression to determine their molecular
      similarities in the patterns of copy number alterations (CNAs), gene mutations
      and miRNA expression levels, respectively. The CRCs’ epithelial cells content and
      ploidy levels were also evaluated by flow cytometry. A similar level of CNAs was 
      observed in the pairs of CRCs/PBTs analyzed by array-CGH, with >95% of overlap
      for the most frequently affected cytobands. Consistently, targeted next
      generation sequencing analysis showed the retention of specific somatic variants 
      in the CRCs as present in their original PBTs. Global miRNA profiling closely
      clustered the CRCs with their PBTs (Pearson Correlation, ANOVA paired test,
      P<0.05), indicating also similarity at the miRNA expression level; the retention 
      of tumor-specific alterations in a subset of miRNAs in the CRCs was further
      confirmed by qRT-PCR. These data demonstrated that the human breast cancer CRCs
      of this study maintained at early passages the overall copy number, gene
      mutations and miRNA expression patterns of their original tumors. The further
      characterization of these cells by other molecular and cellular phenotypes at
      late cell passages, are required to further expand their use as a unique and
      representative ex-vivo tumor model for basic science and translational breast
      cancer studies.

      vaccine against breast cancer in mice xenograft model.
LID - e0185099
AB  - One of the challenging issues in vaccine development is peptide and adjuvant
      delivery into target cells. In this study, we developed a vaccine and therapeutic
      delivery system to increase cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against a
      breast cancer model overexpressing HER2/neu.Gp2, a HER2/neu-derived peptide, was 
      conjugated to Maleimide-mPEG2000-DSPE micelles and post inserted into liposomes
      composed of DMPC, DMPG phospholipids, and fusogenic lipid
      dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) containing monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)
      adjuvant (DMPC-DMPG-DOPE-MPL-Gp2). BALB/c mice were immunized with different
      formulations and the immune response was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. ELISpot 
      and intracellular cytokine analysis by flow cytometry showed that the mice
      vaccinated with Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 incited the highest number of IFN-γ+ in CD8+
      cells and CTL response. The immunization led to lower tumor sizes and longer
      survival time compared to the other groups of mice immunized and treated with the
      Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 formulation in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments.
      These results showed that co-formulation of DOPE and MPL conjugated with GP2
      peptide not only induces high antitumor immunity but also enhances therapeutic
      efficacy in TUBO mice model. Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 formulation could be a promising
      vaccine and a therapeutic delivery system against HER2 positive cancers and
      merits further investigation.

TI  - Prospective, multicenter French study evaluating the clinical impact of the
      Breast Cancer Intrinsic Subtype-Prosigna® Test in the management of early-stage
      breast cancers.
LID - e0185753
AB  - Purpose: The Prosigna® breast cancer prognostic gene signature assay identifies a
      gene-expression profile that permits the classification of tumors into subtypes
      and gives a score for the risk of recurrence (ROR) at 10 years. The primary
      objective of this multicenter study was to evaluate the impact of Prosigna’s
      assay information on physicians’ adjuvant treatment decisions in patients with
      early-stage breast cancer. Secondary objectives were to assess confidence of
      practitioners in their therapeutic recommendations before and after the added
      information provided by the Prosigna assay; and to evaluate the emotional state
      of patients before and after the Prosigna test results. Methods: Consecutive
      patients with invasive early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective, 
      observational, multicenter study carried out in 8 hospitals in France. The
      Prosigna test was carried out on surgical specimens using the nCounter® Analysis 
      System located at the Institut Curie. Both before and after receiving the
      Prosigna test results, physicians completed treatment confidence questionnaires
      and patients completed questionnaires concerning their state of anxiety, the
      difficulties felt in face of the therapy and quality of life. Information was
      also collected at 6 months regarding the physicians’ opinion on the test results 
      and the patients’ degree of anxiety, difficulties with therapy and quality of
      life. Results: Between March 2015 and January 2016, 8 study centers in France
      consecutively enrolled 210 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)
      positive, human epidermal growth hormone-2 (HER-2) negative, and node negative
      tumors, either stage 1 or stage 2. Intrinsic tumor subtypes as assessed by the
      Prosigna test were 114 (58.2%) Luminal A, 79 (40.3%) Luminal B, 1 (0.5%) HER-2
      enriched (HER-2E), and 2 (1.0%) basal-like. Before receiving the Prosigna test
      results, physicians categorized tumor subtypes based on immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) as Luminal A in 126 (64%) patients and Luminal B in 70 (36%) patients, an
      overall discordance rate of 25%. The availability of Prosigna assay results was
      significantly associated with the likelihood of change in treatment
      recommendations, with 34 patients (18%) having their treatment plan changed from 
      Adjuvant Chemotherapy to No Adjuvant Chemotherapy or vice versa (p<0.001,
      Fisher’s exact test). Prosigna test results also decreased patients’ anxiety
      about the chosen adjuvant therapy, and improved emotional well-being and measures
      of personal perceptions of uncertainty. Conclusions: The results of this
      prospective decision impact study are consistent with 2 previous, identically
      designed studies carried out in Spain and Germany. The availability of Prosigna
      test results increased the confidence of treating physicians in their adjuvant
      treatment decisions, and led to an 18% change in chemotherapy treatment plan
      (from Adjuvant Chemotherapy to No Adjuvant Chemotherapy or vice versa). Prosigna 
      testing decreased anxiety and improved measures of health-related quality of life
      in patients facing adjuvant therapy. The 25% discordance between Prosigna test
      and IHC subtyping underlines the importance of molecular testing for optimal
      systemic therapy indications in early breast cancer.

TI  - A comparison of breast cancer survival among young, middle-aged, and elderly
      patients in southern Iran using Cox and empirical Bayesian additive hazard
      models.
LID - e2017043
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A survival analysis of breast cancer patients in southern Iran
      according to age has yet to be conducted. This study aimed to quantify the
      factors contributing to a poor prognosis, using Cox and empirical Bayesian
      additive hazard (EBAH) models, among young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-64
      years), and elderly (≥ 65 years) women. METHODS: Data from 1,574 breast cancer
      patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2012 in the cancer registry of Fars Province
      (southern Iran) were stratified into 3 age groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was
      used to estimate the overall survival rates. Cox and EBAH models were applied to 
      each age category, and the Akaike information criterion was used to assess the
      goodness-of-fit of the 2 hazard models. RESULTS: As of December 2012, 212 women
      (13.5%) in our study population had died, of whom 43 were young (15.3%), 134
      middle-aged (11.8%), and 35 elderly (22.3%). The 5-year survival probability by
      age category was 0.83 (standard error [SE], 0.03), 0.88 (SE, 0.01), and 0.75 (SE,
      0.04), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Nottingham Prognostic Index was the most
      effective prognostic factor. The model based on Bayesian methodology performed
      better with various sample sizes than the Cox model, which is the most widely
      used method of survival analysis.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of late-course concurrent versus sequential
      chemoradiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary surgery in locally advanced
      breast cancer.
LID - e8252
AB  - Background:: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy could increase the local control rate
      in patients with high recurrence risk after breast-conserving surgery, but the
      effect of concurrent chemoradiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary dissection
      is not clear. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of late-course
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) versus sequential therapy (SCRT) after
      mastectomy and axillary surgery in locally advanced breast cancer. Methods:: This
      was a randomized controlled trial of 155 patients with stage pT3–4p N1–3c M0 or
      pAnyT pN2–3c M0 breast cancer undergoing
      5-fluorouracil+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (FEC-D)
      chemotherapy after mastectomy and axillary dissection. Patients were randomized
      to the CCRT group (intensity-modulated radiation therapy was performed
      concurrently with docetaxel) or to the SCRT group (radiotherapy after
      chemotherapy). Recurrences, adverse reactions, and short-term effects were
      observed. Results:: All the patients completed the planned therapy. The median
      follow-up was 39 (range, 16–62) months. Compared with SCRT, the 3-year
      local-regional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) in the CCRT group was improved
      (81.8% vs 92.3%, P = .046). There was no significant difference in 3-year
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In the pT3–4 pN1–3 cM0
      subgroup, the 3-year local recurrence-free survival and DFS were significantly
      improved in the CCRT group (69.4% vs 88.2%, P = .036; and 41.7% vs 72.6%,
      P = .049, respectively). No significant difference was observed adverse reactions
      between the 2 groups. Conclusion:: LRFS of patients with locally advanced
      invasive breast cancer after mastectomy and axillary surgery was better with CCRT
      than with SCRT and with similar profiles of adverse reactions. The DFS of
      patients staged pT3–4 pN1–3 cM0 was also improved.

TI  - The cholesterol metabolite 27 hydroxycholesterol facilitates breast cancer
      metastasis through its actions on immune cells.
LID - 864
AB  - Obesity and elevated circulating cholesterol are risk factors for breast cancer
      recurrence, while the use of statins, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors widely 
      used for treating hypercholesterolemia, is associated with improved disease-free 
      survival. Here, we show that cholesterol mediates the metastatic effects of a
      high-fat diet via its oxysterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol. Ablation or
      inhibition of CYP27A1, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in
      27-hydroxycholesterol biosynthesis, significantly reduces metastasis in relevant 
      animal models of cancer. The robust effects of 27-hydroxycholesterol on
      metastasis requires myeloid immune cell function, and it was found that this
      oxysterol increases the number of polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells at
      distal metastatic sites. The pro-metastatic actions of 27-hydroxycholesterol
      requires both polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells, and
      27-hydroxycholesterol treatment results in a decreased number of cytotoxic CD8+T 
      lymphocytes. Therefore, through its actions on γδ-T cells and
      polymorphonuclear-neutrophils, 27-hydroxycholesterol functions as a biochemical
      mediator of the metastatic effects of hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Authentication of M14 melanoma cell line proves misidentification of MDA‐MB‐435
      breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 561-72
AB  - A variety of analytical approaches have indicated that melanoma cell line
      UCLA‐SO‐M14 (M14) and breast carcinoma cell line MDA‐MB‐435 originate from a
      common donor. This indicates that at some point in the past, one of these cell
      lines became misidentified, meaning that it ceased to correspond to the reported 
      donor and instead became falsely identified (through cross‐contamination or other
      means) as a cell line from a different donor. Initial studies concluded that
      MDA‐MB‐435 was the misidentified cell line and M14 was the authentic cell line,
      although contradictory evidence has been published, resulting in further
      confusion. To address this question, we obtained early samples of the melanoma
      cell line (M14), a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same donor (ML14), and donor
      serum preserved at the originator's institution. M14 samples were cryopreserved
      in December 1975, before MDA‐MB‐435 cells were established in culture. Through a 
      series of molecular characterizations, including short tandem repeat (STR)
      profiling and cytogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that later samples of M14 and
      MDA‐MB‐435 correspond to samples of M14 frozen in 1975, to the lymphoblastoid
      cell line ML14, and to the melanoma donor's STR profile, sex and blood type. This
      work demonstrates conclusively that M14 is the authentic cell line and MDA‐MB‐435
      is misidentified. With clear provenance information and authentication testing of
      early samples, it is possible to resolve debates regarding the origins of
      problematic cell lines that are widely used in cancer research.

TI  - Association between weight gain during adjuvant chemotherapy for early‐stage
      breast cancer and survival outcomes.
PG  - 2515-22
AB  - Obese and overweight women have an increased risk of breast cancer and worse
      outcomes at the time of diagnosis. Women tend to gain weight after breast cancer 
      diagnosis and during chemotherapy for early‐stage disease, which may in turn
      increase risk for worse outcomes. We examined if weight gained during adjuvant
      chemotherapy was associated with worse survival outcomes. We queried our database
      for data on patients who received adjuvant third‐generation chemotherapy for
      early‐stage breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses by Cox regression
      were performed for survival outcomes across three categories according to BMI
      variation from start to end of chemotherapy: >0.5 kg/m2 loss or gain and stable
      BMI (±0.5 kg/m2). We included 1998 patients in this study. Women over 50 years
      old and postmenopausal were more likely to lose weight during adjuvant
      chemotherapy, whereas women under 30 years old gained more weight (P < 0.001). At
      1 year postchemotherapy, patients tended to return to their original weight
      (ρ = −0.3, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, BMI increase of >0.5 kg/m2
      compared to maintaining BMI was marginally associated with increased locoregional
      recurrence risk (HR: 2.53; 95% CI, 1.18–5.45; P = 0.017), adjusting for grade,
      stage, and radiation delivery. Weight variation during adjuvant chemotherapy for 
      early‐stage breast cancer may occur as both weight gain and weight loss in a
      balanced manner. Furthermore, this variation seems to be transient in nature and 
      does not appear to significantly influence recurrence rates and overall survival.

TI  - Prognostic and clinicopathological value of Twist expression in breast cancer: A 
      meta-analysis.
LID - e0186191
AB  - Background: Despite initial indications that the transcription factor Twist could
      be used as a breast cancer prognostic marker, there still exists some controversy
      about its reliability. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the
      relationship between Twist expression and prognosis in breast carcinoma.
      Materials and methods: We identified eligible studies that reported an
      association between Twist expression and breast cancer prognosis by searching the
      literature in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases,
      through June 5, 2017. Studies investigating Twist protein or mRNA expression as
      well as reporting survival data in breast cancer were included. The pooled hazard
      ratio (HR) and odds radio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used 
      to estimate associations. Results: A total of 2,671 patients from seven included 
      studies were assessed, and the data indicated that increased Twist expression
      significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.15; 95% CI,
      1.00–1.33; P = 0.04) in breast cancer. In addition, we also observed a
      significant correlation of elevated Twist expression with larger tumor size (OR, 
      1.92; 95% CI, 1.31–2.81; P = 0.0009), lymph node involvement (OR, 3.81; 95% CI,
      1.16–12.54; P = 0.03), higher nuclear grade (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06–2.00; P =
      0.02), and positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (OR,
      1.49; 95% CI, 1.06–2.09; P = 0.02). However, no correlation between Twist
      expression and disease-free survival (DFS), age, estrogen receptor (ER) status,
      and progesterone receptor (PR) status was observed. Conclusions: Our results
      demonstrate that Twist over-expression is a statistically significant indicator
      of OS in breast cancer. In addition, our meta-analysis shows that increased Twist
      expression is significantly associated with larger tumor size, lymph node
      involvement, higher nuclear grade, and positive HER2 status.

TI  - Frequency of breast cancer with hereditary risk features in Spain: Analysis from 
      GEICAM “El Álamo III” retrospective study.
LID - e0184181
AB  - Purpose: To determine the frequency of breast cancer (BC) patients with
      hereditary risk features in a wide retrospective cohort of patients in Spain.
      Methods: a retrospective analysis was conducted from 10,638 BC patients diagnosed
      between 1998 and 2001 in the GEICAM registry “El Álamo III”, dividing them into
      four groups according to modified ESMO and SEOM hereditary cancer risk criteria: 
      Sporadic breast cancer group (R0); Individual risk group (IR); Familial risk
      group (FR); Individual and familial risk group (IFR) with both individual and
      familial risk criteria. Results: 7,641 patients were evaluable. Of them, 2,252
      patients (29.5%) had at least one hereditary risk criteria, being subclassified
      in: FR 1.105 (14.5%), IR 970 (12.7%), IFR 177 (2.3%). There was a higher
      frequency of newly diagnosed metastatic patients in the IR group (5.1% vs 3.2%, p
      = 0.02). In contrast, in RO were lower proportion of big tumors (> T2) (43.8% vs 
      47.4%, p = 0.023), nodal involvement (43.4% vs 48.1%, p = 0.004) and lower
      histological grades (20.9% G3 for the R0 vs 29.8%) when compared to patients with
      any risk criteria. Conclusions: Almost three out of ten BC patients have at least
      one hereditary risk cancer feature that would warrant further genetic counseling.
      Patients with hereditary cancer risk seems to be diagnosed with worse prognosis
      factors.

TI  - Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of central venous catheter‐related
      thromboembolism in breast cancer patients: the CAVECCAS study.
PG  - 2732-44
AB  - Previous epidemiologic studies investigating central venous catheter
      (CVC)‐related venous thromboembolism (CRT) were conducted in heterogenous cancer 
      populations and data in breast cancer (BC) remain limited. To investigate the
      Doppler ultrasound (DUS)‐CRT incidence, risk factors and outcomes in BC, we
      designed a prospective, multicenter cohort of nonmetastatic invasive BC patients 
      undergoing insertion of a CVC for chemotherapy. All patients underwent
      double‐blind DUS before, 7, 30, and 90 days after CVC insertion and a 6 months
      clinical follow‐up. Symptomatic DUS‐CRT were treated by anticoagulants. D‐Dimers,
      thrombin generation, and platelet‐derived microparticles were measured before and
      2 days after CVC placement. In DUS‐CRT patients, a nested case–control study
      analyzed the role of thrombophilia. Among 524 patients, the DUS‐CRT (14
      symptomatic, 46 asymptomatic) cumulative probability was 9.6% at 3 months and
      11.5% at 6 months (overall incidence rate: 2.18/100 patient‐months). Ten/14
      symptomatic DUS‐CRT were detected on double‐blind DUS before the clinical
      symptoms, and 3/14 had a simultaneous pulmonary embolism. No clinical thrombotic 
      event subsequently occurred in untreated asymptomatic DUS‐CRT. Age >50 years (OR,
      1.80; 95% CI, 1.01–3.22), BMI >30 kg/m² (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.46–4.76) and
      comorbidities (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.18–3.56) were associated with DUS‐CRT. No
      biomarkers was found to predict DUS‐CRT. In multivariate analysis, BMI >30 kg/m² 
      (OR, 2.66; 95%CI, 1.46–4.84) and lobular carcinoma histology (OR, 2.56; 95%CI,
      1.32–4.96) remained the only significant DUS‐CRT risk factors. Thrombophilia did 
      not account for DUS‐CRT. Only clinical parameters identified high risk DUS‐CRT
      patients who may be considered for thromboprophylaxis.

TI  - Development and validation of a nomogram predicting the overall survival of stage
      IV breast cancer patients.
PG  - 2586-94
AB  - This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the overall survival (OS) of
      stage IV breast cancer patients. We searched the National Cancer Database (NCDB) 
      for stage IV breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2013. Predictors
      of OS were identified and a nomogram was developed and validated using
      concordance index (C‐index), calibration plots, and risk group stratifications. A
      total of 7199 patients from the NCDB were included in the study. With a median
      follow‐up of 25.7 months, the 1‐year and 3‐year OS rates were 80.6% and 52.5%,
      respectively. Race, age, comorbidity status, T‐stage, grade, ER/PR/Her2 status,
      the presence of lung/liver/brain metastasis, surgery, radiotherapy, and
      chemotherapy were significantly associated with OS. The developed nomogram had a 
      C‐index of 0.722 (95% CI 0.710–0.734) and 0.725 (95% CI 0.713–0.736) in the
      training and the validation cohorts, respectively. The predicted survival using
      the nomogram is well correlated with actual OS. The nomogram was able to stratify
      patients into different risk groups, among which the survival benefit of local
      therapy varied. We developed a nomogram to predict the overall survival of stage 
      IV breast cancer patients. Prospectively designed studies with international
      collaborations are needed to further validate our nomogram.

TI  - Delayed presentation and diagnosis of breast cancer in African women: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 659-671.e7
AB  - Purpose: Africa has low breast cancer incidence rates but high mortality rates
      from this disease due to poor survival. Delays in presentation and diagnosis are 
      major determinants of breast cancer survival, but these have not been
      comprehensively investigated in Africa. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and Global
      Health were searched to identify studies reporting on delays in presentation
      and/or diagnosis of breast cancer published between January 1, 2000 and May 31,
      2016. Data were synthesized in narrative, tabular, and graphical forms.
      Meta-analyses were not possible due to between-study differences in the way
      delays were reported. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the review.
      Study-specific average times between symptom recognition and presentation to a
      health care provider ranged from less than 1 to 4 months in North Africa and from
      less than 3 to greater than 6 months in sub-Saharan Africa. Study-specific
      average times from presentation to diagnosis were less than 1 month in North
      Africa but ranged from less than 3 to greater than 6 months in sub-Saharan
      Africa. Reported reasons for these delays included patient-mediated (e.g.,
      socioeconomic factors) and health system–mediated factors (e.g., referral
      pathways). Conclusions: This systematic review revealed marked delays in
      presentation and diagnosis of breast cancer in Africa. Identification of their
      drivers is crucial to the development of appropriate control strategies in the
      continent.

TI  - Awareness of breast cancer and breast self-examination among female undergraduate
      students in a higher teachers training college in Cameroon.
LID - 91
AB  - Introduction: The incidence of breast cancer (BCa) in Cameroon is on the rise and
      accounts for a leading cause of mortality. An understanding of the knowledge and 
      practices on breast cancer and breast self-examination (BSE) among teachers are
      important first steps which will guide the designing of interventions aimed at
      raising awareness across the general population. Methods: We conducted a
      cross-sectional study in April 2016 involving 345 consenting female undergraduate
      students in the Higher Teachers Training College, Bambili, Cameroon. Data was
      collected using a pretested self-administered questionnaire and analysed using
      descriptive methods. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 22.5±3.2years
      and a vast majority (n = 304, 88.1%) had heard about BCa primarily from the
      television/radio (n=196, 64.5%). Overall, less than a quarter (n=65, 21.4%) of
      respondents who had heard about BCa had sufficient knowledge on its risk factors 
      and signs/symptoms. A plurality (53.3%) thought BCa can be prevented via
      vaccination while over a third (38.7%) opined that BCa can be treated
      spiritually. Less than half (47%) of respondents who had heard about BCa had
      heard about BSE amongst which only 55 (38.5%) had ever practiced it. Conclusion: 
      Though most students are aware of the existence of breast cancer, their overall
      knowledge on its risk factors and clinical presentation is insufficient with a
      concomitant low practice of BSE. These highlighted gaps warrants intensification 
      of sensitization campaigns and educational programmes in order to raise knowledge
      levels and enhance prevention strategies that would aid in reducing the burden of
      breast cancer in Cameroon.

TI  - Thoracic paravertebral regional anesthesia for pain relief in patients with
      breast cancer surgery.
LID - e8107
AB  - Background:: The present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of
      thoracic paravertebral regional anesthesia (TPVBRA) in patients with breast
      cancer surgery. Methods:: In total, 72 patients undergoing breast cancer surgery 
      were randomly divided into an intervention group and a control group; each group 
      contained 36 subjects. Both groups received TPVBRA with 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine. 
      In addition, subjects in the intervention group also received an additional
      1 μg/kg dexmedetomidine. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP),
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pain intensity (measured by visual analogue
      scale, VAS), and analgesic consumption were assessed; adverse events were also
      recorded. Results:: Significant differences were observed in HR (P < .05), SBP
      (P < .05), and DBP (P < .05) at the 30-minute point during surgery between the 2 
      groups. In addition, the time of the first administration of analgesia (P = .043)
      and the mean consumption of analgesic agents (P = .035) in the intervention group
      were much better than those in the control group. However, no significant
      differences in HR or VAS were found at any time point after surgery (P > .05).
      Furthermore, similar adverse events were detected in both groups (P > .05).
      Conclusion:: The results of this study showed that TPVBRA combined with
      bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine can enhance the duration and quality of analgesia
      without serious adverse events.

TI  - Androgen receptor expression on circulating tumor cells in metastatic breast
      cancer.
LID - e0185231
AB  - Purpose: Androgen receptor (AR) is frequently detected in breast cancers, and
      AR-targeted therapies are showing activity in AR-positive (AR+) breast cancer.
      However, the role of AR in breast cancers is still not fully elucidated and the
      biology of AR in breast cancer remains incompletely understood. Circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) can serve as prognostic and diagnostic tools, prompting us to
      measure AR protein expression and conduct genomic analyses on CTCs in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Blood samples from patients with
      metastatic breast cancer were deposited on glass slides, subjected to nuclear
      staining with DAPI, and reacted with fluorescent-labeled antibodies to detect
      CD45, cytokeratin (CK), and biomarkers of interest (AR, estrogen receptor [ER],
      and HER2) on all nucleated cells. The stained slides were scanned and enumerated 
      by non-enrichment-based non-biased approach independent of cell surface
      epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) using the Epic Sciences CTC platform.
      Data were analyzed using established digital pathology algorithms. Results: Of 68
      patients, 51 (75%) had at least 1 CTC, and 49 of these 51 (96%) had
      hormone-receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative primary tumors. AR was expressed in
      CK+ CTCs in 10 patients. Of these 10 patients, 3 also had ER expression in CK+
      CTCs. Single cell genomic analysis of 78 CTCs from 1 of these 3 patients
      identified three distinct copy number patterns. AR+ cells had a lower frequency
      of chromosomal changes than ER+ and HER2+ cells. Conclusions: CTC enumeration and
      analysis using no enrichment or selection provides a non-biased approach to
      detect AR expression and chromosomal aberrations in CTCs in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer. The heterogeneity of intrapatient AR expression in CTCs
      leads to the new hypothesis that patients with AR+ CTCs have heterogeneous
      disease with multiple drivers. Further studies are warranted to investigate the
      clinical applicability of AR+ CTCs and their heterogeneity.

TI  - Preoperative indication for systemic therapy extended to patients with
      early-stage breast cancer using multiparametric 7-tesla breast MRI.
LID - e0183855
AB  - Purpose: To establish a preoperative decision model for accurate indication of
      systemic therapy in early-stage breast cancer using multiparametric MRI at
      7-tesla field strength. Materials and methods: Patients eligible for
      breast-conserving therapy were consecutively included. Patients underwent
      conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7-tesla
      breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) indication for systemic therapy was
      established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10-year
      risk-estimates of breast cancer mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online.
      Preoperative indication was estimated using similar guidelines, but from
      conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative
      and postoperative indication, and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. 
      MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on
      31-phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on
      diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced
      (DCE)-MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative indication
      from preoperatively available data. Results: We included 46 women (age: 43-74yrs)
      with 48 invasive carcinomas. Postoperatively, 20 patients (43%) had positive, and
      26 patients (57%) negative indication for systemic therapy. Using conventional
      workup, positive preoperative indication agreed excellently with positive
      postoperative indication (N = 8/8; 100%). Negative preoperative indication was
      correct in only 26/38 (68%) patients. However, 31P-MRS score (p = 0.030) and
      tumor size (p = 0.002) were associated with the postoperative indication. The
      decision model shows that negative indication is correct in 21/22 (96%) patients 
      when exempting tumors larger than 2.0cm on DCE-MRI or with PME>PDE ratios at
      31P-MRS. Conclusions: Preoperatively, positive indication for systemic therapy is
      highly accurate. Negative indication is highly accurate (96%) for tumors sized
      ≤2,0cm on DCE-MRI and with PME≤PDE ratios on 31P-MRS.

LID - 692
AB  - Molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers is critical for non-invasive accurate
      cancer detection and risk-stratification in precision healthcare. A
      peptide-targeted tri-gadolinium nitride metallofullerene, ZD2-Gd3N@C80, is
      synthesised for sensitive molecular magnetic resonance imaging of extradomain-B
      fibronectin in aggressive tumours. ZD2-Gd3N@C80 has superior r1 and r2
      relaxivities of 223.8 and 344.7 mM−1 s−1 (1.5 T), respectively. It generates
      prominent contrast enhancement in aggressive MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast
      cancer in mice at a low dose (1.7 µmol kg−1, 1 T), but not in oestrogen
      receptor-positive MCF-7 tumours. Strong tumour contrast enhancement is
      consistently observed in other triple negative breast cancer models, but not in
      low-risk slow-growing tumours. The dose of the contrast agent for effective
      molecular MRI is only slightly higher than that of ZD2-Cy5.5 (0.5 µmol kg−1) in
      fluorescence imaging. These results demonstrate that high-sensitivity molecular
      magnetic resonance imaging with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 may provide accurate detection and
      risk-stratification of high-risk tumours for precision healthcare of breast
      cancer.

TI  - The curative effects of radiotherapy-based therapies for human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: A meta-analysis.
LID - e7946
AB  - Aim:: This meta-analysis was designed to fully assess the curative effects of
      radiotherapy-based therapies for human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC). Methods:: English articles were retrieved 
      through searching Cochrane library, PubMed, and Embase databases updated to
      February 2017. Studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. The curative effects of radiotherapy-based therapies forHER2+ BC
      patients were assessed using hazard rates (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs), as well as 
      their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, Egger test was used to assess 
      publication bias, followed by sensitivity analysis. All statistic methods were
      conducted using R 3.12 software. Results:: A total of 9 eligible studies were
      included into this meta-analysis, which involved 2236 HER2+ BC patients. Egger
      test showed that the eligible studies had no publication bias (t = 2.198,
      P = .05918). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were stable.
      HER2+ BC patients in radiotherapy group had lower locoregional recurrences than
      those in other groups. Moreover, meta-analysis showed that no significant
      difference was found between HER2+ BC patients in radiotherapy group and other
      groups on the 1-year overall survival (P = 0.5263, I2 = 65.4%), 3-year overall
      survival (P = 0.4591, I2 = 0), and 5-year overall survival (P = 0.06277, I2 = 0).
      Conclusion:: Radiotherapy-based therapies might have certain advantages in
      treating HER2+ BC patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of acupuncture for breast cancer related lymphedema: protocol for a
      single-blind, sham-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial.
LID - 467
AB  - Background: Although various treatments for breast cancer related lymphedema
      exist, there is still a need for a more effective and convenient approach. Pilot 
      studies and our clinical observations suggested that acupuncture may be a
      potential option. This study aims to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture on
      BCRL and evaluate its safety using a rigorously designed trial. Methods/Design:
      Women who are clinically diagnosed as unilateral BCRL, with a 10% to 40% increase
      in volume compared to the unaffected arm, will be recruited. Following baseline
      assessment, participants will be randomized to either the real acupuncture group 
      or sham-acupuncture group at a ratio of 1:1, and given a standard real
      acupuncture or sham-acupuncture treatment accordingly on both arms followed by
      the same usual care of decongestive therapy. Volume measurements of both arms
      will be performed for every participant after each treatment. Data collected at
      baseline and the last session will be used to calculate the primary outcome and
      secondary outcomes. Other data will be exploited for interim analyses and trial
      monitoring. The primary outcome is the absolute reduced limb volume ratio.
      Secondary outcomes are incidence of adverse events and change in quality of life.
      A t test or non-parameter test will be used to compare the difference between two
      groups, and assess the overall effectiveness of acupuncture using the SPSS
      software (version 12). Discussion: This study will help expand our knowledge
      about the effectiveness of acupuncture on BCRL, and how acupuncture might be used
      in the management of this condition. Acupuncture may be a promising complement or
      alternative to conventional lymphedema treatment methods, if its effectiveness is
      confirmed. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02803736 (Registered on
      October 31, 2016).  Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this

TI  - A tool to automatically analyze electromagnetic tracking data from high dose rate
      brachytherapy of breast cancer patients.
LID - e0183608
AB  - During High Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-BT) the spatial position of the
      radiation source inside catheters implanted into a female breast is determined
      via electromagnetic tracking (EMT). Dwell positions and dwell times of the
      radiation source are established, relative to the patient’s anatomy, from an
      initial X-ray-CT-image. During the irradiation treatment, catheter displacements 
      can occur due to patient movements. The current study develops an automatic
      analysis tool of EMT data sets recorded with a solenoid sensor to assure
      concordance of the source movement with the treatment plan. The tool combines
      machine learning techniques such as multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), ensemble
      empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and
      particle filter (PF) to precisely detect and quantify any mismatch between the
      treatment plan and actual EMT measurements. We demonstrate that movement
      artifacts as well as technical signal distortions can be removed automatically
      and reliably, resulting in artifact-free reconstructed signals. This is a
      prerequisite for a highly accurate determination of any deviations of dwell
      positions from the treatment plan.

TI  - The quality of invasive breast cancer care for low reimbursement rate patients: A
      retrospective study.
LID - e0184866
AB  - Though evidence-based treatments have been recommended for breast cancer,
      underuse of the treatments was still observed. To certain extent, patients’
      access to care, which can be enhanced by increasing the coverage of health
      insurance, could account for the current underuse in recommended care. This study
      aimed to examine the association between different proportions of reimbursement
      and quality of recommended breast cancer care, as well as length of hospital
      stay. In this retrospective study, 3669 patients diagnosed with invasive breast
      cancer between 1 June, 2011 and 30 June, 2013 were recruited. Seven quality
      indicators from preoperative diagnosis procedures to adjuvant therapy and one
      composite indicator were selected as dependent variables. Logistic regression and
      generalized linear models were used to explore the association between quality of
      care and length of hospital stay with different reimbursement rates. Compared
      with UEBMI (urban employment basic medical insurance), which represented high
      level reimbursement rate, patients with lower rates of reimbursement were less
      likely to receive core biopsy, HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2)
      testing, BCS (breast conserving surgery), SLNB (sentinel lymph nodes biopsy),
      adjuvant therapy and hormonal treatment. No significant difference in
      preoperative length of hospital stay was observed among the three insurance
      schemes, however URBMI (urban resident basic medical insurance) insured patients 
      stayed longer for total length of hospital stay. Significant disparities in
      utilization of evidence-based breast cancer care among patients with different
      proportions of reimbursement were observed. Patients with lower rate of
      reimbursement were less likely to receive recommended care. Our findings could
      provide important support for further healthcare reform and quality improvement
      in breast cancer care.

      optimization, characterization and its anticancer activity in breast cancer
      cells.
PG  - 6841-55
AB  - The aim of this study was to synthesize selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) using cell
      suspension and total cell protein of Acinetobacter sp. SW30 and optimize its
      synthesis by studying the influence of physiological and physicochemical
      parameters. Also, we aimed to compare its anticancer activity with that of
      chemically synthesized SeNPs in breast cancer cells. Cell suspension of
      Acinetobacter sp. SW30 was exposed to various physiological and physicochemical
      conditions in the presence of sodium selenite to study their effects on the
      synthesis and morphology of SeNPs. Breast cancer cells (4T1, MCF-7) and noncancer
      cells (NIH/3T3, HEK293) were exposed to different concentrations of SeNPs. The 18
      h grown culture with 2.7×109 cfu/mL could synthesize amorphous nanospheres of
      size 78 nm at 1.5 mM and crystalline nanorods at above 2.0 mM Na2SeO3
      concentration. Polygonal-shaped SeNPs of average size 79 nm were obtained in the 
      supernatant of 4 mg/mL of total cell protein of Acinetobacter sp. SW30. Chemical 
      SeNPs showed more anticancer activity than SeNPs synthesized by Acinetobacter sp.
      SW30 (BSeNPs), but they were found to be toxic to noncancer cells also. However, 
      BSeNPs were selective against breast cancer cells than chemical ones. Results
      suggest that BSeNPs are a good choice of selection as anticancer agents.

      (ACOSOG Z0011) trial were first reported in 2005 with a median follow-up of 6.3
      years. Longer follow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had
      estrogen receptor–positive tumors that may recur later in the disease course (the
      ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology). OBJECTIVE:
      To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph
      node metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node
      dissection (SLND) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is
      noninferior to that of women treated with axillary dissection. DESIGN, SETTING,
      AND PARTICIPANTS: The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled
      patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites (both academic and community
      medical centers). The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the
      ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or
      T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel
      lymph nodes containing metastases. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had planned
      lumpectomy, planned tangential whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic
      therapy. Third-field radiation was prohibited. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The
      primary outcome was overall survival with a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR)
      margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was disease-free survival. RESULTS: Among
      891 women who were randomized (median age, 55 years), 856 (96%) completed the
      trial (446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group). At a median
      follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range, 6.93–10.34 years), the 10-year
      overall survival was 86.3% in the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group
      (HR, 0.85 [1-sided 95%CI, 0–1.16]; noninferiority P = .02). The 10-year
      disease-free survival was 80.2% in the SLND alone group and 78.2% in the ALND
      group (HR, 0.85 [95%CI, 0.62–1.17]; P = .32). Between year 5 and year 10, 1
      regional recurrence was seen in the SLND alone group vs none in the ALND group.
      Ten-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast
      cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes
      containing metastases, 10-year overall survival for patients treated with
      sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall survival for
      those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. These findings do not support 
      routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population based on
      10-year outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00003855

TI  - The early onset of peripheral neuropathy might be a robust predictor for time to 
      treatment failure in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving
      chemotherapy containing paclitaxel.
LID - e0184322
AB  - Background: Paclitaxel plays a central role in chemotherapy for breast cancer.
      Peripheral neuropathy, a well-known toxicity with paclitaxel, may be of interest 
      in predicting the efficacy of paclitaxel therapy for patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. We performed a retrospective analysis assessing whether the early 
      occurrence of peripheral neuropathy (EPN) was a predictive marker for better
      efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy
      containing paclitaxel. Patients and methods: Between January 2000 and August
      2008, we examined the records of 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer
      treated with paclitaxel in our hospital. EPN was defined as a symptom of Grade 2 
      or more during first three months of treatment. The overall response rate (ORR)
      and time to treatment failure (TTF) in each group were analyzed retrospectively. 
      Results: Of 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with
      paclitaxel, EPN was documented in 101 patients (60.1%). The clinical benefit rate
      (CR, PR, and SD ≥ 6 months) was 72.3% in the EPN group and 49.3% in the non-EPN
      group (p = 0.002). The TTF of the EPN group (median 11.2 months, 95% CI:
      9.5–12.9) was significantly longer than that of the non-EPN group (5.7 months,
      95% CI: 4.6–6.8) (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that EPN
      (p<0.001), dose intensity of less than 70% (p<0.001), and the history of
      microtubule agents (p = 0.001) were the significant favorable prognostic factors 
      for TTF. Conclusion: The early onset of peripheral neuropathy might be a robust
      predictor for TTF in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with
      paclitaxel.

TI  - Iron imaging reveals tumor and metastasis macrophage hemosiderin deposits in
      breast cancer.
LID - e0184765
AB  - Iron-deposition is a metabolic biomarker of macrophages in both normal and
      pathological situations, but the presence of iron in tumor and
      metastasis-associated macrophages is not known. Here we mapped and quantified
      hemosiderin-laden macrophage (HLM) deposits in murine models of metastatic breast
      cancer using iron and macrophage histology, and in vivo MRI. Iron MRI detected
      high-iron pixel clusters in mammary tumors, lung metastasis, and brain metastasis
      as well as liver and spleen tissue known to contain the HLMs. Iron histology
      showed these regions to contain clustered macrophages identified by their common 
      iron status and tissue-intrinsic association with other phenotypic macrophage
      markers. The in vivo MRI and ex vivo histological images were further processed
      to determine the frequencies and sizes of the iron deposits, and measure the
      number of HLMs in each deposit to estimate the in vivo MRI sensitivity for these 
      cells. Hemosiderin accumulation is a macrophage biomarker and intrinsic contrast 
      source for cellular MRI associated with the innate function of macrophages in
      iron metabolism systemically, and in metastatic cancer.

TI  - Cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effects of new ruthenium complexes on triple negative
      breast cancer cells.
LID - e0183275
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer
      subtype. The high rate of metastasis associated to the fact that these cells
      frequently display multidrug resistance, make the treatment of metastatic disease
      difficult. Development of antitumor metal-based drugs was started with the
      discovery of cisplatin, however, the severe side effects represent a limitation
      for its clinical use. Ruthenium (Ru) complexes with different ligands have been
      successfully studied as prospective antitumor drugs. In this work, we
      demonstrated the activity of a series of biphosphine bipyridine Ru complexes (1) 
      [Ru(SO4)(dppb)(bipy)], (2) [Ru(CO3)(dppb)(bipy)], (3) [Ru(C2O4)(dppb)(bipy)] and 
      (4) [Ru(CH3CO2)(dppb)(bipy)]PF6 [where dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane
      and bipy = 2,2’-bipyridine], on proliferation of TNBC (MDA-MB-231),
      estrogen-dependent breast tumor cells (MCF-7) and a non-tumor breast cell line
      (MCF-10A). Complex (4) was most effective among the complexes and was selected to
      be further investigated on effects on tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion
      and in apoptosis. Moreover, DNA and HSA binding properties of this complex were
      also investigated. Results show that complex (4) was more efficient inhibiting
      proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells over non-tumor cells. In addition, complex (4) 
      was able to inhibit MDA-MB231 cells adhesion, migration and invasion and to
      induce apoptosis and inhibit MMP-9 secretion in TNBC cells. Complex (4) should be
      further investigated in vivo in order to stablish its potential to improve breast
      cancer treatment.

TI  - Collective invasion in ductal and lobular breast cancer associates with distant
      metastasis.
PG  - 421-9
AB  - Breast cancer undergoes collective tissue invasion and, in experimental models,
      can collectively metastasize. The prevalence of collective invasion and its
      contribution to distant metastasis in clinical disease, however, remains poorly
      defined. We here scored the adipose tissue invasion of primary invasive ductal
      carcinoma (IDC), expressing E-cadherin, and E-cadherin negative invasive lobular 
      carcinoma (ILC) and identified predominantly collective invasion patterns (86/86 
      samples) in both carcinoma types. Whereas collective invasion in IDC lesions
      retained adherens junctions, multicellular clusters and “Indian files” in ILC,
      despite the absence of adherens junctions (AJ) proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin,
      retained CD44 at cell–cell contacts. By histomorphological scoring and
      semi-automated image analysis, we show that the extent of collective invasion
      into the adipose tissue correlated with decreased distant metastasis-free
      survival (5-year follow-up; hazard ratio: 2.32 and 2.29, respectively). Thus,
      collective invasion represents the predominant invasion mode in breast cancer,
      develops distinct junctional subtypes in IDC and ILC, and associates with distant
      metastasis, suggesting a critical role in systemic dissemination.Electronic

TI  - High Concordance of a Closed-System, RT-qPCR Breast Cancer Assay for HER2 mRNA,
      Compared to Clinically Determined Immunohistochemistry, Fluorescence in situ
      Hybridization, and Quantitative Immunofluorescence.
PG  - 1521-6
AB  - Background: Historically, mRNA measurements have been tested on several
      commercially available platforms, but none have gained broad acceptance for
      assessment of HER2. An mRNA measurement, as a continuous value, has the potential
      for use in adjudication of the equivocal category. Here we use a real-time
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay in a
      closed, single-use cartridge, automated system. Methods: Multiple cores (1mm in
      diameter) were retrospectively collected from 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
      (FFPE) tissue blocks with invasive breast cancer seen by Yale Pathology Labs
      between 1998 and 2011. Tissue cores were processed with a FFPE lysis kit to
      create lysates that were tested with the automated RT-qPCR assay. Results for IHC
      and FISH were extracted from the pathology reports and quantitative
      immunofluorescence (QIF) for each case was measured as previously described.
      Results: Quality control testing showed that the GX platform RT-qPCR shows no
      case to case cross contamination on material from routine histology practices.
      Concordance between RT-qPCR and IHC/FISH was 91.25% (sensitivity = 0.87;
      specificity = 0.94; PPV = 0.89; NPV = 0.92) using a pre-defined delta Ct cut-off 
      (dCt ≥ −1) for HER2. Concordance (OPA) between RT-qPCR and QIF was 94%
      (sensitivity = 0.90; specificity = 0.96; PPV = 0.93; NPV = 0.94) using dCt ≥ −1
      and a previously defined cut-point for positivity by QIF. Conclusions: The closed
      system RT-qPCR assay shows greater than 90% concordance with the ASCO/CAP HER2
      IHC/FISH scoring. Additionally, the RT-qPCR assay is highly concordant (94%) with
      the continuous variable HER2 QIF assay, and may better reflect the true continuum
      of HER2 receptor status in invasive breast cancer. These initial results suggest 
      that fast, closed system molecular assays may have future value for the
      adjudication of the ASCO/CAP HER2 equivocal category or possibly routine usage in
      time constrained or low resource settings.

TI  - Validation of the 18-gene classifier as a prognostic biomarker of distant
      metastasis in breast cancer.
LID - e0184372
AB  - We validated an 18-gene classifier (GC) initially developed to predict
      local/regional recurrence after mastectomy in estimating distant metastasis risk.
      The 18-gene scoring algorithm defines scores as: <21, low risk; ≥21, high risk.
      Six hundred eighty-three patients with primary operable breast cancer and fresh
      frozen tumor tissues available were included. The primary outcome was the 5-year 
      probability of freedom from distant metastasis (DMFP). Two external datasets were
      used to test the predictive accuracy of 18-GC. The 5-year rates of DMFP for
      patients classified as low-risk (n = 146, 21.7%) and high-risk (n = 537, 78.6%)
      were 96.2% (95% CI, 91.1%–98.8%) and 80.9% (74.6%–81.9%), respectively (median
      follow-up interval, 71.8 months). The 5-year rates of DMFP of the low-risk group 
      in stage I (n = 62, 35.6%), stage II (n = 66, 20.1%), and stage III (n = 18,
      10.3%) were 100%, 94.2% (78.5%–98.5%), and 90.9% (50.8%–98.7%), respectively.
      Multivariate analysis revealed that 18-GC is an independent prognostic factor of 
      distant metastasis (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8–14.1; p = 0.0017) for
      scores of ≥21. External validation showed that the 5-year rate of DMFP in the
      low- and high-risk patients was 94.1% (82.9%–100%) and 80.3% (70.7%–89.9%, p =
      0.06) in a Singapore dataset, and 89.5% (81.9%–94.1%) and 73.6% (67.2%–79.0%, p =
      0.0039) in the GEO-GSE20685 dataset, respectively. In conclusion, 18-GC is a
      viable prognostic biomarker for breast cancer to estimate distant metastasis
      risk.

TI  - Comparison of risk classification between EndoPredict and MammaPrint in
      ER-positive/HER2-negative primary invasive breast cancer.
LID - e0183452
AB  - Purpose: To compare the concordance in risk classification between the
      EndoPredict and the MammaPrint scores obtained for the same cancer samples on 40 
      estrogen-receptor positive/HER2-negative breast carcinomas. Methods:
      Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded invasive breast carcinoma tissues that were
      previously analyzed with MammaPrint as part of routine care of the patients, and 
      were classified as high-risk (20 patients) and low-risk (20 patients), were
      selected to be analyzed by the EndoPredict assay, a second generation gene
      expression test that combines expression of 8 genes (EP score) with two
      clinicopathological variables (tumor size and nodal status, EPclin score).
      Results: The EP score classified 15 patients as low-risk and 25 patients as
      high-risk. EPclin re-classified 5 of the 25 EP high-risk patients into low-risk, 
      resulting in a total of 20 high-risk and 20 low-risk tumors. EP score and
      MammaPrint score were significantly correlated (p = 0.008). Twelve of 20 samples 
      classified as low-risk by MammaPrint were also low-risk by EP score (60%). 17 of 
      20 MammaPrint high-risk tumors were also high-risk by EP score. The overall
      concordance between EP score and MammaPrint was 72.5% (κ = 0.45, (95% CI, 0.182
      to 0.718)). EPclin score also correlated with MammaPrint results (p = 0.004).
      Discrepancies between both tests occurred in 10 cases: 5 MammaPrint low-risk
      patients were classified as EPclin high-risk and 5 high-risk MammaPrint were
      classified as low-risk by EPclin and overall concordance of 75% (κ = 0.5, (95%
      CI, 0.232 to 0.768)). Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates a limited
      concordance between MammaPrint and EndoPredict. Differences in results could be
      explained by the inclusion of different gene sets in each platform, the use of
      different methodology, and the inclusion of clinicopathological parameters, such 
      as tumor size and nodal status, in the EndoPredict test.

TI  - Lower frequency of TLR9 variant associated with protection from breast cancer
      among African Americans.
LID - e0183832
AB  - Introduction: Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an innate immune system DNA-receptor
      that regulates tumor invasion and immunity in vitro. Low tumor TLR9 expression
      has been associated with poor survival in Caucasian patients with triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC). African American (AA) patients with TNBC have worse
      prognosis than Caucasians but whether this is due to differences in tumor biology
      remains controversial. We studied the prognostic significance of tumor Toll like 
      receptor-9 (TLR9) protein expression among African American (AA) triple negative 
      breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Germline TLR9 variants in European Americans (EAs)
      and AAs were investigated, to determine their contribution to AA breast cancer
      risk. Methods: TLR9 expression was studied with immunohistochemistry in archival 
      tumors. Exome Variant Server and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to determine
      the genetic variation in the general EA and AA populations, and AA breast cancer 
      cases. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were compared between EAs (n = 4300), AAs 
      (n = 2203), and/or AA breast cancer cases (n = 131). Results: Thirty-two TLR9
      variants had a statistically significant MAF difference between general EAs and
      AAs. Twenty-one of them affect a CpG site. Rs352140, a variant previously
      associated with protection from breast cancer, is more common in EAs than AAs (p 
      = 2.20E-16). EAs had more synonymous alleles, while AAs had more rare coding
      alleles. Similar analyses comparing AA breast cancer cases with AA controls did
      not reveal any variant class differences; however, three previously unreported
      TLR9 variants were associated with late onset breast cancer. Although not
      statistically significant, rs352140 was observed less frequently in AA cases
      compared to controls. Tumor TLR9 protein expression was not associated with
      prognosis. Conclusions: Tumor TLR9 expression is not associated with prognosis in
      AA TNBC. Significant differences were detected in TLR9 variant MAFs between EAs
      and AAs. They may affect TLR9 expression and function. Rs352140, which may
      protect from breast cancer, is 1.6 X more common among EAs. These findings call
      for a detailed analysis of the contribution of TLR9 to breast cancer
      pathophysiology and health disparities.

TI  - Loss of Kaiso expression in breast cancer cells prevents intra-vascular invasion 
      in the lung and secondary metastasis.
LID - e0183883
AB  - The metastatic activity of breast carcinomas results from complex genetic changes
      in epithelial tumor cells and accounts for 90% of deaths in affected patients.
      Although the invasion of the local lymphatic vessels and veins by malignant
      breast tumor cells and their subsequent metastasis to the lung, has been
      recognized, the mechanisms behind the metastatic activity of breast tumor cells
      to other distal organs and the pathogenesis of metastatic cancer are not well
      understood. In this study, we utilized derivatives of the well-established and
      highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231
      (MDA-231) to study breast tumor metastasis in a mouse model. These MDA-231
      derivatives had depleted expression of Kaiso, a POZ-ZF transcription factor that 
      is highly expressed in malignant, triple negative breast cancers. We previously
      reported that Kaiso depletion attenuates the metastasis of xenografted MDA-231
      cells. Herein, we describe the pathological features of the metastatic activity
      of parental (Kaisopositive) versus Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells. Both
      Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells metastasized from the original
      tumor in the mammary fat pad to the lung. However, while Kaisopositive cells
      formed large masses in the lung parenchyma, invaded large pulmonary blood vessels
      and formed secondary metastases and large tumors in the distal organs,
      Kaisodepleted cells metastasized only to the lung where they formed small
      metastatic lesions. Importantly, intravascular invasion and secondary metastases 
      in distal organs were not observed in mice xenografted with Kaisodepleted cells. 
      It thus appears that the lung may constitute a barrier for less invasive breast
      tumors such as the Kaisodepleted TNBC cells; this barrier may limit tumor growth 
      and prevents Kaisodepleted TNBC cells from invading the pulmonary blood vessels
      and forming secondary metastases in distal organs.

TI  - Decision impact and feasibility of different ASCO-recommended biomarkers in early
      breast cancer: Prospective comparison of molecular marker EndoPredict and protein
      marker uPA/PAI-1.
LID - e0183917
AB  - Background: Adjuvant therapy decisions in early breast cancer are based on
      accurate risk assessment. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plaminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) have been the first biomarkers in hormone receptor 
      (HR) positive breast cancer to reach highest level of evidence. The EndoPredict
      test (EPclin) combines gene expression information with nodal status and tumor
      size. The aim of this prospective study was to compare uPA/PAI-1 and EPclin as
      prognostic biomarkers with regard to feasibility, risk stratification and impact 
      on adjuvant therapy recommendation. Materials and method: 395 patients with HR
      positive, HER2 negative, intermediate risk breast cancer were enrolled. Relations
      and concordance of histologic grading as well as EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 values were
      assessed by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and Cohen’s Kappa. To compare
      decision impact of EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 three independent case discussions were
      held: One with known uPA/PAI-1 and EPclin results, one blinded to EPclin alone
      and another one blinded to both EPclin and uPA/PAI-1. Results: EPclin could be
      determined in all 395 (100%), uPA/PAI-1 in 190 (48%) of the tumor samples. EPclin
      allocated 250 patients (63%) to the low-risk group and 145 patients (37%) to the 
      high-risk group, whereas uPA/PAI-1 allocated 88 patients (46%) to the low-risk
      group and 102 patients (54%) to the high-risk group. In 59% of cases, both tests 
      showed concordant results. EPclin resulted more frequently in a change of therapy
      recommendation than the uPA/PAI-1 test (46% vs 24%). Recommendation of adjuvant
      chemotherapy (CTX) was abandoned twice as often by EPclin (45%) compared to
      uPA/PAI-1 (22%). Conclusion: In this first prospective comparison of EPclin and
      uPA/PAI-1 we found, that EPclin is superior to uPA/PAI-1 with respect to
      feasibility and decision impact. This leads to substantial avoidance of adjuvant 
      CTX in endocrine-sensitive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Data collection for
      patients´ clinical outcome is ongoing.

TI  - Are online prediction tools a valid alternative to genomic profiling in the
      context of systemic treatment of ER-positive breast cancer?
LID - 20
AB  - Background: Clinicians use clinical and pathological parameters, such as tumour
      size, grade and nodal status, to make decisions on adjuvant treatments for breast
      cancer. However, therapeutic decisions based on these features tend to vary due
      to their subjectivity. Computational and mathematical algorithms were developed
      using clinical outcome data from breast cancer registries, such as Adjuvant!
      Online and NHS PREDICT. More recently, assessments of molecular profiles have
      been applied in the development of better prognostic tools. Methods: Based on the
      available literature on online registry-based tools and genomic assays, we
      evaluated whether these online tools could be valid and accurate alternatives to 
      genomic and molecular profiling of the individual breast tumour in aiding
      therapeutic decisions, particularly in patients with early ER-positive breast
      cancer. Results and conclusions: Early breast cancer is currently considered a
      systemic disease and a complex ecosystem with behaviour determined by the complex
      genetic and molecular signatures of the tumour cells, mammary stem cells,
      microenvironment and host immune system. We anticipate that molecular profiling
      will continue to evolve, expanding beyond the primary tumour to include the
      tumour microenvironment, cancer stem cells and host immune system. This should
      further refine therapeutic decisions and optimise clinical outcome.This article
      was specially invited by the editors and represents work by leading researchers.

TI  - BRCA1 protein expression and subcellular localization in primary breast cancer:
      Automated digital microscopy analysis of tissue microarrays.
LID - e0184385
AB  - Purpose: Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with familial as well as sporadic
      aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, but less is known about whether BRCA1
      expression or subcellular localization contributes to progression in
      population-based settings. Methods: We examined BRCA1 expression and subcellular 
      localization in invasive breast cancer tissues from an ethnically diverse sample 
      of 286 patients and 36 normal breast tissue controls. Two different methods were 
      used to label breast cancer tissues for BRCA1: (1) Dual immunofluoresent staining
      with BRCA1 and cytokeratin 8/18 and (2) immunohistochemical staining using the
      previously validated MS110 mouse monoclonal antibody. Slides were visualized and 
      quantified using the VECTRA Automated Multispectral Image Analysis System and
      InForm software. Results: BRCA1 staining was more intense in normal than in
      invasive breast tissue for both cytoplasmic (p<0.0001) and nuclear (p<0.01)
      compartments. BRCA1 nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio was higher in breast cancer
      cells than in normal mammary epithelial cells. Reduced BRCA1 expression was
      associated with high tumor grade and negative hormone receptors (estrogen
      receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2). On the other hand, high BRCA1
      expression correlated with basal-like tumors (high CK5/6 and EGFR), and high
      nuclear androgen receptor staining. Lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of BRCA1
      correlated significantly with high Ki67 labeling index (p< 0.05) and family
      history of breast cancer (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate
      that alterations in BRCA1 protein expression and subcellular localization in
      breast cancer correlate with poor prognostic markers and aggressive tumor
      features. Further large-scale studies are required to assess the potential
      relevance of BRCA1 protein expression and localization in routine classification

TI  - Diagnostic PET Imaging of Mammary Microcalcifications Using 64Cu-DOTA-Alendronate
      in a Rat Model of Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1373-9
AB  - The development of improved breast cancer screening methods is hindered by a lack
      of cancer-specific imaging agents and effective small-animal models to test them.
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate as a mammary
      microcalcification-targeting PET imaging agent, using an ideal rat model. Our
      long-term goal is to develop 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate for the detection and
      noninvasive differentiation of malignant versus benign breast tumors with PET.
      Methods: DOTA-alendronate was synthesized, radiolabeled with 64Cu, and
      administered to normal or tumor-bearing aged, female, retired breeder
      Sprague–Dawley rats for PET imaging. Mammary tissues were subsequently labeled
      and imaged with light, confocal, and electron microscopy to verify
      microcalcification targeting specificity of DOTA-alendronate and elucidate the
      histologic and ultrastructural characteristics of the microcalcifications in
      different mammary tumor types. Tumor uptake, biodistribution, and dosimetry
      studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      64Cu-DOTA-alendronate. Results:64Cu-DOTA-alendronate was radiolabeled with a 98% 
      yield. PET imaging using aged, female, retired breeder rats showed specific
      binding of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in mammary glands and mammary tumors. The
      highest uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate was in malignant tumors and the lowest
      uptake in benign tumors and normal mammary tissue. Confocal analysis with
      carboxyfluorescein-alendronate confirmed the microcalcification binding
      specificity of alendronate derivatives. Biodistribution studies revealed tissue
      alendronate concentrations peaking within the first hour, then decreasing over
      the next 48 h. Our dosimetric analysis demonstrated a 64Cu effective dose within 
      the acceptable range for clinical PET imaging agents and the potential for
      translation into human patients. Conclusion:64Cu-DOTA-alendronate is a promising 
      PET imaging agent for the sensitive and specific detection of mammary tumors as
      well as the differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors based on absolute
      labeling uptake.

TI  - MammaPrint versus EndoPredict: Poor correlation in disease recurrence risk
      classification of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
LID - e0183458
AB  - Introduction: Correct risk assessment of disease recurrence in patients with
      early breast cancer is critically important to detect patients who may be spared 
      adjuvant chemotherapy. In clinical practice this is increasingly done based on
      the results of gene expression assays. In the present study we compared the
      concordance of the 70-gene signature MammaPrint (MP) with the 12 gene assay
      EndoPredict (EP). Methods: Representative tissue of 48 primary tumours was
      analysed with the MP during routine diagnostic purposes. Corresponding
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was thereafter analysed by the EP test. 
      Risk categories of both tests were compared. Results: 41 of 48 tumours could be
      directly compared by both tests. Of the 17 MP low risk cases, only 9 were
      considered low risk by EP (53% agreement) and of the 24 MP high risk cases, 18
      were high risk by EP (75% agreement). Discrepancies occurred in 14 of 41 cases
      (34.1%). There was only a weak and non-significant correlation between the MP and
      EP test with an overall concordance of only 66%. The original therapeutic
      recommendation was based on the MP and would have been changed in 38% of the
      patients following EP test results. 4 patients developed distant metastases. The 
      respective tumours of these patients were all classified as high risk by the EP, 
      but only 3 were classified as high risk by the MP. Conclusion: Both tests
      resulted in different treatment recommendations for a significant proportion of
      patients and cannot be used interchangeably. The results underscore the urgent
      need for further comparative analyses of multi-genomic tests to avoid
      misclassification of disease recurrence risk in breast cancer patients.

TI  - The Impact of Treatment Preferences in Second-Line Chemotherapy on the Prognosis 
      of HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - Objective: We assessed the impact of treatment preferences in second-line
      chemotherapy on breast cancer prognosis using the SELECT BC study. Methods: The
      SELECT BC study was performed in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer treated with initial chemotherapy. From these patients, 618 were assigned 
      to 2 groups (S-1 group, 309; taxane group, 309). The S-1 and taxane groups were
      each subdivided into 3 groups: crossover group, protocol-recommended group, and
      other group, and the analysis of overall survival (OS) was performed using Cox
      regression with inverse probability weighting, to adjust for postrandomization
      confounding. Results: In the taxane group, the OS of the crossover group (39.6
      months) was better than that of the protocol-recommended group (35.7 months) and 
      the other chemotherapy group (36.9 months) (vs. the protocol-recommended group,
      HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.52–0.98], p = 0.037; vs. the other chemotherapy group, HR 0.71 
      [95% CI 0.43–1.18], p = 0.183). In the S-1 group, there was no statistically
      significant difference in OS between the 3 groups. Conclusion: The study of the
      combination of first-line chemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy showed that
      S-1 might be recommended as a second-line chemotherapy in patients in whom taxane
      was the primary chemotherapy.

TI  - Long non‐coding RNA CRALA is associated with poor response to chemotherapy in
      primary breast cancer.
PG  - 582-91
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, and has
      become the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide.
      Chemoresistance has become an important problem in breast cancer clinics. The
      identification of new mechanisms affecting chemosensitivity is of great clinical 
      value for the treatment of breast cancer. Methods: The expression levels of
      chemoresistance‐associated long non‐coding RNA (CRALA), a newly discovered long
      non‐coding RNA, were measured by quantitative real time‐PCR in 79 pre‐treatment
      biopsied primary breast cancer samples. Small interfering RNAs were used to
      knockdown CRALA expression. The effect of CRALA on chemosensitivity was evaluated
      using cell growth assay. Results: Non‐responding tumors (poor response to
      chemotherapy, 32 samples) had fourfold higher CRALA expression than responding
      tumors (good response to chemotherapy, 47 samples). CRALA is upregulated in
      chemoresistant breast cancer cell lines compared to their parental lines.
      Silencing of CRALA in chemoresistant breast cancer cells resensitizes the cells
      to chemotherapy in vitro. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analysis
      showed that higher CRALA expression was significantly associated with poor
      prognosis in 144 breast cancer patients. Conclusion: The study findings indicate 
      that CRALA expression may be an important biomarker for predicting the clinical
      response to chemotherapy and prognosis in breast cancer patients. It is possible 
      to target CRALA to reverse chemoresistance in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Recurrent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues contain a higher amount of
      phosphatidylcholine (32:1) than non-recurrent TNBC tissues.
LID - e0183724
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the breast cancer subtype that
      displays a high risk of early recurrence and short overall survival. Improvement 
      of the prognosis of patients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor
      of recurrence, which would make it possible to provide beneficial personalized
      treatment. However, no clinically reliable predictive factor is currently known. 
      In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using 
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid
      profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with
      recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for
      phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the
      recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was 
      more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding
      stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant
      transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor
      of TNBC recurrence. A future prospective study investigating whether personalized
      therapy based on PC (32:1) intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC
      is recommended.

TI  - The impact of malignant nipple discharge cytology (NDc) in surgical management of
      breast cancer patients.
LID - e0182073
AB  - Background: The role of nipple discharge cytology (NDc) in the surgical
      management of breast cancer patients is unclear. We aimed: (i) to evaluate the
      effect of malignant NDc on the surgical approach to the nipple-areola complex,
      and (ii) to verify the association between malignant NDc and nipple malignancy.
      Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a case series of 139 patients with NDc who
      underwent breast surgery. The clinical and histological findings, types of
      surgery with emphasis on nipple-areola complex amputation, immunohistochemical
      phenotypes of the carcinomas and measurements of the tumor-nipple distance were
      recorded. Additionally, in patients who showed HER2-positive lesions on
      definitive surgery, we evaluated the HER2 immunocytochemistry of the NDc smears. 
      Results: Thirty-two malignant and 107 benign/borderline NDc diagnoses were
      identified. All 32 malignant-NDc cases were histologically confirmed as
      malignant. Thirty borderline/benign-NDc cases were histologically diagnosed as
      malignant (sensitivity 58%). The majority of the patients with malignant NDc were
      treated with nipple-areola complex amputations in both the mastectomy and
      conservative surgery groups (P<0.001, χ251.77). Nipple involvement was strongly
      associated with HER2-positive ductal carcinoma in-situ (P<0.001, χ211.98). HER2
      immunocytochemistry on the NDc revealed a 100% correlation with the
      immunocytochemistry performed on the surgical tissues. Conclusions: Malignant NDc
      influenced surgical management. The association of malignant NDc with nipple
      involvement is highly related to ductal carcinoma in-situ with HER2
      overexpression. In case of HER2 positive NDc, nipple-areola complex involvement
      is more likely than in HER2 negative cases.

TI  - Lymph node status have a prognostic impact in breast cancer patients with distant
      metastasis.
LID - e0182953
AB  - Background: The objective of this retrospective study was to determine whether
      lymph node metastasis has a prognostic impact on patients with stage IV breast
      cancer. Patients and methods: Seven thousand three hundred and seventy-nine
      patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2013 were
      identified. Kaplan-Meier estimate method was fitted to measure overall survival
      and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Cox proportional hazard analysis was 
      used to evaluate the association between N stage and BCSS after controlling
      variables such as other patient/tumor characteristics. Results: The primary site 
      of M1 tumors was mainly upper-outer quadrant and overlapping lesion of the
      breast. Patients with N1 disease had better overall survival and BCSS than did
      those without lymph node metastasis. The overall survival and BCSS of M1 patients
      with N3 disease were significantly lower than that of those with N0, N1 and N2
      disease, whereas patients with N2 and N0/N1 involvement showed no significant
      difference with survival. Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis
      was an important prognostic factor for M1 patients (N1 versus N0, hazard ratio
      [HR] = 0.902, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.825–0.986, p = 0.023; N3 versus N0,
      HR = 1.161, 95% CI: 1.055–1.276, p = 0.002). For M1 patients, age, race, marital 
      status, primary site, ER, PR and HER2 were the independent prognostic factors.
      Conclusions: The cohort study provides an insight into de novo stage IV breast
      cancer with lymph node metastasis. Our results indicated that accurate lymph node
      evaluation for stage IV patients is still necessary to obtain important
      prognostic information.
