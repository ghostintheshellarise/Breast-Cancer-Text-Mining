TI  - Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer, mimicking primary gastric
      cancer: A case report.
LID - e0258
AB  - Rationale:: Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer is relatively 
      rare, commonly presented among multiple metastases, several years after primary
      diagnosis of breast cancer. Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronously
      presented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastric
      cancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required. Patient
      concerns:: A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because of right
      breast mass and progressive dyspepsia. Diagnoses:: Invasive lobular carcinoma of 
      breast was diagnosed on core needle biopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse
      scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrum and diagnosed as poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronous double primary breast and gastric cancers
      were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical
      studies of selected antibodies, including those of estrogen receptors, gross
      cystic disease fluid protein-15, and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2,
      were studied. As a result, gastric lesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric
      cancer originating from breast. Interventions:: Right breast conserving surgery
      was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to
      relieve the patient's symptoms. Systemic chemotherapy with combined
      administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Outcomes:: Forty-one 
      months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoing the same therapy. No 
      recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast and evidence of a partial
      remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed on follow-up studies
      without new metastatic lesions. Lessons:: Clinical suspicion, repeat endoscopic
      biopsy, and detailed histological analysis, including immunohistochemistry, are
      necessary for diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer from the breast.

TI  - The prognostic value of circulating cell-free DNA in breast cancer: A
      meta-analysis.
LID - e0197
AB  - Background:: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma or serum by
      noninvasive procedures can serve as a “liquid biopsy” and has potential as a
      biomarker for the tumor burden and survival prediction of breast cancer (BC).
      However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The 
      aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and
      survival outcome. Methods:: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and
      Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic
      utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics,
      relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were
      extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the
      Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
      Results:: This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127
      patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations between
      cfDNA and OS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.83–3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR = 2.73, 95%
      CI, 2.04–3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in the
      studies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that the
      adjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83–3.51), which is close to the original HR.
      Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker in
      patients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source,
      detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area. Conclusions:: Our
      meta-analysis indicates that cfDNA is a strong predictive and prognostic marker
      in patients with BC.

TI  - Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first‐line treatment for advanced
      breast cancer: A Japanese phase II study.
PG  - 803-13
AB  - This single‐arm, open‐label, phase II study in 42 Japanese postmenopausal
      patients with estrogen receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2‐negative (ER+/HER2−) advanced breast cancer evaluated the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of first‐line palbociclib (125 mg once daily, 3 weeks on/1 week 
      off) coadministered with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily). Primary endpoint of
      investigator‐assessed 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) probability was
      75.0% (90% CI, 61.3%‐84.4%), far surpassing the 40% lower limit of the 90% CI
      supporting efficacy. Median duration of treatment was 438 days. Among secondary
      efficacy measures, median PFS was not reached (95% CI, 16.7: not estimable),
      17/42 patients (40.5%) had an objective response, 36/42 (85.7%) maintained
      disease control, and 27/42 (64.3%) remained in follow‐up. Median overall survival
      was not reached, and 1‐year survival probability was 92.9% (95% CI, 79.5%‐97.6%).
      Results of intensive pharmacokinetics in a subset of 6 patients showed
      palbociclib steady‐state mean area under the plasma concentration‐time curve over
      the dosing interval [τ] and mean maximum plasma concentration were 1979 ng·h/mL
      and 124.7 ng/mL, respectively. For day 15 plasma samples from cycles 1 and 2,
      geometric mean of the within‐patient mean trough concentration was 90.1 ng/mL.
      The most common treatment‐related adverse events were neutropenia (100%) and
      stomatitis (73.8%). There was 1 case of treatment‐related febrile neutropenia.
      Toxicities were generally tolerated and manageable by dose modifications and/or
      medical care. Efficacy and safety of first‐line palbociclib plus letrozole
      therapy is supported in Japanese postmenopausal patients with treatment‐naive
      ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer.

TI  - Ultrasound combined with fine needle aspiration cytology for the assessment of
      axillary lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer.
LID - e9855
AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine
      needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes 
      in patients with early stage breast cancer (BC) among the Chinese Han female
      population.Around 124 patients with early stage BC were included in this
      retrospective study. All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients with
      proven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B).
      In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5 hours prior
      to the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive
      value (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%,
      respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%,
      respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, and
      PPV between the 2 procedures (P < .05).The results of this study demonstrated
      that USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALND
      or SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.

TI  - Multiplatform plasma metabolic and lipid fingerprinting of breast cancer: A pilot
      control-case study in Colombian Hispanic women.
LID - e0190958
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease associated with metabolic
      reprogramming. The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from
      Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and
      lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint
      of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were
      combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and
      healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites
      were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid
      metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in
      metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts 
      in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could
      contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC 
      in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the
      up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of
      cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in
      breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic
      women, despite racial differences.

TI  - Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s
      disease prediction.
LID - e0192192
AB  - Wavelet Neural Networks are a combination of neural networks and wavelets and
      have been mostly used in the area of time-series prediction and control.
      Recently, Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop
      cancer prediction models. The present study proposes to use ensembles of
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks. The search for a high quality ensemble is
      directed by a fitness function that incorporates the accuracy of the classifiers 
      both independently and as part of the ensemble itself. The ensemble approach is
      tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets, one on Breast
      Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease, using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.
      Our experimental results show that, for the first dataset, the performance was
      similar to previous studies reported in literature. On the second dataset, the
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous 
      methods. The third dataset is relatively new and this study is the first to
      report benchmark results.

TI  - Evaluation of drug mechanism and efficacy of a novel anti-angiogenic agent,
      TTAC-0001, using multi-modality bioimaging in a mouse breast cancer orthotopic
      model.
LID - e0187063
AB  - Purpose: Targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) has
      potential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling
      regulator of VEGF/VEGFR pathways. We aimed to elucidate the drug mechanism and
      anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-0001, a novel, fully human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR
      monoclonal antibody, in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-modal
      bioimaging. Materials and methods: We used orthotopic xenograft tumor model in
      which human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected into the right mammary
      fat pad of Balb/c nude mice. We investigated its biodistribution using serial
      fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action
      using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was
      assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic
      analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with 
      anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four
      groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2
      group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group). Results: The TTAC-10 group showed
      good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good
      anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive 
      cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10
      group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as
      detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also
      showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index 
      in histopathologic analyses. Conclusion: We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001
      effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic
      breast cancer model. It may provide a future treatment option for breast cancer.

TI  - Menstrual and reproductive factors and risk of breast cancer: A case-control
      study in the Fez region, Morocco.
LID - e0191333
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. In the
      Moroccan context, the role of well-known reproductive factors in breast cancer
      remains poorly documented. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship 
      between menstrual and reproductive factors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan
      women in the Fez region. Methods: A case–control study was conducted at the
      Hassan II University Hospital of Fez between January 2014 and April 2015. A total
      of 237 cases of breast cancer and 237 age-matched controls were included.
      Information on sociodemographic characteristics, menstrual and reproductive
      history, family history of breast cancer, and lifestyle factors was obtained
      through a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were
      used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer by
      menstrual and reproductive factors adjusted for potential confounders. Results:
      Early menarche (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.38) and nulliparity (OR = 3.77, 95% CI:
      1.98–7.30) were significantly related to an increased risk of breast cancer,
      whereas an early age at first full-term pregnancy was associated with a decreased
      risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.65). Conclusion: The results of 
      this study confirm the role of established reproductive factors for breast cancer
      in Moroccan women. It identified some susceptible groups at high risk of breast
      cancer. Preventive interventions and screening should focus on these groups as a 
      priority. These results should be confirmed in a larger, multicenter study.

TI  - High nuclear MSK1 is associated with longer survival in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 509-17
AB  - Purpose: Mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSKs) are important substrates of
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase family. MSK1
      and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases, with MSK1 being
      suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation, cell
      cycle progression, cell migration, invasion and tumour growth. The aim of the
      current study was to assess MSK1 protein expression in breast cancer tumour
      specimens, evaluating its prognostic significance. Methods: A large cohort of
      1902 early stage invasive breast cancer patients was used to explore the
      expression of MSK1. Protein expression was examined using standard
      immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Results: Low MSK1 protein expression 
      was associated with younger age (P = 0.004), higher tumour grade (P < 0.001),
      higher Nottingham Prognostic Index scores (P = 0.007), negative ER (P < 0.001)
      and PR (P < 0.001) status, and with triple-negative (P < 0.001) and basal-like
      (P < 0.001) phenotypes. Low MSK1 protein expression was significantly associated 
      with shorter time to distant metastasis (P < 0.001), and recurrence (P = 0.013)
      and early death due to breast cancer (P = 0.01). This association between high
      MSK1 expression and improved breast cancer-specific survival was observed in the 
      whole cohort (P = 0.009) and in the HER2-negative and non-basal like tumours
      (P = 0.006 and P = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis including other
      prognostic variables indicated that MSK1 is not an independent marker of outcome.
      Conclusions: High MSK1 is associated with improved breast cancer-specific
      survival in early stage invasive breast cancer patients, and has additional
      prognostic value in HER2-negative and non-basal like disease. Although not an
      independent marker of outcome, we believe such findings and significant
      associations with well-established negative prognostic factors (age, grade,
      Nottingham Prognostic Index, hormone receptor status, time to distant metastasis,
      recurrence and triple-negative/basal-like status) warrant further examination and
      validation in independent patient cohorts.

TI  - Differential microRNA expression in breast cancer with different onset age.
LID - e0191195
AB  - Purpose: The lower breast cancer incidence in Asian populations compared with
      Western populations has been speculated to be caused by environmental and genetic
      variation. Early-onset breast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast
      cancers in Asian populations, but the reason for this is unclear. We aimed to
      examine miRNA expression profiles in different age-onset groups and pathological 
      subtypes in Asian breast cancer. Methods: At the first stage, 10 samples (tumor: 
      n = 6, normal tissue: n = 4) were analyzed with an Agilent microRNA 470 probe
      microarray. Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that were significantly
      altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review were
      further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 145 breast cancer
      samples at the second stage of the process. Correlations between
      clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients from different age
      groups and candidate miRNA expression were elucidated. Results: In the present
      study, the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group, and an 
      onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates. For all
      breast cancer patients, miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated, and miR-21,
      miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-141 were up-regulated. In very young patients (age < 
      35 y/o), the expression of 3 and 8 specific miRNAs were up- and down-regulated,
      respectively. In young patients (36–40 y/o), 3 and 3 specific miRNAs were up- and
      down-regulated, respectively. miR-532-5p was up-regulated in triple-negative
      breast cancer. Conclusions: Differential miRNA expressions between normal and
      tumor tissues were observed in different age groups and tumor subtypes.
      Evolutionarily conserved miRNA clusters, which initiate malignancy
      transformation, were up-regulated in the breast cancers of very young patients.
      None of the significantly altered miRNAs were observed in postmenopausal
      patients.
