TI  - Changes in ischemia-modified albumin in myocardial toxicity induced by
      anthracycline and docetaxel chemotherapy.
LID - e7681
AB  - This study aims to evaluate differences in myocardial toxicity induced by
      different chemotherapy regimens. Patients were divided into 2 groups: epirubicin 
      (EPI) combined with cyclophosphamide (EC) group and docetaxel combined with
      cyclophosphamide (TC) group. Changes in electrocardiograph (ECG) and
      ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) were determined pre- and 1, 3, and 6 courses of
      postchemotherapy. After the first course of chemotherapy, there was no
      significant difference in ECG and abnormal IMA incidence rates between the TC
      groups and EC groups (P > .05). After the third course and at the end of the
      sixth course, ECG and abnormal IMA incidence rates in the EC group were
      significantly higher than in the TC group (P < .05). Besides, IMA values
      significantly increased with the increase in chemotherapy courses in the EC
      group; and the value of the postsixth course was significantly higher than in the
      pre- and postfirst and -third courses of chemotherapy. IMA value in the postsixth
      course in the TC group was significantly higher than that in the pre- and
      postfirst and -third courses of chemotherapy. In addition, IMA values at the
      postfirst and -third courses of chemotherapy in the EC group were significantly
      higher than in the TC group. Both EC and TC chemotherapy regimens were harmful to
      the myocardium, and the incidence rate of myocardial damage increased with the
      increase of cumulative dose. Besides, the degree of myocardial damage in EC group
      was significantly higher than in the TC group.

TI  - Development of mammary hyperplasia, dysplasia, and invasive ductal carcinoma in
      transgenic mice expressing the 8p11 amplicon oncogene NSD3.
PG  - 349-58
AB  - Purpose: NSD3 has been implicated as a candidate driver oncogene from the
      8p11-p12 locus, and we have previously published evidence for its amplification
      and overexpression in human breast cancer. This aim of this study was to further 
      characterize the transforming function of NSD3 in vivo. Methods: We generated a
      transgenic mouse model in which NSD3 gene expression was driven by the MMTV
      promoter and expressed in mammary epithelium of FVB mice. Mammary glands were
      fixed and whole mounts were stained with carmine to visualize gland structure.
      Mammary tumors were formalin-fixed, and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumors were
      stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Results: Pups born to transgenic females were
      significantly underdeveloped compared to pups born to WT females due to a
      lactation defect in transgenic female mice. Whole mount analysis of the mammary
      glands of transgenic female mice revealed a profound defect in functional
      differentiation of mammary gland alveoli that resulted in the lactation defect.
      We followed parous and virgin NSD3 transgenic and control mice to 50 weeks of age
      and observed that several NSD3 parous females developed mammary tumors. Whole
      mount analysis of the mammary glands of tumor-bearing mice revealed numerous
      areas of mammary hyperplasia and ductal dysplasia. Histological analysis showed
      that mammary tumors were high-grade ductal carcinomas, and lesions present in
      other mammary glands exhibited features of alveolar hyperplasia, ductal
      dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with
      our previous studies and demonstrate that NSD3 is a transforming breast cancer
      oncogene.

TI  - BRCA Genetic Testing and Receipt of Preventive Interventions Among Women Aged
      18–64 Years with Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance in Nonmetropolitan and
      Metropolitan Areas — United States, 2009–2014.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Problem/Condition: Genetic testing for breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 
      2 (BRCA2) gene mutations can identify women at increased risk for breast and
      ovarian cancer. These testing results can be used to select preventive
      interventions and guide treatment. Differences between nonmetropolitan and
      metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive
      interventions after testing have not previously been examined. Period Covered:
      2009–2014. Description of System: Medical claims data from Truven Health
      Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases were used to
      estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA
      testing among women aged 18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance in 
      metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States, both nationally and 
      regionally. Results: From 2009 to 2014, BRCA testing rates per 100,000 women aged
      18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance increased 2.3 times (102.7
      to 237.8) in metropolitan areas and 3.0 times (64.8 to 191.3) in nonmetropolitan 
      areas. The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and
      nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37% in 2009 (102.7 versus 64.8) to 20% in
      2014 (237.8 versus 191.3). The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between 
      metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased more over time in younger women 
      than in older women and decreased in all regions except the West. Receipt of
      preventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus
      nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service: the percentage of 
      women who received a mastectomy was similar, the percentage of women who received
      magnetic resonance imaging of the breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas (as
      low as 5.8% in 2014 to as high as 8.2% in 2011) than metropolitan areas (as low
      as 7.3% in 2014 to as high as 10.3% in 2011), and the percentage of women who
      received mammography was lower in nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was 
      similar in later years. Interpretation: Possible explanations for the 47%
      decrease in the relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the study period
      include increased access to genetic services in nonmetropolitan areas and
      increased demand nationally as a result of publicity. The relative differences in
      metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were smaller among women at
      younger ages compared with older ages. Public Health Action: Improved data
      sources and surveillance tools are needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA
      testing in the United States, monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for 
      BRCA testing, and assess receipt of preventive interventions for women with BRCA 
      mutations. Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic disparities in
      receipt of BRCA testing while simultaneously educating the public and health care
      providers about U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations and other
      clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and counseling.

TI  - Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer, mimicking primary gastric
      cancer: A case report.
LID - e0258
AB  - Rationale:: Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer is relatively 
      rare, commonly presented among multiple metastases, several years after primary
      diagnosis of breast cancer. Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronously
      presented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastric
      cancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required. Patient
      concerns:: A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because of right
      breast mass and progressive dyspepsia. Diagnoses:: Invasive lobular carcinoma of 
      breast was diagnosed on core needle biopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse
      scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrum and diagnosed as poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronous double primary breast and gastric cancers
      were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical
      studies of selected antibodies, including those of estrogen receptors, gross
      cystic disease fluid protein-15, and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2,
      were studied. As a result, gastric lesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric
      cancer originating from breast. Interventions:: Right breast conserving surgery
      was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to
      relieve the patient's symptoms. Systemic chemotherapy with combined
      administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Outcomes:: Forty-one 
      months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoing the same therapy. No 
      recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast and evidence of a partial
      remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed on follow-up studies
      without new metastatic lesions. Lessons:: Clinical suspicion, repeat endoscopic
      biopsy, and detailed histological analysis, including immunohistochemistry, are
      necessary for diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer from the breast.

TI  - The prognostic value of circulating cell-free DNA in breast cancer: A
      meta-analysis.
LID - e0197
AB  - Background:: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma or serum by
      noninvasive procedures can serve as a “liquid biopsy” and has potential as a
      biomarker for the tumor burden and survival prediction of breast cancer (BC).
      However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The 
      aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and
      survival outcome. Methods:: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and
      Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic
      utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics,
      relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were
      extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the
      Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
      Results:: This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127
      patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations between
      cfDNA and OS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.83–3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR = 2.73, 95%
      CI, 2.04–3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in the
      studies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that the
      adjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83–3.51), which is close to the original HR.
      Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker in
      patients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source,
      detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area. Conclusions:: Our
      meta-analysis indicates that cfDNA is a strong predictive and prognostic marker
      in patients with BC.

TI  - Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first‐line treatment for advanced
      breast cancer: A Japanese phase II study.
PG  - 803-13
AB  - This single‐arm, open‐label, phase II study in 42 Japanese postmenopausal
      patients with estrogen receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2‐negative (ER+/HER2−) advanced breast cancer evaluated the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of first‐line palbociclib (125 mg once daily, 3 weeks on/1 week 
      off) coadministered with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily). Primary endpoint of
      investigator‐assessed 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) probability was
      75.0% (90% CI, 61.3%‐84.4%), far surpassing the 40% lower limit of the 90% CI
      supporting efficacy. Median duration of treatment was 438 days. Among secondary
      efficacy measures, median PFS was not reached (95% CI, 16.7: not estimable),
      17/42 patients (40.5%) had an objective response, 36/42 (85.7%) maintained
      disease control, and 27/42 (64.3%) remained in follow‐up. Median overall survival
      was not reached, and 1‐year survival probability was 92.9% (95% CI, 79.5%‐97.6%).
      Results of intensive pharmacokinetics in a subset of 6 patients showed
      palbociclib steady‐state mean area under the plasma concentration‐time curve over
      the dosing interval [τ] and mean maximum plasma concentration were 1979 ng·h/mL
      and 124.7 ng/mL, respectively. For day 15 plasma samples from cycles 1 and 2,
      geometric mean of the within‐patient mean trough concentration was 90.1 ng/mL.
      The most common treatment‐related adverse events were neutropenia (100%) and
      stomatitis (73.8%). There was 1 case of treatment‐related febrile neutropenia.
      Toxicities were generally tolerated and manageable by dose modifications and/or
      medical care. Efficacy and safety of first‐line palbociclib plus letrozole
      therapy is supported in Japanese postmenopausal patients with treatment‐naive
      ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer.

TI  - Ultrasound combined with fine needle aspiration cytology for the assessment of
      axillary lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer.
LID - e9855
AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine
      needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes 
      in patients with early stage breast cancer (BC) among the Chinese Han female
      population.Around 124 patients with early stage BC were included in this
      retrospective study. All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients with
      proven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B).
      In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5 hours prior
      to the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive
      value (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%,
      respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%,
      respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, and
      PPV between the 2 procedures (P < .05).The results of this study demonstrated
      that USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALND
      or SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.

TI  - Multiplatform plasma metabolic and lipid fingerprinting of breast cancer: A pilot
      control-case study in Colombian Hispanic women.
LID - e0190958
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease associated with metabolic
      reprogramming. The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from
      Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and
      lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint
      of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were
      combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and
      healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites
      were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid
      metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in
      metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts 
      in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could
      contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC 
      in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the
      up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of
      cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in
      breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic
      women, despite racial differences.

TI  - Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s
      disease prediction.
LID - e0192192
AB  - Wavelet Neural Networks are a combination of neural networks and wavelets and
      have been mostly used in the area of time-series prediction and control.
      Recently, Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop
      cancer prediction models. The present study proposes to use ensembles of
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks. The search for a high quality ensemble is
      directed by a fitness function that incorporates the accuracy of the classifiers 
      both independently and as part of the ensemble itself. The ensemble approach is
      tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets, one on Breast
      Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease, using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.
      Our experimental results show that, for the first dataset, the performance was
      similar to previous studies reported in literature. On the second dataset, the
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous 
      methods. The third dataset is relatively new and this study is the first to
      report benchmark results.

TI  - Expansion of human γδ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy using a bisphosphonate
      prodrug.
PG  - 587-99
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy with human γδ T cells expressing Vγ2Vδ2 T cell receptor
      (also termed Vγ9Vδ2) has shown promise because of their ability to recognize and 
      kill most types of tumors in a major histocombatibility complex (MHC)
      ‐unrestricted fashion that is independent of the number of tumor mutations. In
      clinical trials, adoptive transfer of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells has been shown to be safe
      and does not require preconditioning. In this report, we describe a method for
      preparing highly enriched human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells using the bisphosphonate prodrug, 
      tetrakis‐pivaloyloxymethyl 2‐(thiazole‐2‐ylamino)ethylidene‐1,1‐bisphosphonate
      (PTA). PTA stimulated the expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 cells to purities up to 99%. These 
      levels were consistently higher than those observed after expansion with
      zoledronic acid, the most commonly used stimulator for clinical trials. Cell
      numbers also averaged more than those obtained with zoledronic acid and the
      expanded Vγ2Vδ2 cells exhibited high cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The high
      purity of Vγ2Vδ2 cells expanded by PTA increased engraftment success in
      immunodeficient NOG mice. Even low levels of contaminating αβ T cells resulted in
      some mice with circulating human αβ T cells rather than Vγ2Vδ2 cells. Vγ2Vδ2
      cells from engrafted NOG mice upregulated CD25 and secreted tumor necrosis
      factor‐α and interferon‐γ in response to PTA‐treated tumor cells. Thus, PTA
      expands Vγ2Vδ2 T cells to higher purity than zoledronic acid. The high purities
      allow the successful engraftment of immunodeficient mice without further
      purification and may speed up the development of allogeneic Vγ2Vδ2 T cell
      therapies derived from HLA‐matched normal donors for patients with poor
      autologous Vγ2Vδ2 T cell responses.

TI  - Postoperative outcomes of breast reconstruction after mastectomy: A retrospective
      study.
LID - e9766
AB  - Breast reconstruction after mastectomy plays an active role in improving the
      quality-of-life (QoL) and alleviating the psychological trauma of breast cancer
      patients, and has become an indispensable part of the comprehensive treatment in 
      breast cancer. However, compared with mastectomy alone, breast reconstruction
      also increase operative complications. The surgical, oncological outcomes, and
      cosmetic effect of breast reconstruction remains to be evaluated. Data for
      patients with breast cancer who underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
      from February 2009 to November 2015 in our hospital were retrospectively
      analyzed, with a median follow-up time of 44 months. The operating time, blood
      loss, drainage fluid, postoperative complications, postoperative cosmesis,
      oncological outcomes, and QoL were evaluated and compared between different
      reconstruction types. A total of 151 women were included. The flap-based group
      had higher complication rates of marginal necrosis of incision, while the
      incidence of capsular contracture was higher in immediate implant group. There
      was no difference in blood loss, drainage fluid, and other postoperative
      complications. Several independent factors were associated with increased
      postoperative complications included diabetic, obese, and reconstruction with
      flap. There was no significant difference in the disease-free survival rate and
      overall survival rate between different surgical groups. In terms of cosmetic
      effect, patients in the tissue expander group were more likely to get a
      satisfactory postoperative breast appearance. QoL outcomes shown that the tissue 
      expander group has better body image and sexual enjoyment, while there was no
      significant difference for other QoL domains. In conclusion, different methods of
      breast reconstruction are safe and feasible for patients with breast cancer,
      tissue expander implantation following delayed implant breast reconstruction is a
      more effective treatment on cosmetic and QoL outcomes.

TI  - Availability and accessibility of subsidized mammogram screening program in
      peninsular Malaysia: A preliminary study using travel impedance approach.
LID - e0191764
AB  - Access to healthcare is essential in the pursuit of universal health coverage.
      Components of access are availability, accessibility (spatial and non-spatial),
      affordability and acceptability. Measuring spatial accessibility is common
      approach to evaluating access to health care. This study aimed to determine the
      availability and spatial accessibility of subsidised mammogram screening in
      Peninsular Malaysia. Availability was determined from the number and distribution
      of facilities. Spatial accessibility was determined using the travel impedance
      approach to represent the revealed access as opposed to potential access measured
      by other spatial measurement methods. The driving distance of return trips from
      the respondent’s residence to the facilities was determined using a mapping
      application. The travel expenditure was estimated by multiplying the total travel
      distance by a standardised travel allowance rate, plus parking fees. Respondents 
      in this study were 344 breast cancer patients who received treatment at 4
      referral hospitals between 2015 and 2016. In terms of availability, there were at
      least 6 major entities which provided subsidised mammogram programs. Facilities
      with mammogram involved with these programs were located more densely in the
      central and west coast region of the Peninsula. The ratio of mammogram facility
      to the target population of women aged 40–74 years ranged between 1: 10,000 and
      1:80,000. In terms of accessibility, of the 3.6% of the respondents had undergone
      mammogram screening, their mean travel distance was 53.4 km (SD = 34.5, range
      8–112 km) and the mean travel expenditure was RM 38.97 (SD = 24.00, range
      RM7.60–78.40). Among those who did not go for mammogram screening, the estimated 
      travel distance and expenditure had a skewed distribution with median travel
      distance of 22.0 km (IQR 12.0, 42.0, range 2.0–340.0) and the median travel cost 
      of RM 17.40 (IQR 10.40, 30.00, range 3.40–240.00). Higher travel impedance was
      noted among those who lived in sub-urban and rural areas. In summary,
      availability of mammogram facilities was good in the central and west coast of
      the peninsula. The overall provider-to-population ratio was lower than
      recommended. Based on the travel impedance approach used, accessibility to
      subsidised mammogram screening among the respondents was good in urban areas but 
      deprived in other areas. This study was a preliminary study with limitations.
      Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that actions have to be taken to improve the
      accessibility to opportunistic mammogram screening in Malaysia in pursuit of
      universal health coverage.

TI  - Adipocyte/breast cancer cell crosstalk in obesity interferes with the
      anti-proliferative efficacy of tamoxifen.
LID - e0191571
AB  - Background: Obesity is a well-known risk factor of breast cancer in
      post-menopausal women that also correlates with a diminished therapeutic
      response. The influence of adipocytes and their secretome, i.e. adipokines, on
      the efficacy of hormone therapy has yet to be elucidated. Methods: We
      investigated, ex vivo, whether mature adipocytes, differentiated from adipose
      stem cells of normal-weight (MA20) or obese (MA30) women, and their secretions,
      were able to counteract the effects of tamoxifen (Tx) which is known to decrease 
      neoplastic cell proliferation. Results: In a tridimensional model and in a model 
      of co-culture, the anti-proliferative effect of Tx on MCF-7 cancer cells was
      counteracted by MA30. These two models highlighted two different specific gene
      expression profiles for genes encoding cytokines or involved in angiogenesis
      based on the adipocyte microenvironment and the treatment. Thus it notably showed
      altered expression of genes such as TNFα that correlated with IL-6. In addition, 
      leptin, IL-6 and TNFα, at concentrations reflecting plasma concentrations in
      obese patients, decreased the anti-proliferative efficacy of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
      (a major active metabolite of Tx). Conclusions: These findings bring insights on 
      adipocytes and mammary cancer cell interactions in Tx therapy, particularly in
      overweight/obese people. Indeed, patient’ adipokine status would give valuable
      information for developing individual strategies and avoid resistance to
      treatment.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of the utility of multiparametric MRI for differentiating 
      between benign and malignant breast lesions in women in China.
LID - e9666
AB  - We explored the utility of time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic 
      trajectories dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (TWIST
      DCE-MRI), readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging- diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (RESOLVE-DWI), and echo-planar imaging- diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
      imaging (EPI-DWI) for distinguishing between malignant and benign breast
      lesions.This retrospective analysis included female patients with breast lesions 
      seen at a single center in China between January 2016 and April 2016. Patients
      were allocated to a benign or malignant group based on pathologic diagnosis. All 
      patients received routine MRI, RESOLVE-DWI, EPI-DWI, and TWIST DCE-T1WI.
      Variables measured included quantitative parameters (Ktrans, Kep, and Ve),
      semiquantitative parameters (rate of contrast enhancement for contrast agent
      inflow [W-in], rate of contrast decay for contrast agent outflow [W-out], and
      time-to-peak enhancement after contrast agent injection [TTP]) and apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for RESOLVE-DWI (ADCr) and EPI-DWI (ADCe).
      Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the
      diagnostic utility of each parameter for differentiating malignant from benign
      breast lesions.A total of 87 patients were included (benign, n = 20; malignant,
      n = 67). Compared with the benign group, the malignant group had significantly
      higher Ktrans, Kep and W-in and significantly lower W-out, TTP, ADCe, and ADCr
      (all P < .05); Ve was not significantly different between groups. RESOLVE-DWI was
      superior to conventional EPI-DWI at illustrating lesion boundary and morphology, 
      while ADCr was significantly lower than ADCe in all patients. Kep, W-out, ADCr,
      and ADCe showed the highest diagnostic efficiency (based on AUC value) for
      differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Combining 3 parameters
      (Kep, W-out, and ADCr) had a higher diagnostic efficiency (AUC, 0.965) than any
      individual parameter and distinguished between benign and malignant lesions with 
      high sensitivity (91.0%), specificity (95.0%), and accuracy (91.9%).An index
      combining Kep, W-out, and ADCr could potentially be used for the differential
      diagnosis of breast lesions.

AB  - In silico methods of phenotypic screening are necessary to reduce the time and
      cost of the experimental in vivo screening of anticancer agents through dozens of
      millions of natural and synthetic chemical compounds. We used the previously
      developed PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) algorithm to
      create and validate the classification SAR models for predicting the cytotoxicity
      of chemicals against different types of human cell lines using ChEMBL
      experimental data. A training set from 59,882 structures of compounds was created
      based on the experimental data (IG50, IC50, and % inhibition values) from ChEMBL.
      The average accuracy of prediction (AUC) calculated by leave-one-out and a
      20-fold cross-validation procedure during the training was 0.930 and 0.927 for
      278 cancer cell lines, respectively, and 0.948 and 0.947 for cytotoxicity
      prediction for 27 normal cell lines, respectively. Using the given SAR models, we
      developed a freely available web-service for cell-line cytotoxicity profile
      prediction (CLC-Pred: Cell-Line Cytotoxicity Predictor) based on the following
      structural formula: http://way2drug.com/Cell-line/.

TI  - Evaluation of drug mechanism and efficacy of a novel anti-angiogenic agent,
      TTAC-0001, using multi-modality bioimaging in a mouse breast cancer orthotopic
      model.
LID - e0187063
AB  - Purpose: Targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) has
      potential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling
      regulator of VEGF/VEGFR pathways. We aimed to elucidate the drug mechanism and
      anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-0001, a novel, fully human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR
      monoclonal antibody, in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-modal
      bioimaging. Materials and methods: We used orthotopic xenograft tumor model in
      which human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected into the right mammary
      fat pad of Balb/c nude mice. We investigated its biodistribution using serial
      fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action
      using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was
      assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic
      analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with 
      anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four
      groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2
      group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group). Results: The TTAC-10 group showed
      good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good
      anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive 
      cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10
      group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as
      detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also
      showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index 
      in histopathologic analyses. Conclusion: We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001
      effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic
      breast cancer model. It may provide a future treatment option for breast cancer.

TI  - The correlation of background parenchymal enhancement in the contralateral breast
      with patient and tumor characteristics of MRI-screen detected breast cancers.
LID - e0191399
AB  - Purpose: Higher background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) could be used for
      stratification of MRI screening programs since it might be related to a higher
      breast cancer risk. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to correlate BPE to
      patient and tumor characteristics in women with unilateral MRI-screen detected
      breast cancer who participated in an intermediate and high risk screening
      program. As BPE in the affected breast may be difficult to discern from enhancing
      cancer, we assumed that BPE in the contralateral breast is a representative
      measure for BPE in women with unilateral breast cancer. Materials and methods:
      This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional board and a
      waiver for consent was granted. MR-examinations of women with unilateral breast
      cancers screen-detected on breast MRI were evaluated by two readers. BPE in the
      contralateral breast was rated according to BI-RADS. Univariate analyses were
      performed to study associations. Observer variability was computed. Results:
      Analysis included 77 breast cancers in 76 patients (age: 48±9.8 years), including
      62 invasive and 15 pure ductal carcinoma in-situ cases. A negative association
      between BPE and tumor grade (p≤0.016) and a positive association with
      progesterone status (p≤0.021) was found. The correlation was stronger when only
      considering invasive disease. Inter-reader agreement was substantial. Conclusion:
      Lower BPE in the contralateral breast in women with unilateral breast cancer
      might be associated to higher tumor grade and progesterone receptor negativity.
      Great care should be taken using BPE for stratification of patients to tailored
      screening programs.

TI  - Menstrual and reproductive factors and risk of breast cancer: A case-control
      study in the Fez region, Morocco.
LID - e0191333
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. In the
      Moroccan context, the role of well-known reproductive factors in breast cancer
      remains poorly documented. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship 
      between menstrual and reproductive factors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan
      women in the Fez region. Methods: A case–control study was conducted at the
      Hassan II University Hospital of Fez between January 2014 and April 2015. A total
      of 237 cases of breast cancer and 237 age-matched controls were included.
      Information on sociodemographic characteristics, menstrual and reproductive
      history, family history of breast cancer, and lifestyle factors was obtained
      through a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were
      used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer by
      menstrual and reproductive factors adjusted for potential confounders. Results:
      Early menarche (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.38) and nulliparity (OR = 3.77, 95% CI:
      1.98–7.30) were significantly related to an increased risk of breast cancer,
      whereas an early age at first full-term pregnancy was associated with a decreased
      risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.65). Conclusion: The results of 
      this study confirm the role of established reproductive factors for breast cancer
      in Moroccan women. It identified some susceptible groups at high risk of breast
      cancer. Preventive interventions and screening should focus on these groups as a 
      priority. These results should be confirmed in a larger, multicenter study.

TI  - High nuclear MSK1 is associated with longer survival in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 509-17
AB  - Purpose: Mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSKs) are important substrates of
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase family. MSK1
      and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases, with MSK1 being
      suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation, cell
      cycle progression, cell migration, invasion and tumour growth. The aim of the
      current study was to assess MSK1 protein expression in breast cancer tumour
      specimens, evaluating its prognostic significance. Methods: A large cohort of
      1902 early stage invasive breast cancer patients was used to explore the
      expression of MSK1. Protein expression was examined using standard
      immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Results: Low MSK1 protein expression 
      was associated with younger age (P = 0.004), higher tumour grade (P < 0.001),
      higher Nottingham Prognostic Index scores (P = 0.007), negative ER (P < 0.001)
      and PR (P < 0.001) status, and with triple-negative (P < 0.001) and basal-like
      (P < 0.001) phenotypes. Low MSK1 protein expression was significantly associated 
      with shorter time to distant metastasis (P < 0.001), and recurrence (P = 0.013)
      and early death due to breast cancer (P = 0.01). This association between high
      MSK1 expression and improved breast cancer-specific survival was observed in the 
      whole cohort (P = 0.009) and in the HER2-negative and non-basal like tumours
      (P = 0.006 and P = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis including other
      prognostic variables indicated that MSK1 is not an independent marker of outcome.
      Conclusions: High MSK1 is associated with improved breast cancer-specific
      survival in early stage invasive breast cancer patients, and has additional
      prognostic value in HER2-negative and non-basal like disease. Although not an
      independent marker of outcome, we believe such findings and significant
      associations with well-established negative prognostic factors (age, grade,
      Nottingham Prognostic Index, hormone receptor status, time to distant metastasis,
      recurrence and triple-negative/basal-like status) warrant further examination and
      validation in independent patient cohorts.

TI  - Differential microRNA expression in breast cancer with different onset age.
LID - e0191195
AB  - Purpose: The lower breast cancer incidence in Asian populations compared with
      Western populations has been speculated to be caused by environmental and genetic
      variation. Early-onset breast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast
      cancers in Asian populations, but the reason for this is unclear. We aimed to
      examine miRNA expression profiles in different age-onset groups and pathological 
      subtypes in Asian breast cancer. Methods: At the first stage, 10 samples (tumor: 
      n = 6, normal tissue: n = 4) were analyzed with an Agilent microRNA 470 probe
      microarray. Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that were significantly
      altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review were
      further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 145 breast cancer
      samples at the second stage of the process. Correlations between
      clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients from different age
      groups and candidate miRNA expression were elucidated. Results: In the present
      study, the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group, and an 
      onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates. For all
      breast cancer patients, miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated, and miR-21,
      miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-141 were up-regulated. In very young patients (age < 
      35 y/o), the expression of 3 and 8 specific miRNAs were up- and down-regulated,
      respectively. In young patients (36–40 y/o), 3 and 3 specific miRNAs were up- and
      down-regulated, respectively. miR-532-5p was up-regulated in triple-negative
      breast cancer. Conclusions: Differential miRNA expressions between normal and
      tumor tissues were observed in different age groups and tumor subtypes.
      Evolutionarily conserved miRNA clusters, which initiate malignancy
      transformation, were up-regulated in the breast cancers of very young patients.
      None of the significantly altered miRNAs were observed in postmenopausal
      patients.

AB  - The prevalence of cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has
      demonstrated prognostic value in multiple tumor types. In particular, CD8 counts 
      (in combination with CD3 and CD45RO) have been shown to be superior to
      traditional UICC staging in colon cancer patients and higher total CD8 counts
      have been associated with better survival in breast cancer patients. However,
      immune infiltrate heterogeneity can lead to potentially significant
      misrepresentations of marker prevalence in routine histologic sections. We
      examined step sections of breast and colorectal cancer samples for CD8+ T cell
      prevalence by standard chromogenic immunohistochemistry to determine marker
      variability and inform practice of T cell biomarker assessment in formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Stained sections were digitally imaged
      and CD8+ lymphocytes within defined regions of interest (ROI) including the tumor
      and surrounding stroma were enumerated. Statistical analyses of CD8+ cell count
      variability using a linear model/ANOVA framework between patients as well as
      between levels within a patient sample were performed. Our results show that CD8+
      T-cell distribution is highly homogeneous within a standard tissue sample in both
      colorectal and breast carcinomas. As such, cytotoxic T cell prevalence by
      immunohistochemistry on a single level or even from a subsample of biopsy
      fragments taken from that level can be considered representative of cytotoxic T
      cell infiltration for the entire tumor section within the block. These findings
      support the technical validity of biomarker strategies relying on CD8
      immunohistochemistry.

LID - e0190348
AB  - The objectives of the study were to develop a framework for automatic outer and
      inner breast tissue segmentation using multi-parametric MRI images of the breast 
      tumor patients; and to perform breast density and tumor tissue analysis. MRI of
      the breast was performed on 30 patients at 3T-MRI. T1, T2 and PD-weighted(W)
      images, with and without fat saturation(WWFS), and
      dynamic-contrast-enhanced(DCE)-MRI data were acquired. The proposed automatic
      segmentation approach was performed in two steps. In step-1, outer segmentation
      of breast tissue from rest of body parts was performed on structural images
      (T2-W/T1-W/PD-W without fat saturation images) using automatic landmarks
      detection technique based on operations like profile screening, Otsu
      thresholding, morphological operations and empirical observation. In step-2,
      inner segmentation of breast tissue into fibro-glandular(FG), fatty and tumor
      tissue was performed. For validation of breast tissue segmentation, manual
      segmentation was carried out by two radiologists and similarity coefficients(Dice
      and Jaccard) were computed for outer as well as inner tissues. FG density and
      tumor volume were also computed and analyzed. The proposed outer and inner
      segmentation approach worked well for all the subjects and was validated by two
      radiologists. The average Dice and Jaccard coefficients value for outer
      segmentation using T2-W images, obtained by two radiologists, were 0.977 and
      0.951 respectively. These coefficient values for FG tissue were 0.915 and 0.875
      respectively whereas for tumor tissue, values were 0.968 and 0.95 respectively.
      The volume of segmented tumor ranged over 2.1 cm3–7.08 cm3. The proposed approach
      provided automatic outer and inner breast tissue segmentation, which enables
      automatic calculations of breast tissue density and tumor volume. This is a
      complete framework for outer and inner breast segmentation method for all
      structural images.

TI  - Nanoparticle elasticity directs tumor uptake.
LID - 130
AB  - To date, the role of elasticity in drug delivery remains elusive due to the
      inability to measure microscale mechanics and alter rheology without affecting
      chemistry. Herein, we describe the in vitro cellular uptake and in vivo tumor
      uptake of nanolipogels (NLGs). NLGs are composed of identical lipid bilayers
      encapsulating an alginate core, with tunable elasticity. The elasticity of NLGs
      was evaluated by atomic force microscopy, which demonstrated that they exhibit
      Young’s moduli ranging from 45 ± 9 to 19,000 ± 5 kPa. Neoplastic and
      non-neoplastic cells exhibited significantly greater uptake of soft NLGs (Young’s
      modulus <1.6 MPa) relative to their elastic counterparts (Young’s modulus
      >13.8 MPa). In an orthotopic breast tumor model, soft NLGs accumulated
      significantly more in tumors, whereas elastic NLGs preferentially accumulated in 
      the liver. Our findings demonstrate that particle elasticity directs tumor
      accumulation, suggesting that it may be a design parameter to enhance tumor
      delivery efficiency.

TI  - Long term effects of manual lymphatic drainage and active exercises on physical
      morbidities, lymphoscintigraphy parameters and lymphedema formation in patients
      operated due to breast cancer: A clinical trial.
LID - e0189176
AB  - Purpose: evaluate whether manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) or active exercise (AE)
      is associated with shoulder range of motion (ROM), wound complication and changes
      in the lymphatic parameters after breast cancer (BC) surgery and whether these
      parameters have an association with lymphedema formation in the long run.
      Methods: Clinical trial with 106 women undergoing radical BC surgery, in the
      Women’s Integrated Healthcare Center—University of Campinas. Women were matched
      for staging, age and body mass index and were allocated to performed AE or MLD, 2
      weekly sessions during one month after surgery. The wound was evaluated 2 months 
      after surgery. ROM, upper limb circumference measurement and upper limb
      lymphoscintigraphy were performed before surgery, and 2 and 30 months after
      surgery. Results: The incidence of seroma, dehiscence and infection did not
      differ between groups. Both groups showed ROM deficit of flexion and abduction in
      the second month postoperative and partial recovery after 30 months. Cumulative
      incidence of lymphedema was 23.8% and did not differ between groups (p = 0.29).
      Concerning the lymphoscintigraphy parameters, there was a significant convergent 
      trend between baseline degree uptake (p = 0.003) and velocity visualization of
      axillary lymph nodes (p = 0.001) with lymphedema formation. A reduced marker
      uptake before or after surgery predicted lymphedema formation in the long run (>2
      years). None of the lymphoscintigraphy parameters were shown to be associated
      with the study group. Age ≤39 years was the factor with the greatest association 
      with lymphedema (p = 0.009). In women with age ≤39 years, BMI >24Kg/m2 was
      significantly associated with lymphedema (p = 0.017). In women over 39 years old,
      women treated with MLD were at a significantly higher risk of developing
      lymphedema (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Lymphatic abnormalities precede lymphedema
      formation in BC patients. In younger women, obesity seems to be the major player 
      in lymphedema development and, in older women, improving muscle strength through 
      AE can prevent lymphedema. In essence, MLD is as safe and effective as AE in
      rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery.

TI  - The use of automated Ki67 analysis to predict Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence
      categories in early-stage breast cancer.
LID - e0188983
AB  - Ki67 is a commonly used marker of cancer cell proliferation, and has significant 
      prognostic value in breast cancer. In spite of its clinical importance,
      assessment of Ki67 remains a challenge, as current manual scoring methods have
      high inter- and intra-user variability. A major reason for this variability is
      selection bias, in that different observers will score different regions of the
      same tumor. Here, we developed an automated Ki67 scoring method that eliminates
      selection bias, by using whole-slide analysis to identify and score the tumor
      regions with the highest proliferative rates. The Ki67 indices calculated using
      this method were highly concordant with manual scoring by a pathologist
      (Pearson’s r = 0.909) and between users (Pearson’s r = 0.984). We assessed the
      clinical validity of this method by scoring Ki67 from 328 whole-slide sections of
      resected early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-negative breast cancer. All patients had Oncotype DX testing performed
      (Genomic Health) and available Recurrence Scores. High Ki67 indices correlated
      significantly with several clinico-pathological correlates, including higher
      tumor grade (1 versus 3, P<0.001), higher mitotic score (1 versus 3, P<0.001),
      and lower Allred scores for estrogen and progesterone receptors (P = 0.002,
      0.008). High Ki67 indices were also significantly correlated with higher Oncotype
      DX risk-of-recurrence group (low versus high, P<0.001). Ki67 index was the major 
      contributor to a machine learning model which, when trained solely on
      clinico-pathological data and Ki67 scores, identified Oncotype DX high- and
      low-risk patients with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity and 80% specificity.
      Automated scoring of Ki67 can thus successfully address issues of consistency,
      reproducibility and accuracy, in a manner that integrates readily into the
      workflow of a pathology laboratory. Furthermore, automated Ki67 scores contribute
      significantly to models that predict risk of recurrence in breast cancer.

TI  - Breast cancer: The translation of big genomic data to cancer precision medicine.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of
      genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to cancer
      and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. For the
      past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from
      single‐gene to whole‐genome screening by using genome‐wide association study and 
      next‐generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International
      collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify
      clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings.
      Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of
      genomic alterations with high‐throughput screening as well as the use of genomic 
      information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which
      further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and
      monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing 
      data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine
      learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative “−omics” data to
      refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future.

TI  - Oestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in older
      women—Biological characteristics and long-term clinical outcome.
LID - e0188528
AB  - Background: Older women are at the greatest risk of breast cancer development and
      a considerable number present with comorbidities. Although the majority of breast
      cancers in this age group express oestrogen receptor (ER), which makes endocrine 
      therapy (primary or adjuvant) feasible, given the huge size of the elderly
      population, there remains a significant number of patients, in absolute term,
      whose tumours do not express ER and their management is challenging. Methods: Of 
      a consecutive series of 1,758 older (≥70 years) women with early operable primary
      breast cancer managed in a dedicated service from 1973–2010, 252(14.3%) had
      ER-negative (histochemical (H) score ≤50) tumours. Their clinical outcome was
      retrospectively reviewed and tumour samples collected from diagnostic core
      biopsies were analysed for progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki67 using
      immunohistochemistry. Results: The commonest primary treatment was surgery (N =
      194, 77%) followed by primary endocrine therapy (14.3%), primary radiotherapy
      (5.6%) and supportive treatment only (3.1%). Among the patients undergoing
      surgery, most of them had grade 3 (78.1%) and node-negative disease (62.2%). Some
      of them (21.1%) received postoperative radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of
      37.5 months, 117 patients had died, out of which 48.6% were due to breast cancer.
      For those who underwent surgery, the regional and local recurrence rates were 2% 
      and 1.1% per annum respectively. For those who received primary endocrine
      therapy, 38% progressed at 6 months, however all patients who had primary
      radiotherapy achieved clinical benefit at 6 months. Regardless of treatment
      given, the 5-year breast cancer specific and overall survival rates were 70% and 
      50% respectively. Biological analysis based on good quality needle core biopsy
      specimensfrom181 patients showed that 26.8% (N = 49), 16.9% (N = 31) and 70.7% (N
      = 70)expressed positivity for PgR, HER2 and Ki67 respectively. No correlation
      between these biomarkers and breast cancer specific survival was demonstrated.
      Conclusion: Oestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in
      older women is associated with poor prognostic features in terms of biology and
      clinical outcome. Surgery appears to produce the best outcome as a primary
      treatment, however for those where neither surgery nor chemotherapy is
      appropriate, primary radiotherapy can be beneficial.

TI  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the breast: Four case reports and review of the
      literature.
LID - e9385
AB  - Rationale:: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the breast is a rare entity
      comprising specific morphological and immunohistochemical features, and has been 
      previously only reported in 33 cases. Patient concerns:: Four cases of MEC of the
      breast are reported in this study. All patients were women with ages ranging from
      39 to 66 years. The lesions consisted of neoplastic solid nests and cystic spaces
      sometimes filled with mucoid material. Diagnoses:: At high power, the tumors were
      composed of various proportions of basaloid, intermediate, epidermoid, and
      mucinous cells in different cases. All cases were classified as low-grade MEC of 
      the breast. Tumor cells exhibited low levels of hormonal receptor expression in
      two cases (cases 1 and 3), and immunonegativity in one case (case 2). On the
      contrary, estrogen receptors (ER) were positively expressed in 60% of tumor cells
      in case 4. Tumor cells did not express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER-2)/neu protein in all the cases. Interventions:: Modified radical mastectomy
      (Auchincloss) was performed in the first two cases, while the remaining two
      patients underwent mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. Outcomes:: All
      patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrent disease after a period
      ranging from 4 months to 156 months. Lessons:: MEC of the breast is a rare
      primary carcinoma that is difficult to diagnose. Multiple tissue blocks are
      necessary before obtaining all cell types. Special stains for mucin and electron 
      microscopy would be helpful in suspected cases. Hormonal factors might have an
      impact on the biological behavior of tumors, but further studies are needed to
      draw conclusions.

TI  - Breast metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: a case report.
LID - 355
AB  - Background: Breast metastases from extramammary tumors are extremely rare, the
      most common primary tumors being contralateral breast carcinoma, followed by
      lung, gynecological, gastrointestinal, melanoma, and hematological cancers. Only 
      a few cases deriving from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been
      reported in the literature to date. Case presentation: We report a case of a
      47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary breast 
      lesion in the right upper external quadrant associated with multiple bone and
      visceral metastases. Two years before, she had undergone radical resection of a
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), which was followed by
      adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4
      cm in the right upper external quadrant that was associated with multiple
      axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies. A positron emission tomographic
      scan documented multiple visceral and bone metastases with a single
      hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast. The results of histology and
      immunohistochemistry were consistent with a metastasis from a squamous cell
      carcinoma. The patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency 1 month after her 
      breast metastasis diagnosis and before starting any systemic antitumoral
      treatment. Conclusions: Although breast metastases are extremely rare, they
      should be considered in any patient with a history of cancer and confirmed by
      histology and immunohistochemistry because they are very difficult to distinguish
      from other primary breast tumors based only on clinical and radiological
      features. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for breast metastasis
      management. Surgery and radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation, but
      they do not have any relevant impact on survival, the prognosis being poor, with 
      an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes of surgeon-performed intraoperative ultrasonography-guided
      wire localization and preoperative wire localization in nonpalpable breast cancer
      patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery: A retrospective cohort study.
LID - e9340
AB  - This study aimed to determine the efficacy of intraoperative
      ultrasonography-guided wire localization guided breast-conserving surgery (BCS)
      for nonpalpable breast cancer and compare it to conventional preoperative wire
      localization (PWL) guided surgery.We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts 
      of 214 consecutive nonpalpable breast cancer patients who underwent BCS using
      intraoperative ultrasonography-guided wire localization by a surgeon (IUWLS) and 
      PWL, between April 2013 and March 2017. Positive surgical margins, reexcision
      rates, and resection volumes were investigated.Of the total cohort, 124 patients 
      underwent BCS with IUWLS and 90 patients with PWL. The following did not differ
      between the IUWLS and PWL groups: positive margin status, re-excision rate,
      conversion rate, permanent positive margin status, reoperation rate, median
      optimal resection volume (ORV), median total resection volume (TRV), and median
      closest tumor-free margin. Rather, median (range) widest tumor-free margin was
      significantly smaller in the IUWLS group (9 mm [5–12]) than in the PWL group
      (14 mm [9–20]; P = .003]). Median (range) calculated resection ratio (CRR) was
      significantly lower in the IUWLS group (1.67 [0.87–9.38]) than in the PWL group
      (4.83 [1.63–21.04]; P = .02).In nonpalpable breast cancer patients undergoing
      BCS, IUWLS showed positive resection margins and reexcision rates equivalent to
      those of the conventional PWL method. Additionally, excision volume and widest
      tumor-free margin were smaller with IUWLS, confirming that healthy breast tissue 
      is less likely to be resected with this method. Our results suggest that IUWLS
      offers an excellent alternative to PWL, while avoiding PWL-induced patient
      discomfort.

TI  - Comparison of rigid and deformable registration through the respiratory phases of
      four-dimensional computed tomography image data sets for radiotherapy after
      breast-conserving surgery.
LID - e9143
AB  - Background:: The aim of this study was to compare the geometric differences in
      gross tumor volume (GTV) and surgical clips propagated by rigid image
      registration (RIR) and deformable image registration (DIR) using a
      four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) image data set for patients treated
      with boost irradiation or accelerated partial breast irradiation after
      breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Methods:: The 4DCT data sets of 44 patients who 
      had undergone BCS were acquired. GTV and selected clips were manually delineated 
      on end-inhalation phase (CT0) and end-exhalation phase (CT50) images of 4DCT data
      sets. Subsequently, the GTV and selected clips from CT0 images were transformed
      and propagated to CT50 images using RIR and DIR, respectively. The geometric
      differences in GTV and surgical clips from DIR were compared with those of RIR.
      Results:: The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) index was 0.860 ± 0.042 for 
      RIR and 0.870 ± 0.040 for DIR for GTV (P = .000). The three-dimensional distance 
      to the center of mass (COM) of the GTV from RIR was longer than that from DIR
      (1.22 mm and 1.10 mm, respectively, P = .000). Moreover, in the
      anterior–posterior direction, displacements from RIR were significantly greater
      than those from DIR for both GTV (0.70 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively) and selected
      clips (upper clip, 0.45 mm vs 0.20 mm; inner clip, 0.55 mm vs 0.30 mm; outer
      clip, 0.40 mm vs 0.20 mm; lower clip, 0.50 mm vs 0.25 mm) (P = .000). However, in
      the left–right and superior–inferior directions, there were no significant
      displacement differences between RIR and DIR for GTV and the selected clips (all 
      P > .050). Conclusion:: DIR can improve the overlap for GTV registration from CT0
      to CT50 images from 4DCT scanning. Furthermore, DIR is superior to RIR in
      reflecting the displacement of GTV and selected clips in the anterior–posterior
      direction induced by respiratory movement.

TI  - Prognostic utility of FDG PET/CT and bone scintigraphy in breast cancer patients 
      with bone-only metastasis.
LID - e8985
AB  - We performed this retrospective clinical study to examine the prognostic power of
      bone scintigraphy (BS) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in terms of overall survival (OS) of 
      breast cancer with bone-only metastasis.We retrospectively evaluated 100 female
      invasive ductal breast cancer patients (mean age 48.1 years) with bone-only
      metastasis. Twenty-five patients had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive tumors, 65 were estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone
      receptor (PR)-positive, HER2-negative tumors, and 10 were triple negative tumors.
      The patients were treated properly with various treatments, including
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone, and bisphosphonate therapy, based on their
      clinical status. All patients underwent BS and FDG PET/CT at baseline and 1 year 
      after treatment. The baseline and follow images were visually compared, and the
      patients were grouped as responders or nonresponders based on their images. OS
      was compared between the groups.The mean OS after the diagnosis of bone-only
      metastasis was 57.6 months. Fifty-one patients (51%) died within 5 years after
      diagnosis of metastasis. No difference in survival was evident between responders
      and nonresponders based on BS imaging data (P = .090). The response status based 
      on PET imaging data waste only significant independent prognostic factor on
      multivariate analysis (P = .001). Survival was lower in nonresponders than in
      responders based on PET imaging (32.7% vs 66.4%; P < .001).Our findings suggest
      that the response status according to FDG PET imaging can be used to predict OS
      in breast cancer patients with bone-only metastasis.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of contrast agent uptake in standard fat‐suppressed
      dynamic contrast‐enhanced MRI examinations of the breast.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Purpose: To propose a method to quantify T1 and contrast agent uptake in breast
      dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) examinations undertaken with standard clinical
      fat‐suppressed MRI sequences and to demonstrate the proposed approach by
      comparing the enhancement characteristics of lobular and ductal carcinomas.
      Methods: A standard fat‐suppressed DCE of the breast was performed at 1.5 T
      (Siemens Aera), followed by the acquisition of a proton density (PD)‐weighted
      sequence, also fat suppressed. Both sequences were characterized with test
      objects (T1 ranging from 30 ms to 2,400 ms) and calibration curves were obtained 
      to enable T1 calculation. The reproducibility and accuracy of the calibration
      curves were also investigated. Healthy volunteers and patients were scanned with 
      Ethics Committee approval. The effect of B0 field inhomogeneity was assessed in
      test objects and healthy volunteers. The T1 of breast tumors was calculated at
      different time points (pre‐, peak‐, and post‐contrast agent administration) for
      20 patients, pre‐treatment (10 lobular and 10 ductal carcinomas) and the two
      cancer types were compared (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test). Results: The calibration
      curves proved to be highly reproducible (coefficient of variation under 10%). T1 
      measurements were affected by B0 field inhomogeneity, but frequency shifts below 
      50 Hz introduced only 3% change to fat‐suppressed T1 measurements of breast
      parenchyma in volunteers. The values of T1 measured pre‐, peak‐, and
      post‐contrast agent administration demonstrated that the dynamic range of the DCE
      sequence was correct, that is, image intensity is approximately directly
      proportional to 1/T1 for that range. Significant differences were identified in
      the width of the distributions of the post‐contrast T1 values between lobular and
      ductal carcinomas (P < 0.05); lobular carcinomas demonstrated a wider range of
      post‐contrast T1 values, potentially related to their infiltrative growth
      pattern. Conclusions: This work has demonstrated the feasibility of
      fat‐suppressed T1 measurements as a tool for clinical studies. The proposed
      quantitative approach is practical, enabled the detection of differences between 
      lobular and invasive ductal carcinomas, and further enables the optimization of
      DCE protocols by tailoring the dynamic range of the sequence to the values of T1 
      measured.

TI  - Correlation study between osteoporosis and hematopoiesis in the context of
      adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.
PG  - 309-17
AB  - This retrospective study attempts to establish if a correlation exists between
      osteoporosis and hematopoiesis before and after adjuvant chemotherapy in the
      context of non-metastatic breast cancer. Osteoporosis is interpreted both as a
      direct marker of osteoblastic decline and as an indirect marker of increased bone
      marrow adiposity within the hematopoietic microenvironment. Patients from the
      “Centre du Sein” at CHUV (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois) undergoing
      adjuvant chemotherapy were included in this study. Evolution of blood counts was 
      studied in correlation with the osteoporosis status. Toxicity of chemotherapy was
      coded according to published probability of febrile neutropenia. One hundred
      forty-three women were included: mean age 52.1 ± 12.5 years, mean BMI (body mass 
      index) 24.4 ± 4.1. BMD (bone mineral density) scored osteoporotic in 32% and
      osteopenic in 45%. Prior to chemotherapy, BMD was positively correlated with
      neutrophil (p < 0.001) and thrombocyte (p = 0.01) count; TBS (trabecular bone
      score) was not correlated with blood count. After the first cycle of
      chemotherapy, an increase of one point in TBS correlated with a decrease of 57%
      on the time to reach leucocyte nadir (p = 0.004). There was a positive
      correlation between BMD and risk of infection (p < 0.001). Our data demonstrates 
      an association between osteoporosis and lower blood counts in a younger cohort
      than previously published, extending it for the first time to neutrophil counts
      in females. Our results suggest that the healthier the bone, the earlier the
      lowest leucocyte count value, prompting further research on this area.

TI  - Predictive value of BRCA1/2 mRNA expression for response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in BRCA‐negative breast cancers.
PG  - 166-73
AB  - It is well known that BRCA1 and BRCA2 play a central role in DNA repair, but the 
      relationship between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression and response to neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy in sporadic breast cancer patients has not been well established.
      Here, we investigate the association between BRCA1 or BRCA2 mRNA expression
      levels and pathological response in 674 BRCA1/2 mutation‐negative breast cancer
      patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression
      were assessed using quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction in core
      biopsy breast cancer tissue obtained prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. A total 129 patients (19.1%) achieved pathological complete
      response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among patients treated with
      anthracycline‐based chemotherapy (n = 531), BRCA1 mRNA low expression patients
      had a significantly higher pCR rate than intermediate or high BRCA1 mRNA
      expression groups (24.6% vs 16.8% or 14.0%, P = .031) and retained borderline
      significance (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 0.93‐2.56, P = .094) in multivariate analysis. 
      Among the 129 patients who received a taxane‐based regimen, pCR rate showed no
      differences in BRCA1 low, intermediate, and high mRNA level subgroups (19.6%,
      26.8% and 21.4%, respectively; P = .71). BRCA2 mRNA level was not associated with
      pCR rate in the anthracyline‐based treated subgroup (P = .60) or the taxane‐based
      regimen subgroup (P = .82). Taken together, our findings suggested that BRCA1
      mRNA expression could be used as a predictive marker in BRCA1/2 mutation‐negative
      breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant anthracycline‐based treatment.

TI  - Preferential expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 in male breast cancer.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Background: Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease often discovered in
      advanced stage; thus, in the setting of metastatic adenocarcinoma, breast origin 
      must be taken to account. Breast markers as NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and
      BRST-2 are established tools for labelling primary and metastatic female breast
      cancer; however, none of them has been sufficiently studied in male breast
      cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of these markers in
      male breast cancer. Materials and methods: Thirty consecutive cases of male
      breast cancer and eight loco-regional metastases were re-revaluated, assembled in
      tissue micro array (TMA), and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for
      NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2. The IHC stains were scored either
      positive or negative. In addition, concordant expression patterns of primary
      tumors and matched metastasis were noted. Results: 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors
      and 8 of 8 (100%) metastases were positive for NY-BR-1. 30 of 30 (100%) primary
      tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for GATA-3. 22 of 30 (73.3%)
      primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for Mammaglobin. 18 of
      30 (60%) primary tumors and 5 of 8 (62.5%) metastases were positive for BRST-2.
      Differences in staining percentage were not significant with Fisher’s exact test.
      Conclusion: We found a high sensitivity for all the markers analyzed. Moreover,
      the expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male
      breast cancer in primary and metastatic setting.

AB  - Breast tuberculosis is rare. It poses a problem of differential diagnosis because
      it may be mistaken for breast cancer as clinical examination and diagnostic
      imaging are not specific. Breast tuberculosis should be suspected especially in

      menopausal woman with breast tuberculosis in order to raise concern for
      diagnosis.

TI  - Application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in occult breast cancer: Five case
      reports.
LID - e8200
AB  - Rationale:: Although rare, occult breast cancer (OBC) originates from breast
      tissue. Its primary lesions cannot be identified by clinical examination or
      imaging; therefore, the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis remain controversial.
      Patient concerns:: This study comprised 5 female OBC patients who were admitted
      to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University for painless axillary
      lumps. Diagnoses:: 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) indicated metastasis in the ipsilateral
      axillary lymph nodes. No clear breast primary lesions were identified; other
      organs were also excluded as the primary site. Pathological biopsy confirmed
      axillary lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of
      the tumor to identify the source revealed that estrogen receptors (ERs) and
      progesterone receptors (PgRs) were positive in 2 cases, ER was positive and PR
      was negative in 1 case, and both were negative in 2 cases. Human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 was negative in all cases. All patients were diagnosed with
      OBC. Interventions:: All patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). One
      patient did not undergo follow-up therapy. The other 4 underwent total mastectomy
      plus axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy. Two patients also
      underwent endocrine therapy. Outcomes:: Patients were followed up for 9.0 to 72.0
      months. Four achieved pathological complete response. One patient experienced
      metastasis to the ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes 2.0 years later, which 
      was cleared after additional treatment. The other patients were tumor free.
      Lessons:: Here, we are reporting 5 cases of OBC treated with NAC that were
      evaluated by 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. This study suggests that NAC might lead to a
      positive outcome.

AB  - We report the case of Ms. A.A, a primiparous woman aged 21 years presenting (4
      months after delivery) with an increase in left breast volume occurred 1 week
      after delivery associated with fever. The patient was put on amoxicillin,
      protected by suspending breast-feeding for several weeks without improvement.
      Clinical examination showed febrile patient with a temperature of 39°, an
      increase in left breast volume, inflammatory signs especially at the level of
      internal quadrants (A). Palpation showed a painful, hot collection adherent to
      the skin, measuring 16 cm, at the level of the internal quadrants, invading the
      external quadrants, without axillary adenopathies, suggesting breast abscess.
      Ultrasound (B) showed voluminous solidocystic predominantly liquid echogenic mass
      with thick walls and buds up to 46 mm, classified as ACR4. Puncture biopsy
      collected grayish green liquid, sent for bacteriological examination; antibiotic 
      therapy with quinolones was started. Follow up of patient, after 3 days, showed
      reduction of the inflammatory signs and bacteriological examination of the liquid
      found no germ. After 15 days of antibiotic therapy, the inflammatory signs had
      disappeared and the volume of the mass had reduced enough, hence the indication
      for cystectomy. Cystectomy with simple enucleation was performed (C);
      surprisingly, the histological examination showed cystic fibroadenoma (D).

      patients in southern Iran using Cox and empirical Bayesian additive hazard
      models.
LID - e2017043
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A survival analysis of breast cancer patients in southern Iran
      according to age has yet to be conducted. This study aimed to quantify the
      factors contributing to a poor prognosis, using Cox and empirical Bayesian
      additive hazard (EBAH) models, among young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-64
      years), and elderly (≥ 65 years) women. METHODS: Data from 1,574 breast cancer
      patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2012 in the cancer registry of Fars Province
      (southern Iran) were stratified into 3 age groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was
      used to estimate the overall survival rates. Cox and EBAH models were applied to 
      each age category, and the Akaike information criterion was used to assess the
      goodness-of-fit of the 2 hazard models. RESULTS: As of December 2012, 212 women
      (13.5%) in our study population had died, of whom 43 were young (15.3%), 134
      middle-aged (11.8%), and 35 elderly (22.3%). The 5-year survival probability by
      age category was 0.83 (standard error [SE], 0.03), 0.88 (SE, 0.01), and 0.75 (SE,
      0.04), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Nottingham Prognostic Index was the most
      effective prognostic factor. The model based on Bayesian methodology performed
      better with various sample sizes than the Cox model, which is the most widely
      used method of survival analysis.

TI  - Authentication of M14 melanoma cell line proves misidentification of MDA‐MB‐435
      breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 561-72
AB  - A variety of analytical approaches have indicated that melanoma cell line
      UCLA‐SO‐M14 (M14) and breast carcinoma cell line MDA‐MB‐435 originate from a
      common donor. This indicates that at some point in the past, one of these cell
      lines became misidentified, meaning that it ceased to correspond to the reported 
      donor and instead became falsely identified (through cross‐contamination or other
      means) as a cell line from a different donor. Initial studies concluded that
      MDA‐MB‐435 was the misidentified cell line and M14 was the authentic cell line,
      although contradictory evidence has been published, resulting in further
      confusion. To address this question, we obtained early samples of the melanoma
      cell line (M14), a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same donor (ML14), and donor
      serum preserved at the originator's institution. M14 samples were cryopreserved
      in December 1975, before MDA‐MB‐435 cells were established in culture. Through a 
      series of molecular characterizations, including short tandem repeat (STR)
      profiling and cytogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that later samples of M14 and
      MDA‐MB‐435 correspond to samples of M14 frozen in 1975, to the lymphoblastoid
      cell line ML14, and to the melanoma donor's STR profile, sex and blood type. This
      work demonstrates conclusively that M14 is the authentic cell line and MDA‐MB‐435
      is misidentified. With clear provenance information and authentication testing of
      early samples, it is possible to resolve debates regarding the origins of
      problematic cell lines that are widely used in cancer research.

TI  - The Impact of Treatment Preferences in Second-Line Chemotherapy on the Prognosis 
      of HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - Objective: We assessed the impact of treatment preferences in second-line
      chemotherapy on breast cancer prognosis using the SELECT BC study. Methods: The
      SELECT BC study was performed in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer treated with initial chemotherapy. From these patients, 618 were assigned 
      to 2 groups (S-1 group, 309; taxane group, 309). The S-1 and taxane groups were
      each subdivided into 3 groups: crossover group, protocol-recommended group, and
      other group, and the analysis of overall survival (OS) was performed using Cox
      regression with inverse probability weighting, to adjust for postrandomization
      confounding. Results: In the taxane group, the OS of the crossover group (39.6
      months) was better than that of the protocol-recommended group (35.7 months) and 
      the other chemotherapy group (36.9 months) (vs. the protocol-recommended group,
      HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.52–0.98], p = 0.037; vs. the other chemotherapy group, HR 0.71 
      [95% CI 0.43–1.18], p = 0.183). In the S-1 group, there was no statistically
      significant difference in OS between the 3 groups. Conclusion: The study of the
      combination of first-line chemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy showed that
      S-1 might be recommended as a second-line chemotherapy in patients in whom taxane
      was the primary chemotherapy.

TI  - Monitoring deep inspiration breath hold for left‐sided localized breast cancer
      radiotherapy with an in‐house developed laser distance meter system.
PG  - 117-23
AB  - Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) in left‐sided breast cancer radiotherapy is a
      technique to reduce cardiac and pulmonary doses while maintaining target
      coverage. This study aims at evaluating an in‐house developed DIBH system.
      Free‐breathing (FB) and DIBH plans were generated for 22 left‐sided localized
      breast cancer patients who had radiation therapy (RT) after breast‐conserving
      surgery. All patients were treated utilizing an in‐house laser distance measuring
      system. 50 Gy was prescribed, and parameters of interest were target coverage,
      left anterior descending coronary artery, (LAD) and heart doses. Portal images
      were acquired and the reproducibility and stability of DIBH treatment were
      compared to FB. The comparing result shows there is a significant reduction in
      all LAD and heart dose statistics for DIBH compared to FB plans without
      compromising the target coverage. The maximum LAD dose was reduced from 43.7 Gy
      to 29.0 Gy and the volume of the heart receiving >25 Gy was reduced from 3.3% to 
      1.0% using the in‐house system, both statistically significant. The in‐house
      system gave a reproducible and stable DIBH treatment where the systematic error
      ∑, and random error σ, were less than 2.2 mm in all directions, but were not
      significantly better than at FB. The system was well tolerated and all patients
      completed their treatment sessions with DIBH.

TI  - Body Mass Index Mediates the Prognostic Significance of Circulating Tumor Cells
      in Inflammatory Breast Cancer.
PG  - 666-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity (BMI≥30) may be an etiologic and prognostic factor in
      inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). We examined the relationship between BMI,
      pathologic complete response (pCR), and circulating-tumor-cell (CTC) levels in
      IBC. METHODS: Cohort included IBC patients diagnosed 2005–2015 who had
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy during a prospective trial on CTCs and pathologic review
      describing pCR. Chi-square, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards
      models were used to identify clinicopathologic associations with event-free
      survival (EFS). RESULTS: Of 73 patients, 61 (84%) had CTC values, 22 (30%)
      achieved a pCR, and 39 (53%) were obese. There was no difference between obese
      and non-obese patients for pCR rates (31% vs. 29%, p=0.90) or presence of CTCs
      (23% vs. 26%, p=0.80). Among non-obese patients, CTCs were associated with worse 
      EFS (HR 11.69, p<0.01), but among obese patients, there was no difference in EFS 
      between those with and without CTCs. CONCLUSIONS: BMI mediates CTCs’ prognostic
      significance in IBC.

TI  - Mammographic Density Reduction as a Prognostic Marker for Postmenopausal Breast
      Cancer: Results Using a Joint Longitudinal-Survival Modeling Approach.
PG  - 1065-73
AB  - Previous studies have linked reductions in mammographic density after a breast
      cancer diagnosis to an improved prognosis. These studies focused on short-term
      change, using a 2-stage process, treating estimated change as a fixed covariate
      in a survival model. We propose the use of a joint longitudinal-survival model.
      This enables us to model long-term trends in density while accounting for dropout
      as well as for measurement error. We studied the change in mammographic density
      after a breast cancer diagnosis and its association with prognosis (measured by
      cause-specific mortality), overall and with respect to hormone replacement
      therapy and tamoxifen treatment. We included 1,740 women aged 50–74 years,
      diagnosed with breast cancer in Sweden during 1993–1995, with follow-up until
      2008. They had a total of 6,317 mammographic density measures available from the 
      first 5 years of follow-up, including baseline measures. We found that the impact
      of the withdrawal of hormone replacement therapy on density reduction was larger 
      than that of tamoxifen treatment. Unlike previous studies, we found that there
      was an association between density reduction and survival, both for
      tamoxifen-treated women and women who were not treated with tamoxifen.

TI  - Development of the breast immobilization system in prone setup: The effect of bra
      in prone position to improve the breast setup error.
PG  - 155-60
AB  - Purpose/objective(s): Accurate and reproducible positioning of the breast is
      difficult due to its deformability and softness; thus, targeting a breast tumor
      or tumor bed with fractionated radiotherapy using external beam radiation is
      difficult. The aim of this study was to develop a novel bra to aid in breast
      immobilization in the prone position. Materials & methods: To assess the accuracy
      of prone position fixation of breast tumors, 33 breast cancer patients with 34
      lesions were recruited. The bra used in this verification was customized from a
      commercially available bra. Duplicate MRI were acquired in the prone position,
      alternating with and without the bra, and for each series, patients were asked to
      step off the MRI table and re‐set up in the prone position. Patients were also
      asked to remove and re‐fit the bra for the second MRI. Each pair of images were
      superimposed to match the shape of the skin surface, and the maximum difference
      in tumor geometric center in three axes was measured. The required set up margin 
      was calculated as: required margin = mean difference in geometric center + 2.5
      standard deviation. The volumetric overlap of the tumor, as well as contouring
      uncertainties, was evaluated using contour analysis software. Results: The median
      breast size was 498 cc. The required margins for the lateral, vertical, and
      longitudinal directions were estimated to be 4.1, 4.1, and 5.0 mm, respectively, 
      with the bra, and 5.1, 6.9, and 6.7 mm, respectively, without the bra. These
      margins covered the dislocation of more than 33 lesions in total. With the bra,
      33 lesions had achieved an objective overlap of 95% and 99% with 2 and 4 mm
      margins, respectively, whereas 4 and 8 mm, respectively, were needed without the 
      bra. Conclusion: The use of an immobilizing bra reduced the setup margin for
      prone position fixation of breast tumors.

TI  - Breast tissue stiffness estimation for surgical guidance using gravity-induced
      excitation.
PG  - 4756-76
AB  - Tissue stiffness interrogation is fundamental in breast cancer diagnosis and
      treatment. Furthermore, biomechanical models for predicting breast deformations
      have been created for several breast cancer applications. Within these
      applications, constitutive mechanical properties must be defined and the accuracy
      of this estimation directly impacts the overall performance of the model. In this
      study, we present an image-derived computational framework to obtain
      quantitative, patient specific stiffness properties for application in
      image-guided breast cancer surgery and interventions. The method uses two MR
      acquisitions of the breast in different supine gravity-loaded configurations to
      fit mechanical properties to a biomechanical breast model. A reproducibility
      assessment of the method was performed in a test–retest study using healthy
      volunteers and was further characterized in simulation. In five human data sets, 
      the within subject coefficient of variation ranged from 10.7% to 27% and the
      intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.91–0.944 for assessment of
      fibroglandular and adipose tissue stiffness. In simulation, fibroglandular
      content and deformation magnitude were shown to have significant effects on the
      shape and convexity of the objective function defined by image similarity. These 
      observations provide an important step forward in characterizing the use of
      nonrigid image registration methodologies in conjunction with biomechanical
      models to estimate tissue stiffness. In addition, the results suggest that
      stiffness estimation methods using gravity-induced excitation can reliably and
      feasibly be implemented in breast cancer surgery/intervention workflows.

TI  - Weight and weight changes in early adulthood and later breast cancer risk.
PG  - 2003-14
AB  - Obesity is a well-established cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. However,
      early life adiposity is inversely associated with breast cancer incidence. To
      understand these conflicting relations, we use validated measures to assess
      adiposity in childhood and late adolescence, as well as weight change, in
      relation to total invasive breast cancer incidence and receptor subtypes.We
      conducted a prospective observational study among 74,177 women from the Nurses’
      Health Study from 1980–2012, with updated risk factors every 2 years during which
      4965 incident invasive breast cancers occurred.Overall, weight at age 18 was
      inversely associated with both premenopausal (HR per 30 kg = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.39 
      – 0.71) and postmenopausal (HR per 30 kg = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72 – 0.92) breast
      cancer which was largely explained by adiposity at age 10. Long-term weight gain 
      from age 18 both during premenopause and postmenopause were positively associated
      with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. However, premenopausal weight gain was
      not related to premenopausal breast cancer risk. Furthermore, weight gain since
      age 18 was positively associated with ER+/PR+ postmenopausal breast cancer (HR
      per 30 kg = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.36 – 1.65) but not ER+/PR− (HR per 30 kg = 0.96, 95%
      CI = 0.78 – 1.19) or ER−/PR− (HR per 30 kg = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.95 – 1.42)
      postmenopausal breast cancer.Overall, 17% of ER+/PR+ postmenopausal breast cancer
      and 14% of total postmenopausal breast cancer are attributable to weight gain of 
      > 5 kg since age 18.

TI  - State Variation in the Receipt of a Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy Among
      Women Who Received a Diagnosis of Invasive Unilateral Early-Stage Breast Cancer
      in the United States, 2004-2012.
PG  - 648-57
AB  - Importance: The use of contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (CPMs) among
      patients with invasive unilateral breast cancer has increased substantially
      during the past decade in the United States despite the lack of evidence for
      survival benefit. However, whether this trend varies by state or whether it is
      correlated with changes in proportions of reconstructive surgery among these
      patients is unclear. Objective: To determine state variation in the temporal
      trend and in the proportion of CPMs among women with early-stage unilateral
      breast cancer treated with surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: A
      retrospective cohort study of 1.2 million women 20 years of age or older
      diagnosed with invasive unilateral early-stage breast cancer and treated with
      surgery from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2012, in 45 states and the
      District of Columbia as compiled by the North American Association of Central
      Cancer Registries. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2015, to August 31,
      2016. Exposure: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Main Outcomes and
      Measures: Temporal changes in the proportion of CPMs among women with early-stage
      unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery by age and state, overall and in
      relation to changes in the proportions of those who underwent reconstructive
      surgery. Results: Among the 1 224 947 women with early-stage breast cancer
      treated with surgery, the proportion who underwent a CPM nationally increased
      between 2004 and 2012 from 3.6% (4013 of 113 001) to 10.4% (12 890 of 124 231)
      for those 45 years or older and from 10.5% (1879 of 17 862) to 33.3% (5237 of
      15 745) for those aged 20 to 44 years. The increase was evident in all states,
      although the magnitude of the increase varied substantially across states. For
      example, among women 20 to 44 years of age, the proportion who underwent a CPM
      from 2004-2006 to 2010-2012 increased from 14.9% (317 of 2121) to 24.8% (436 of
      1755) (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.46-1.89) in New Jersey compared
      with an increase from 9.8% (162 of 1657) to 32.2% (495 of 1538) (PR, 3.29; 95%
      CI, 2.80-3.88) in Virginia. In this age group, CPM proportions for the period
      from 2010 to 2012 were over 42% in the contiguous states of Nebraska, Missouri,
      Colorado, Iowa, and South Dakota. From 2004 to 2012, the proportion of
      reconstructive surgical procedures among women aged 20 to 44 years who were
      diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and received a CPM increased in many
      states; however, it did not correlate with the proportion of women who received a
      CPM. Conclusions and Relevance: The increase in the proportion of CPMs among
      women with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery varied
      substantially across states. Notably, in 5 contiguous Midwest states, nearly half
      of young women with invasive early-stage breast cancer underwent a CPM from 2010 
      to 2012. Future studies should examine the reasons for the geographic variation
      and increasing trend in the use of CPMs.

TI  - Optimization of intra‐voxel incoherent motion measurement in diffusion‐weighted
      imaging of breast cancer.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to optimize intra‐voxel incoherent motion 
      (IVIM) measurement in diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) of breast cancer by
      separating perfusion and diffusion effects through the determination of an
      optimal threshold b‐value, thus benign and cancerous breast tissues can be
      accurately differentiated using IVIM‐derived diffusion and perfusion parameters. 
      Materials and Methods: Twenty‐eight patients, with biopsy‐confirmed breast
      cancers, were studied with a 3T MRI scanner, using T1‐weighted dynamic
      contrast‐enhanced MRI images, and diffusion‐weighted images with nine b‐values,
      ranging from 0 to 1000 s/mm². IVIM‐derived parameter maps for tissue diffusion
      coefficients D, perfusion fraction f, and pseudo‐diffusion coefficients D* were
      computed using the segmented fitting method with optimized threshold b‐value, and
      the sum of squared residuals (SSR) were calculated for IVIM‐derived parameters in
      different breast lesions. Results: The IVIM analysis method developed in this
      work can separate perfusion and diffusion effects with the optimal threshold
      b‐value of 300 s/mm², and the results of diffusion and perfusion parameters from 
      IVIM analysis can be used to differentiate pathological changes in breast
      tissues. It was found that the averages and standard deviations of the diffusion 
      and perfusion parameters, D, f, D*, are the following, for malignant, benign and 
      normal breast tissues respectively: D (0.813 ± 0.225 × 10−3 mm2/s, 1.437 ± 0.538 
      × 10−3 mm2/s, 1.838 ± 0.213 × 10−3 mm2/s), f (10.73 ± 3.44%, 7.86 ± 3.70%, 8.92 ±
      3.72%), D* (15.23 ± 12.17×10−3 mm²/s, 12.02 ± 3.19 × 10−3 mm2/s, 12.03 ± 7.21 ×
      10−3 mm2/s). Conclusion: IVIM‐derived diffusion and perfusion parameter maps
      depend highly on the choice of threshold b‐value. Using the methodology developed
      in this work, and with the optimized threshold b‐value, the diffusion and
      perfusion parameters of breast tissues can be accurately assessed, making IVIM
      MRI a technique of choice for differential diagnosis of breast cancer.

TI  - Brain Metastases in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Study.
PG  - 1069-77
AB  - Question: What are the incidence and prognosis of patients with breast cancer and
      brain metastases at diagnosis? Findings: In this population-based cohort study,
      patients with triple-negative and hormone receptor–negative human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2–positive subtypes and metastatic disease to any distant 
      site harbored the highest likelihood (11.37% and 11.45%, respectively) of
      presenting with brain metastases at diagnosis of breast cancer. The prognosis of 
      patients with triple-negative disease was poorest (median survival, 6 months).
      Meaning: Future studies evaluating the utility of screening brain magnetic
      resonance imaging among patients at high risk of brain metastases may be
      warranted.

TI  - Association of the Timing of Pregnancy With Survival in Women With Breast Cancer.
PG  - 659-65
AB  - Importance: Increasing numbers of women experience pregnancy around the time of, 
      or after, a diagnosis of breast cancer. Understanding the effect of pregnancy on 
      survival in women with breast cancer will help in the counseling and treatment of
      these women. Objective: To compare the overall survival of women diagnosed with
      breast cancer during pregnancy or in the postpartum period with that of women who
      had breast cancer but did not become pregnant. Design, Setting, and Participants:
      This population-based, retrospective cohort study linked health administrative
      databases in Ontario, Canada, comprising 7553 women aged 20 to 45 years at the
      time of diagnosis with invasive breast cancer, from January 1, 2003, to December 
      31, 2014. Exposures: Any pregnancy in the period from 5 years before, until 5
      years after, the index date of the diagnosis of breast cancer. Women were
      classified into the following 4 exposure groups: no pregnancy (the referent),
      pregnancy before breast cancer, pregnancy-associated breast cancer, and pregnancy
      following breast cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five-year actuarial survival
      rates for all exposure groups, age-adjusted and multivariable hazard ratios [HRs]
      of pregnancy for overall survival for all exposure groups, and time-dependent
      hazard ratios for women with pregnancy following breast cancer. Results: Among
      the 7553 women in the study (mean age at diagnosis, 39.1 years; median, 40 years;
      range, 20-44 years) the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 87.5% (95% CI,
      86.5%-88.4%) for women with no pregnancy, 85.3% (95% CI, 82.8%-87.8%) for women
      with pregnancy before breast cancer (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI,
      0.85-1.27; P = .73), and 82.1% (95% CI, 78.3%-85.9%) for women with
      pregnancy-associated breast cancer (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI,
      0.91-1.53; P = .20). The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 96.7% (95% CI,
      94.1%-99.3%) for women who had pregnancy 6 months or more after diagnosis of
      breast cancer, vs 87.5% (95% CI, 86.5%-88.4%) for women with no pregnancy)
      (age-adjusted HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.49; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: 
      Pregnancy did not adversely affect survival in women with breast cancer. For
      breast cancer survivors who wish to conceive, the risk of death is lowest if
      pregnancy occurs 6 months or more after diagnosis.

TI  - Adjuvant Capecitabine in Combination With Docetaxel, Epirubicin, and
      Cyclophosphamide for Early Breast Cancer: The Randomized Clinical FinXX Trial.
PG  - 793-800
AB  - Question: Does integration of capecitabine into a taxane- and
      anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen improve survival as adjuvant
      treatment of early breast cancer? Findings: In the FinXX trial, patients randomly
      allocated to receive a capecitabine-containing regimen did not survive longer
      than patients treated without capecitabine during a median follow-up of 10.3
      years. The subset of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) survived 
      longer when treated with the capecitabine-containing regimen. Meaning:
      Integration of capecitabine into adjuvant chemotherapy did not prolong survival, 
      but patients with TNBC may benefit from capecitabine.

TI  - Intrinsic Subtypes and Gene Expression Profiles in Primary and Metastatic Breast 
      Cancer.
PG  - 2213-21
AB  - Biological changes that occur during metastatic progression of breast cancer are 
      still incompletely characterized. In this study, we compared intrinsic molecular 
      subtypes and gene expression in 123 paired primary and metastatic tissues from
      breast cancer patients. Intrinsic subtype was identified using a PAM50 classifier
      and χ2 tests determined the differences in variable distribution. The rate of
      subtype conversion was 0% in basal-like tumors, 23.1% in HER2-enriched (HER2-E)
      tumors, 30.0% in luminal B tumors, and 55.3% in luminal A tumors. In 40.2% of
      cases, luminal A tumors converted to luminal B tumors, whereas in 14.3% of cases 
      luminal A and B tumors converted to HER2-E tumors. We identified 47 genes that
      were expressed differentially in metastatic versus primary disease. Metastatic
      tumors were enriched for proliferation-related and migration-related genes and
      diminished for luminal-related genes. Expression of proliferation-related genes
      were better at predicting overall survival in metastatic disease (OSmet) when
      analyzed in metastatic tissue rather than primary tissue. In contrast, a
      basal-like gene expression signature was better at predicting OSmet in primary
      disease compared with metastatic tissue. We observed correlations between time to
      tumor relapse and the magnitude of changes of proliferation, luminal B, or HER2-E
      signatures in metastatic versus primary disease. Although the intrinsic subtype
      was largely maintained during metastatic progression, luminal/HER2-negative
      tumors acquired a luminal B or HER2-E profile during metastatic progression,
      likely reflecting tumor evolution or acquisition of estrogen independence.
      Overall, our analysis revealed the value of stratifying gene expression by both
      cancer subtype and tissue type, providing clinicians more refined tools to
      evaluate prognosis and treatment.

TI  - Lung volume reproducibility under ABC control and self‐sustained breath‐holding.
PG  - 154-62
AB  - An Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) can be employed to induce breath‐holds
      during CT imaging and radiotherapy of lung, breast and liver cancer, and recently
      during lung cancer MRI. The apparatus measures and controls respiratory volume,
      hence subject lung volume reproducibility is its principal measure of
      effectiveness. To assess ABC control quality, the intra‐session reproducibility
      of ABC‐induced lung volumes was evaluated and compared with that reached by
      applying the clinical standard of operator‐guided self‐sustained breath‐holds on 
      healthy volunteers during MRI. Inter‐session reproducibility was investigated by 
      repeating ABC‐controlled breath‐holds on a second visit. Additionally, lung
      volume agreement with ABC devices used with different imaging modalities in the
      same institution (MR, CT), or for a breast trial treatment, was assessed. Lung
      volumes were derived from three‐dimensional (3D) T1‐weighted MRI datasets by
      three observers employing semiautomatic lung delineation on a radiotherapy
      treatment planning system. Inter‐observer variability was less than 6% of the
      delineated lung volumes. Lung volume agreement between the different conditions
      over all subjects was investigated using descriptive statistics. The ABC
      equipment dedicated for MR application exhibited good intra‐session and
      inter‐session lung volume reproducibility (1.8% and 3% lung volume variability on
      average, respectively). MR‐assessed lung volumes were similar using different ABC
      equipment dedicated to MR, CT, or breast radiotherapy. Overall, lung volumes
      controlled by the same or different ABC devices agreed better than with
      self‐controlled breath‐holds, as suggested by the average ABC variation of 1.8%
      of the measured lung volumes (99 mL), compared to the 4.1% (226 mL) variability
      observed on average with self‐sustained breath‐holding.

TI  - Genomic characterization of HER2-positive breast cancer and response to
      neoadjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy—results from the ACOSOG Z1041 (Alliance)
      trial.
PG  - 1070-7
AB  - Background: HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification and its corresponding overexpression 
      are present in 15–30% of invasive breast cancers. While HER2-targeted agents are 
      effective treatments, resistance remains a major cause of death. The American
      College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1041 trial (NCT00513292) was designed to
      compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of distinct regimens of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab, but ultimately identified no
      difference. Patients and methods: In supplement to tissues from 37 Z1041 cases,
      11 similarly treated cases were obtained from a single institution study
      (NCT00353483). We have extracted genomic DNA from both pre-treatment tumor
      biopsies and blood of these 48 cases, and performed whole genome (WGS) and exome 
      sequencing. Coincident with these efforts, we have generated RNA-seq profiles
      from 42 of the tumor biopsies. Among patients in this cohort, 24 (50%) achieved a
      pCR. Results: We have characterized the genomic landscape of HER2-positive breast
      cancer and investigated associations between genomic features and pCR. Cases
      assigned to the HER2-enriched subtype by RNA-seq analysis were more likely to
      achieve a pCR compared to the luminal, basal-like, or normal-like subtypes (19/27
      versus 3/15; P = 0.0032). Mutational events led to the generation of putatively
      active neoantigens, but were overall not associated with pCR. ERBB2 and GRB7 were
      the genes most commonly observed in fusion events, and genomic copy number
      analysis of the ERBB2 locus indicated that cases with either no observable or
      low-level ERBB2 amplification were less likely to achieve a pCR (7/8 versus
      17/40; P = 0.048). Moreover, among cases that achieved a pCR, tumors consistently
      expressed immune signatures that may contribute to therapeutic response.
      Conclusion: The identification of these features suggests that it may be possible
      to predict, at the time of diagnosis, those HER2-positive breast cancer patients 
      who will not respond to treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab.

TI  - Sleep duration and breast cancer prognosis: perspectives from the Women's Healthy
      Eating and Living Study.
PG  - 581-9
AB  - Purpose: To examine whether baseline sleep duration or changes in sleep duration 
      are associated with breast cancer prognosis among early-stage breast cancer
      survivors in the multi-center Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study. Methods:
      Data were collected from 1995 to 2010. Analysis included 3047 women. Sleep
      duration was self-reported at baseline and follow-up intervals. Cox proportional 
      hazard models were used to investigate whether baseline sleep duration was
      associated with breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and
      all-cause mortality. Time-varying models investigated whether changes in sleep
      duration were associated with breast cancer prognosis. Results: Compared to women
      who slept 7–8 h/night at baseline, sleeping ≥9 h/night was associated with a 48% 
      increased risk of breast cancer recurrence (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, 95%
      Confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 2.00), a 52% increased risk of breast
      cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09, 2.13), and a 43% greater risk of
      all-cause mortality (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07, 1.92). Time-varying models showed
      analogous increased risk in those who inconsistently slept ≥9 h/night (all P <
      0.05), but not in those who consistently slept ≥9 h/night. Conclusions:
      Consistent long or short sleep, which may reflect inter-individual variability in
      the need for sleep, does not appear to influence prognosis among early-stage
      breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Question: Can breast cancer of the chest wall be treated with chemoimmunotherapy?
      Findings: In a single-arm phase 2 clinical trial of 14 patients, 5 achieved a
      compete response and 5 were partial responders for an overall response rate of
      72%. Elevated pretreatment levels of peripheral blood programmed death-1–positive
      T cells and monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells were associated with
      suboptimal response. Meaning: Even in treatment-refractory disease,
      chemoimmunotherapy can induce remission. Peripheral blood biomarkers associated
      with response can be identified.

TI  - Electromagnetic tracking (EMT) technology for improved treatment quality
      assurance in interstitial brachytherapy.
PG  - 211-22
AB  - Electromagnetic Tracking (EMT) is a novel technique for error detection and
      quality assurance (QA) in interstitial high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR‐iBT).
      The purpose of this study is to provide a concept for data acquisition developed 
      as part of a clinical evaluation study on the use of EMT during interstitial
      treatment of breast cancer patients. The stability, accuracy, and precision of
      EMT‐determined dwell positions were quantified. Dwell position reconstruction
      based on EMT was investigated on CT table, HDR table and PDR bed to examine the
      influence on precision and accuracy in a typical clinical workflow. All
      investigations were performed using a precise PMMA phantom. The track of
      catheters inserted in that phantom was measured by manually inserting a 5 degree 
      of freedom (DoF) sensor while recording the position of three 6DoF fiducial
      sensors on the phantom surface to correct motion influences. From the corrected
      data, dwell positions were reconstructed along the catheter's track. The accuracy
      of the EMT‐determined dwell positions was quantified by the residual distances to
      reference dwell positions after using a rigid registration. Precision and
      accuracy were investigated for different phantom‐table and sensor‐field generator
      (FG) distances. The measured precision of the EMT‐determined dwell positions was 
      ≤ 0.28 mm (95th percentile). Stability tests showed a drift of 0.03 mm in the
      first 20 min of use. Sudden shaking of the FG or (large) metallic objects close
      to the FG degrade the precision. The accuracy with respect to the reference dwell
      positions was on all clinical tables < 1 mm at 200 mm FG distance and 120 mm
      phantom‐table distance. Phantom measurements showed that EMT‐determined
      localization of dwell positions in HDR‐iBT is stable, precise, and sufficiently
      accurate for clinical assessment. The presented method may be viable for clinical
      applications in HDR‐iBT, like implant definition, error detection or
      quantification of uncertainties. Further clinical investigations are needed.

TI  - Algorithms for Prediction of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score using
      Clinicopathologic Data: A Review and Comparison using an Independent Dataset.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Purpose: Given the potential savings in cost and resource utilization, several
      algorithms have been proposed to predict Oncotype DX recurrence score (ODX RS)
      using commonly acquired histopathologic variables. Although promising, additional
      independent validation of these surrogate markers is needed prior to guiding
      patient management. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 305
      patients with invasive breast cancer at our institution that had ODX RS
      available. We selected five equations that provide a surrogate measure of ODX as 
      previously published by Klein et. al. (Magee equations 1-3), Gage et. al., and
      Tang et. al. All equations used estrogen receptor status and progesterone
      receptor status along with different combinations of grade, proliferation indices
      (Ki-67, mitotic rate), HER2 status, and tumor size. Results: Of all surrogate
      scores tested, the Magee equation 2 provided the highest correlation with ODX
      both with regards to raw score (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.66 95% CI
      0.59-0.72) and categorical correlation (Cohen’s kappa = 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). 
      Although Magee equation 2 provided a way to reliably identify high risk disease
      by assigning 95% of the patients with high ODX RS to either the intermediate or
      high risk group, it was unable to reliably identify the potential for patients to
      have intermediate or high risk disease by ODX (66% of such patients identified). 
      Conclusions: Although commonly available surrogates for ODX appear to predict
      high risk ODX RS, they are unable to reliably rule out the presence of patients
      with intermediate risk disease by ODX. Given the potential benefit of adjuvant
      chemotherapy in women with intermediate risk disease by ODX, current surrogates
      are unable to safely substitute for ODX. Characterizing the true recurrence risk 
      in patients with intermediate risk disease by ODX is critical to the clinical
      adoption of current surrogate markers and is an area of ongoing clinical trials.

TI  - Phase I dose escalation study of the PI3kinase pathway inhibitor BKM120 and the
      oral poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib for the treatment of 
      high-grade serous ovarian and breast cancer.
PG  - 512-8
AB  - Background: Based upon preclinical synergy in murine models, we carried out a
      phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicities,
      pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers of response for the combination of BKM120, a
      PI3K inhibitor, and olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. Patients and methods: Olaparib
      was administered twice daily (tablet formulation) and BKM120 daily on a 28-day
      cycle, both orally. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was employed with the primary 
      objective of defining the combination MTD, and secondary objectives were to
      define toxicities, activity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Eligibility included
      recurrent breast (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC); dose-expansion cohorts at the MTD
      were enrolled for each cancer. Results: In total, 69 of 70 patients enrolled
      received study treatment; one patient never received study treatment because of
      ineligibility. Twenty-four patients had BC; 46 patients had OC. Thirty-five
      patients had a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAm). Two DLTs (grade 3 transaminitis
      and hyperglycemia) were observed at DL0 (BKM120 60 mg/olaparib and 100 mg
      b.i.d.). The MTD was determined to be BKM120 50 mg q.d. and olaparib 300 mg
      b.i.d. (DL8). Additional DLTs included grade 3 depression and transaminitis,
      occurring early in cycle 2 (DL7). Anticancer activity was observed in BC and OC
      and in gBRCAm and gBRCA wild-type (gBRCAwt) patients. Conclusions: BKM120 and
      olaparib can be co-administered, but the combination requires attenuation of the 
      BKM120 dose. Clinical benefit was observed in both gBRCAm and gBRCAwt pts.
      Randomized phase II studies will be needed to further define the efficacy of
      PI3K/PARP-inhibitor combinations as compared with a PARP inhibitor alone.

TI  - Mammography rates after the 2009 revision to the United States Preventive
      Services Task Force breast cancer screening recommendation.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - Background: In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
      recommended against routine mammography screening for women aged 40–49 years.
      This revised recommendation was widely criticized and has sparked off intense
      debate. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the revised
      recommendation on the proportion of women receiving mammograms and how the effect
      varied by age. Methods: We identified women who had continuous health insurance
      coverage and who did not have breast cancer between 2008 and 2011 in the Truven
      Health MarketScan Commercial Claims Databases using mammogram procedure codes.
      Using women aged 50–59 years as a control group, we used a
      differences-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of the revised
      recommendation on the proportion of women ages 40–49 years who received at least 
      one mammogram. We also compared the age-specific changes in the proportion of
      women ages 35–59 years who were screened before and after the release of the
      revised recommendation. Results: The proportion of women screened among the 40–49
      and 50–59 age groups were 58.5 and 62.5%, respectively, between 2008 and 2009,
      and 56.9 and 62.0%, respectively, between 2010 and 2011. After 2009, the
      proportion of women screened declined by 1.2 percentage point among women aged
      40–49 years (P < 0.01). The proportion of women screened decreased for all ages, 
      and decreases were larger among women closer to the 40-year threshold.
      Conclusions: The 2009 USPSTF breast cancer recommendation was followed by a small
      reduction in the proportion of insured women aged 40–49 years who were screened. 
      Reductions were larger among women at the younger end of the age range, who
      presumably had less prior experience with mammography than women nearing 50.

TI  - An Antiestrogenic Activity Score for tamoxifen and its metabolites is associated 
      with breast cancer outcome.
PG  - 567-74
AB  - Purpose: Endoxifen concentrations have been associated with breast cancer
      recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients. However, tamoxifen itself and other
      metabolites also show antiestrogenic anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to develop a comprehensive Antiestrogenic Activity Score (AAS),
      which accounts for concentration and antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen and
      three metabolites. An association between the AAS and recurrence-free survival
      was investigated and compared to a previously published threshold for endoxifen
      concentrations of 5.97 ng/mL. Patients and methods: The antiestrogenic activities
      of tamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen, and N-desmethyltamoxifen
      were determined in a cell proliferation assay. The AAS was determined by
      calculating the sum of each metabolite concentration multiplied by an IC50 ratio,
      relative to tamoxifen. The AAS was calculated for 1370 patients with estrogen
      receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer. An association between AAS and
      recurrence was investigated using Cox regression and compared with the 5.97 ng/mL
      endoxifen threshold using concordance indices. Results: An AAS threshold of 1798 
      was associated with recurrence-free survival, hazard ratio (HR) 0.67 (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.47–0.96), bias corrected after bootstrap HR 0.69 (95% 
      CI 0.48–0.99). The concordance indices for AAS and endoxifen did not
      significantly differ; however, using the AAS threshold instead of endoxifen led
      to different dose recommendations for 5.2% of the patients. Conclusions:
      Endoxifen concentrations can serve as a proxy for the antiestrogenic effect of
      tamoxifen and metabolites. However, for the aggregate effect of tamoxifen and
      three metabolites, defined by an integrative algorithm, a trend towards improving
      treatment is seen and moreover, is significantly associated with breast cancer
      recurrence.

TI  - Discordance between Original and Central Laboratories in ER and HER2 Results in a
      Diverse, Population-Based Sample.
PG  - 375-84
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the discordance between original and central laboratories
      in estrogen receptor (ER) status, in tumors originally deemed to be ER-negative, 
      and in HER2 status in a diverse population-based sample. Methods: In a follow up 
      study of 1785 women with Stage I–III breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 – 2007 
      in the Detroit and Los Angeles County SEER registry catchment areas, participants
      were asked to consent to reassessment of ER (in tumors originally deemed to be
      ER-negative) and HER2 status on archival tumor samples approximately four years
      after diagnosis. Specimens (either slides or blocks) were centrally prepared and 
      analyzed for ER and HER2 using standardized methods and the guidelines of the
      American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists.
      Analyses determined the discordance between original and central laboratories.
      Results: 132 (31%) of those eligible for ER reassessment and 367 (21%) eligible
      for HER2 reassessment had archival blocks reassessed centrally. ER discordance
      was only 6%. HER2 discordance by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 26%, but final
      HER2 results—employing FISH in tumors that were IHC 2+ at the central
      laboratory—were discordant in only 6%. Half of the original laboratories did not 
      perform their own assays. Conclusions: Discordance between original and central
      laboratories in two large metropolitan areas was low in this population-based
      sample compared to previously-reported patient samples. Centralization of testing
      for key pathology variables appears to be occurring in many hospitals. In
      addition, quality improvement efforts may have preceded the publication and
      dissemination of specialty society guidelines.

TI  - Development of a deep inspiration breath‐hold system for radiotherapy utilizing a
      laser distance measurer.
PG  - 260-4
AB  - Deep inspiration breath‐hold (DIBH) is a technique for treating left‐sided breast
      cancer (LSBC). In modern radiotherapy, one of the main aims is to exclude the
      heart from the beam aperture with an individualized beam design for LSBC. A deep 
      inhalation will raise the chest wall while the volume of the lungs increase, this
      will again push the heart away from the breast to be treated. There are a few
      commercial DIBH systems, both invasive and noninvasive. We present an alternative
      noninvasive DIBH system based upon an industrial laser distance measurer. This
      system can be installed in a treatment room at a low cost; it is very easy to use
      and requires limited amount of training for the personnel and the patient. The
      system is capable of measuring the position of the chest wall with high frequency
      and precision in real time. The patient views its breathing curve through video
      glasses, and gets instructions during the treatment session. The system is well
      tolerated by test subjects due to its noninvasiveness.

TI  - Lgr6 labels a rare population of mammary gland progenitor cells that are able to 
      originate luminal mammary tumours.
PG  - 1346-56
AB  - The mammary gland is composed of a complex cellular hierarchy with unusual
      postnatal plasticity. The identities of stem/progenitor cell populations, as well
      as tumour-initiating cells that give rise to breast cancer, are incompletely
      understood. Here we show that Lgr6 marks rare populations of cells in both basal 
      and luminal mammary gland compartments in mice. Lineage tracing analysis showed
      that Lgr6+ cells are unipotent progenitors, which expand clonally during puberty 
      but diminish in adulthood. In pregnancy or upon stimulation with ovarian
      hormones, adult Lgr6+ cells regained proliferative potency and their progeny
      formed alveoli over repeated pregnancies. Oncogenic mutations in Lgr6+ cells
      resulted in expansion of luminal cells, culminating in mammary gland tumours.
      Conversely, depletion of Lgr6+ cells in the MMTV-PyMT model of mammary
      tumourigenesis significantly impaired tumour growth. Thus, Lgr6 marks mammary
      gland progenitor cells that can initiate tumours, and cells of luminal breast
      tumours required for efficient tumour maintenance.

TI  - Intrinsic Subtype and Therapeutic Response Among HER2-Positive Breast Tumors from
      the NCCTG (Alliance) N9831 Trial.
LID - djw207
AB  - Background: Genomic data from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive
      (HER2+) tumors were analyzed to assess the association between intrinsic subtype 
      and clinical outcome in a large, well-annotated patient cohort.Methods: Samples
      from the NCCTG (Alliance) N9831 trial were analyzed using the Prosigna algorithm 
      on the NanoString platform to define intrinsic subtype, risk of recurrence
      scores, and risk categories for 1392 HER2+ tumors. Subtypes were evaluated for
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox model analysis
      following adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 484) or chemotherapy plus trastuzumab
      (n = 908). All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Patients with HER2+
      tumors from N9831 were primarily scored as HER2-enriched (72.1%). These
      individuals received statistically significant benefit from trastuzumab (hazard
      ratio [HR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 0.89, P = .005), as did
      the patients (291 of 1392) with luminal-type tumors (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.32 to 
      0.85, P = .01). Patients with basal-like tumors (97 of 1392) did not have
      statistically significantly better RFS when treated with trastuzumab and
      chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.53 to 2.13, 
      P = .87).Conclusions: The majority of clinically defined HER2-positive tumors
      were classified as HER2-enriched or luminal using the Prosigna algorithm.
      Intrinsic subtype alone cannot replace conventional histopathological evaluation 
      of HER2 status because many tumors that are classified as luminal A or luminal B 
      will benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab if that subtype is accompanied by HER2
      overexpression. However, among tumors that overexpress HER2, we speculate that
      assessment of intrinsic subtype may influence treatment, particularly with
      respect to evaluating alternative therapeutic approaches for that subset of
      HER2-positive tumors of the basal-like subtype.

TI  - Continuous measurement of breast tumor hormone receptor expression: a comparison 
      of two computational pathology platforms.
PG  - 428-34
AB  - Background: Computational pathology platforms incorporate digital microscopy with
      sophisticated image analysis to permit rapid, continuous measurement of protein
      expression. We compared two computational pathology platforms on their
      measurement of breast tumor estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)
      expression. Methods: Breast tumor microarrays from the Nurses’ Health Study were 
      stained for ER (n=592) and PR (n=187). One expert pathologist scored cases as
      positive if ≥1% of tumor nuclei exhibited stain. ER and PR were then measured
      with the Definiens Tissue Studio (automated) and Aperio Digital Pathology
      (user-supervised) platforms. Platform-specific measurements were compared using
      boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation statistics. Classification of ER and PR 
      positivity by platform-specific measurements was evaluated with areas under
      receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) from univariable logistic
      regression models, using expert pathologist classification as the standard.
      Results: Both platforms showed considerable overlap in continuous measurements of
      ER and PR between positive and negative groups classified by expert pathologist. 
      Platform-specific measurements were strongly and positively correlated with one
      another (rho≥0.77). The user-supervised Aperio workflow performed slightly better
      than the automated Definiens workflow at classifying ER positivity
      (AUCAperio=0.97; AUCDefiniens=0.90; difference=0.07, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.09) and PR
      positivity (AUCAperio=0.94; AUCDefiniens=0.87; difference=0.07, 95% CI: 0.03,
      0.12). Conclusion: Paired hormone receptor expression measurements from two
      different computational pathology platforms agreed well with one another. The
      user-supervised workflow yielded better classification accuracy than the
      automated workflow. Appropriately validated computational pathology algorithms
      enrich molecular epidemiology studies with continuous protein expression data and
      may accelerate tumor biomarker discovery.

TI  - Clinical and therapeutic relevance of the metabolic oncogene fatty acid synthase 
      in HER2+ breast cancer.
PG  - 687-98
AB  - Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key lipogenic enzyme for de novo fatty acid
      biosynthesis and a druggable metabolic oncoprotein that is activated in most
      human cancers. We evaluated whether the HER2-driven lipogenic phenotype might
      represent a biomarker for sensitivity to pharmacological FASN blockade. A
      majority of clinically HER2-positive tumors were scored as FASN overexpressors in
      a series of almost 200 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Re-classification
      of HER2-positive breast tumors based on FASN gene expression predicted a
      significantly inferior relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival in
      HER2+/FASN+ patients. Notably, non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells
      engineered to overexpress HER2 upregulated FASN gene expression, and the FASN
      inhibitor C75 abolished HER2-induced anchorage-independent growth and survival.
      Furthermore, in the presence of high concentrations of C75, HER2-negative MCF-7
      breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 (MCF-7/HER2) had significantly higher
      levels of apoptosis than HER2-negative cells. Finally, C75 at non-cytotoxic
      concentrations significantly reduced the capacity of MCF-7/HER2 cells to form
      mammospheres, an in vitro indicator of cancer stem-like cells. Collectively, our 
      findings strongly suggest that the HER2-FASN lipogenic axis delineates a group of
      breast cancer patients that might benefit from treatment with therapeutic
      regimens containing FASN inhibitors.

TI  - Equivalent survival after nipple-sparing compared to non-nipple-sparing
      mastectomy: data from California, 1988–2013.
PG  - 333-8
AB  - Purpose: Nipple-sparing mastectomy, which may improve cosmesis, body image, and
      sexual function in comparison to non-nipple-sparing mastectomy, is increasingly
      used to treat early-stage breast cancer; however, long-term survival data are
      lacking. We evaluated survival after nipple-sparing mastectomy versus
      non-nipple-sparing mastectomy in a population-based cancer registry. Methods: We 
      conducted an observational study using the California Cancer Registry,
      considering all stage 0–III breast cancers diagnosed in California from 1988 to
      2013. We compared breast cancer-specific and overall survival time after
      nipple-sparing versus non-nipple-sparing mastectomy, using multivariable
      analysis. Results: Among 157,592 stage 0–III female breast cancer patients
      treated with unilateral mastectomy from 1988–2013, 993 (0.6 %) were reported as
      having nipple-sparing and 156,599 (99.4 %) non-nipple-sparing mastectomies;
      median follow-up was 7.9 years. The proportion of mastectomies that were
      nipple-sparing increased over time (1988, 0.2 %; 2013, 5.1 %) and with
      neighborhood socioeconomic status, and decreased with age and stage. On
      multivariable analysis, nipple-sparing mastectomy was associated with a lower
      risk of breast cancer-specific mortality compared to non-nipple-sparing
      mastectomy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.98].
      However, when restricting to diagnoses 1996 or later and adjusting for a larger
      set of covariates, risk was attenuated (HR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.52–1.42). Conclusions:
      Among California breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1988–2013, nipple-sparing 
      mastectomy was not associated with worse survival than non-nipple-sparing
      mastectomy. These results may inform the decisions of patients and doctors
      deliberating between these surgical approaches for breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Characteristics of quantitative perfusion parameters on dynamic contrast‐enhanced
      MRI in mammographically occult breast cancer.
PG  - 377-90
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics of quantitative
      perfusion parameters obtained from dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with mammographically occult (MO) breast
      cancers and those with mammographically visible (MV) breast cancers. Quantitative
      parameters (AUC, Ktrans,kep,ve,vp, and wi) from 13 MO breast cancers and 16 MV
      breast cancers were mapped after the DCE‐MRI data were acquired. Various
      prognostic factors, including axillary nodal status, estrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PR), Ki‐67, p53, E‐cadherin, and human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) were obtained in each group. Fisher's exact test was
      used to compare any differences of the various prognostic factors between the two
      groups. The Mann‐Whitney U test was applied to compare the quantitative
      parameters between these two groups. Finally, Spearman's correlation was used to 
      investigate the relationships between perfusion indices and four factors — age,
      tumor size, Ki‐67, and p53 — for each group. Although age, tumor size, and the
      prognostic factors were not statistically different between the two groups, the
      mean values of the quantitative parameters, except wi in the MV group, were
      higher than those in the MO group without statistical significance (p=0.219). The
      kep value was significantly different between the two groups (p=0.048), but the
      other parameters were not. In the MO group, vp with size, ve with p53, and Ktrans
      and vp with Ki‐67 had significant correlations (p<0.05). However, in the MV
      group, only kep showed significant correlation with age. The kep value was only
      the perfusion parameter of statistical significance between MO and MV breast
      cancers.PACS number(s): 87.19.U‐, 87.61.‐c

PG  - 534-41
AB  - Monitoring and controlling respiratory motion is a challenge for the accuracy and
      safety of therapeutic irradiation of thoracic tumors. Various commercial systems 
      based on the monitoring of internal or external surrogates have been developed
      but remain costly. In this article we describe and validate Madibreast, an
      in‐house‐made respiratory monitoring and processing device based on optical
      tracking of external markers. We designed an optical apparatus to ensure
      real‐time submillimetric image resolution at 4 m. Using OpenCv libraries, we
      optically tracked high‐contrast markers set on patients' breasts. Validation of
      spatial and time accuracy was performed on a mechanical phantom and on human
      breast. Madibreast was able to track motion of markers up to a 5 cm/s speed, at a
      frame rate of 30 fps, with submillimetric accuracy on mechanical phantom and
      human breasts. Latency was below 100 ms. Concomitant monitoring of three
      different locations on the breast showed discrepancies in axial motion up to 4 mm
      for deep‐breathing patterns. This low‐cost, computer‐vision system for real‐time 
      motion monitoring of the irradiation of breast cancer patients showed
      submillimetric accuracy and acceptable latency. It allowed the authors to
      highlight differences in surface motion that may be correlated to tumor
      motion.PACS number(s): 87.55.km

TI  - Surface imaging, laser positioning or volumetric imaging for breast cancer with
      nodal involvement treated by helical TomoTherapy.
PG  - 200-11
AB  - A surface imaging system, Catalyst (C‐Rad), was compared with laser‐based
      positioning and daily mega voltage computed tomography (MVCT) setup for breast
      patients with nodal involvement treated by helical TomoTherapy. Catalyst‐based
      positioning performed better than laser‐based positioning. The respective
      modalities resulted in a standard deviation (SD), 68% confidence interval (CI) of
      positioning of left–right, craniocaudal, anterior–posterior, roll: 2.4 mm, 2.7
      mm, 2.4 mm, 0.9° for Catalyst positioning, and 6.1 mm, 3.8 mm, 4.9 mm, 1.1° for
      laser‐based positioning, respectively. MVCT‐based precision is a combination of
      the interoperator variability for MVCT fusion and the patient movement during the
      time it takes for MVCT and fusion. The MVCT fusion interoperator variability for 
      breast patients was evaluated at one SD left–right, craniocaudal, ant–post, roll 
      as: 1.4 mm, 1.8 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.0°.There was no statistically significant
      difference between the automatic MVCT registration result and the manual
      adjustment; the automatic fusion results were within the 95% CI of the mean
      result of 10 users, except for one specific case where the patient was positioned
      with large yaw. We found that users add variability to the roll correction as the
      automatic registration was more consistent.The patient position uncertainty
      confidence interval was evaluated as 1.9 mm, 2.2 mm, 1.6 mm, 0.9° after 4 min,
      and 2.3 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.2 mm, 1° after 10 min. The combination of this patient
      movement with MVCT fusion interoperator variability results in total standard
      deviations of patient position when treatment starts 4 or 10 min after initial
      positioning of, respectively: 2.3 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.3° and 2.7 mm, 3.3 mm,
      2.6 mm, 1.4°.Surface based positioning arrives at the same precision when taking 
      into account the time required for MVCT imaging and fusion. These results can be 
      used on a patient‐per‐patient basis to decide which positioning system performs
      the best after the first 5 fractions and when daily MVCT can be omitted. Ideally,
      real‐time monitoring is required to reduce important intrafraction movement.PACS

TI  - Evaluation of cassette‐based digital radiography detectors using standardized
      image quality metrics: AAPM TG‐150 Draft Image Detector Tests.
PG  - 391-417
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate several of the standardized image
      quality metrics proposed by the American Association of Physics in Medicine
      (AAPM) Task Group 150. The task group suggested region‐of‐interest (ROI)‐based
      techniques to measure nonuniformity, minimum signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR), number 
      of anomalous pixels, and modulation transfer function (MTF). This study evaluated
      the effects of ROI size and layout on the image metrics by using four different
      ROI sets, assessed result uncertainty by repeating measurements, and compared
      results with two commercially available quality control tools, namely the
      Carestream DIRECTVIEW Total Quality Tool (TQT) and the GE Healthcare Quality
      Assurance Process (QAP). Seven Carestream DRX‐1C (CsI) detectors on mobile DR
      systems and four GE FlashPad detectors in radiographic rooms were tested. Images 
      were analyzed using MATLAB software that had been previously validated and
      reported. Our values for signal and SNR nonuniformity and MTF agree with values
      published by other investigators. Our results show that ROI size affects
      nonuniformity and minimum SNR measurements, but not detection of anomalous
      pixels. Exposure geometry affects all tested image metrics except for the MTF.
      TG‐150 metrics in general agree with the TQT, but agree with the QAP only for
      local and global signal nonuniformity. The difference in SNR nonuniformity and
      MTF values between the TG‐150 and QAP may be explained by differences in the
      calculation of noise and acquisition beam quality, respectively. TG‐150's SNR
      nonuniformity metrics are also more sensitive to detector nonuniformity compared 
      to the QAP. Our results suggest that fixed ROI size should be used for
      consistency because nonuniformity metrics depend on ROI size. Ideally, detector
      tests should be performed at the exact calibration position. If not feasible, a
      baseline should be established from the mean of several repeated measurements.
      Our study indicates that the TG‐150 tests can be used as an independent
      standardized procedure for detector performance assessment.PACS number(s):

TI  - Multiplexed imaging reveals heterogeneity of PI3K/MAPK network signaling in
      breast lesions of known PIK3CA genotype.
PG  - 575-83
AB  - Purpose: Activating genetic changes in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
      signaling pathway are found in over half of invasive breast cancers (IBC).
      Previously, we discovered numerous hotspot PIK3CA mutations in proliferative
      breast lesions. Here, we investigate the spatial nature of PI3K pathway signaling
      and its relationship with PI3K genotype in breast lesions. Methods: We identified
      PI3K phosphosignaling network signatures in columnar cell change (CCL), usual
      ductal hyperplasia (UDH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC in 29 lesions
      of known PIK3CA genotype from 10 human breast specimens using a
      hyperspectral-based multiplexed tissue imaging platform (MTIP) to simultaneously 
      quantitate PI3K/MAPK pathway targets (pAKT473, pAKT308, pPRAS40, pS6, and pERK)
      in FFPE tissue, with single cell resolution. Results: We found that breast
      lesional epithelia contained spatially heterogeneous patterns of PI3K pathway
      phosphoprotein signatures, even within microscopic areas of CCL, UDH, DCIS and
      IBC. Most lesions contained 3–12 unique phosphoprotein signatures within the same
      microscopic field. The dominant phosphoprotein signature for each lesion was not 
      well-correlated with lesion genotype or lesion histology, yet samples from the
      same patient tended to group together. Further, 5 UDH/CCL lesions across
      different patients had a common phosphosignature at the epithelial-stromal
      interface (possible myoepithelial cells) that was distinct from both the adjacent
      lesional epithelium, and distinct from adjacent stroma. Conclusion: We present
      the first spatial mapping of PI3K phosphoprotein networks in proliferative breast
      lesions, and demonstrate complex PI3K signaling heterogeneity that defies simple 
      correlation between PIK3CA genotype and phosphosignal pattern.

TI  - HALT-D: A Phase II Evaluation of Crofelemer for the Prevention and Prophylaxis of
      Diarrhea in Patients With Breast Cancer on Pertuzumab-Based Regimens.
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Approximately 40% to 80% of patients receiving pertuzumab-directed therapy for
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer will
      develop chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID). Loperamide and octreotide are
      frequently used to treat CID after diarrhea occurs, but neither is used
      prophylactically or targets the underlying mechanism. Previous studies suggest
      blocking epidermal growth factor receptor may cause excess chloride secretion,
      resulting in diarrhea. Crofelemer is derived from the red latex of the Croton
      lechleri tree, blocks gastrointestinal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
      and calcium-activated chloride channels, and is U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      approved for relief of diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients on anti-retroviral therapy. 
      Crofelemer is not systemically absorbed, has relatively few side effects, and
      presents a targeted approach at preventing CID in patients receiving
      pertuzumab-based therapy. HALT-D (DiarrHeA Prevention and ProphyLaxis with
      Crofelemer in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Trastuzumab,
      Pertuzumab, and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel with or without Carboplatin, NCT02910219)
      is a phase II, randomized, open-label trial that aims to recruit 46 patients from
      3 MedStar sites. Adults with HER2-positive breast cancer being treated with
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel or paclitaxel (THP) or trastuzumab,
      pertuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin (TCHP) will be randomized to receive
      crofelemer or no medication for diarrhea prophylaxis. The primary endpoint is
      incidence of all grade diarrhea for ≥ 2 consecutive days during cycles 1 to 2 of 
      THP or TCHP. Secondary endpoints include overall incidence, duration, and
      severity of diarrhea; time to onset of diarrhea; use of other anti-diarrheal
      medications; stool frequency and consistency; and quality of life. HALT-D will
      provide important information about the feasibility and tolerability of
      crofelemer in preventing diarrhea for patients receiving THP or TCHP.

TI  - Body fatness throughout the life course and the incidence of premenopausal breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1103-12
AB  - Background: The role of body fatness in the aetiology of breast cancer is
      complex. We evaluated the independent and synergistic effects of body fatness, at
      different stages throughout a woman's life course, on premenopausal breast cancer
      risk.Methods: Premenopausal participants of the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII)
      were followed from 1991 up to 2009. Body fatness factors including birthweight,
      somatotype (a 9-level pictogram with level 1 being the leanest) at ages 5 and 10 
      years and body mass index (BMI) at age 18 were collected at baseline. Current BMI
      was updated biennially. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate 
      the association between each body fatness factor as well as cross-classification 
      of all factors and the incidence of breast cancer.Results: Based on 1574 incident
      premenopausal breast cancer cases and 1 133 893 person-years of follow-up, a
      lower incidence was associated with lower birthweight: hazard ratio (HR) [95%
      confidence interval (CI)] = 0.74 (0.58–0.95) for <2.5kg vs 3.9+kg, P for trend < 
      0.001; higher somatotype at age 5: HR=0.57 (95% CI 0.44–0.73) for 5–9 vs 1, P
      fortrend < 0.0001]; and at age 10: HR=0.61 (95% CI 0.49–0.75) for 5–9 vs 1, P for
      trend < 0.0001]; and BMI at age 18: HR=0.67 (95% 0.47–0.95) for ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 vs <
      18.5 kg/m2, P for trend = 0.009], after adjusting for age and body fatness
      measures earlier in life and other risk factors, respectively. No significant
      interaction between body fatness measures was found. Women with the lowest
      birthweight, the highest somatotype at ages 5 and 10 and the highest BMI at age
      18 and currently had a 72% (95% CI 54%-83%) lower incidence of invasive
      premenopausal breast cancer than women with the opposite extreme of each body
      fatness indicator.Conclusion: The lowest incidence of premenopausal breast cancer
      was associated with the lowest birthweight and the highest childhood, adolescent 
      and early adult body fatness.

TI  - Evaluation of target and cardiac position during visually monitored deep
      inspiration breath‐hold for breast radiotherapy.
PG  - 25-36
AB  - A low‐resource visually monitored deep inspiration breath‐hold (VM‐DIBH)
      technique was successfully implemented in our clinic to reduce cardiac dose in
      left‐sided breast radiotherapy. In this study, we retrospectively characterized
      the chest wall and heart positioning accuracy of VM‐DIBH using cine portal images
      from 42 patients. Central chest wall position from field edge and in‐field
      maximum heart distance (MHD) were manually measured on cine images and compared
      to the planned positions based on the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs).
      An in‐house program was designed to measure left anterior descending artery (LAD)
      and chest wall separation on the planning DIBH CT scan with respect to
      breath‐hold level (BHL) during simulation to determine a minimum BHL for VM‐DIBH 
      eligibility. Systematic and random setup uncertainties of 3.0 mm and 2.6 mm,
      respectively, were found for VM‐DIBH treatment from the chest wall measurements. 
      Intrabeam breath‐hold stability was found to be good, with over 96% of delivered 
      fields within 3 mm. Average treatment MHD was significantly larger for those
      patients where some of the heart was planned in the field compared to patients
      whose heart was completely shielded in the plan (p < 0.001). No evidence for a
      minimum BHL was found, suggesting that all patients who can tolerate DIBH may
      yield a benefit from it.PACS number(s): 87.53.Jw, 87.53.Kn, 87.55.D‐

TI  - The Neo-Bioscore Update for Staging Breast Cancer Treated With Neoadjuvant
      Chemotherapy: Incorporation of Prognostic Biologic Factors Into Staging After
      Treatment.
PG  - 929-36
AB  - IMPORTANCE: We previously described and validated a breast cancer staging system 
      (CPS+EG, clinical-pathologic scoring system incorporating estrogen
      receptor–negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology) for assessing
      prognosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using pretreatment clinical stage,
      posttreatment pathologic stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and grade.
      Development of the CPS+EG staging system predated routine administration of
      trastuzumab in patients with ERBB2-positive disease (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu). 
      OBJECTIVE: To validate the CPS+EG staging system using the new definition of ER
      positivity (≥1%) and to develop an updated staging system (Neo-Bioscore) that
      incorporates ERBB2 status into the previously developed CPS+EG. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of data collected prospectively from
      January 2005 through December 2012 on patients with breast cancer treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Prognostic scores were computed using 2 versions of
      the CPS+EG staging system, one with ER considered positive if it measured 10% or 
      higher, the other with ER considered positive if it measured 1% or higher. Fits
      of the Cox proportional hazards model for the 2 sets of prognostic scores were
      compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Status of ERBB2 was added 
      to the model, and the likelihood ratio test was used to determine improvement in 
      fit. RESULTS: A total of 2377 patients were included; all were women (median age,
      50 years [range, 21-87 years]); ER status was less than 1% in 28.9%, 1% to 9% in 
      8.3%, and 10% or higher in 62.8%; 591 patients were ERBB2 positive. Median
      follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.5-11.7 years). Five-year disease-specific
      survival was 89% (95% CI, 87%-90%). Using 1% or higher as the cutoff for ER
      positivity, 5-year disease-specific survival estimates determined using the
      CPS+EG stage ranged from 52% to 98%, thereby validating our previous finding that
      the CPS+EG score facilitates more refined categorization into prognostic
      subgroups than clinical or final pathologic stage alone. The AIC value for this
      model was 3333.06, while for a model using 10% or higher as the cutoff for ER
      positivity, it was 3333.38, indicating that the model fits were nearly identical.
      The improvement in fit of the model when ERBB2 status was added was highly
      significant, with 5-year disease-specific survival estimates ranging from 48% to 
      99% (P < .001). Incorporating ERBB2 into the staging system defined the
      Neo-Bioscore, which provided improved stratification of patients with respect to 
      prognosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Neo-Bioscore improves our previously
      validated staging system and allows its application in ERBB2-positive patients.
      We recommend that treatment response and biologic markers be incorporated into
      the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.

TI  - Effect of Body Mass Index– and Actual Weight– Based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
      Doses on Pathologic Complete Response in Operable Breast Cancer.
PG  - 480-6
AB  - The effect of body mass index (BMI) on pathologic complete response (pCR)
      accounting for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) dose reductions remains undefined. 
      In 171 patients with operable breast cancer who received NAC, those with a BMI of
      ≥25 were less likely to tolerate uncapped taxane doses. Any chemotherapy dose
      reduction resulted in greater odds of not attaining a pCR in obese patients,
      independent of known predictors.Introduction: The effect of body mass index (BMI)
      and chemotherapy dose reduction on pathologic complete response (pCR) after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locoregional breast cancer remains unclear.
      Contemporary studies have reported largely on trial populations and used
      dose-capping. Patients and Methods: Patient registries at the University of Iowa 
      were queried to identify patients with operable breast cancer who received NAC.
      Dose reductions were calculated for taxanes (T), anthracyclines (A) and non–A-T
      chemotherapy. Clinical-pathologic characteristics, chemotherapy dose reductions, 
      and adverse events were compared between normal (BMI <25) and overweight/obese
      patients (BMI ≥25). Additionally, the synergistic effect of BMI and chemotherapy 
      dose reduction on pCR was assessed. Results: Of 171 eligible patients, 112 were
      overweight/obese. Chemotherapy dosing was capped in 2 patients; all others
      initiated full weight-based treatment. Overweight/obese patients required more
      frequent taxane (44.6% vs. 25.4%; P = .01) and any chemotherapy dose reductions
      (50.9% vs. 33.9%; P = .03). pCR was attained in 29.2% of patients. In a
      multivariable model, the interaction term for BMI as a continuous variable and
      any chemotherapy dose reduction was significant independent of the clinical stage
      and tumor receptor status (P = .04). For obese patients, any chemotherapy dose
      reduction was significantly associated with increased odds of not attaining pCR. 
      Conclusion: During NAC, overweight/obese patients more often have chemotherapy
      dose reductions. Chemotherapy dose reduction in obese patients was a powerful
      predictor of not attaining pCR. This was not seen for normal or overweight
      patients. Opportunities might exist to improve pCR rates in this higher-risk
      group.

TI  - Transcriptomic profiling of curcumin treated human breast stem cells identifies a
      role for stearoyl coa-desaturase in breast cancer prevention.
PG  - 29-41
AB  - Curcumin is a potential agent for both the prevention and treatment of cancers.
      Curcumin treatment alone, or in combination with piperine, limits breast stem
      cell self-renewal while remaining non-toxic to normal differentiated cells. We
      paired fluorescence activated cell sorting with RNA sequencing to characterize
      the genome-wide changes induced specifically in normal breast stem cells
      following treatment with these compounds. We generated genome-wide maps of the
      transcriptional changes that occur in epithelial-like (ALDH+) and
      mesenchymal-like (ALDH−/CD44+/CD24−) normal breast stem/progenitor cells
      following treatment with curcumin and piperine. We show that curcumin targets
      both stem cell populations by down-regulating expression of breast stem cell
      genes including ALDH1A3, CD49f, PROM1, and TP63. We also identified novel genes
      and pathways targeted by curcumin, including downregulation of SCD. Transient
      siRNA knockdown of SCD in MCF10A cells significantly inhibited mammosphere
      formation and the mean proportion of CD44+/CD24− cells, suggesting that SCD is a 
      regulator of breast stemness and a target of curcumin in breast stem cells. These
      findings extend previous reports of curcumin targeting stem cells, here in two
      phenotypically distinct stem/progenitor populations isolated from normal human
      breast tissue. We identified novel mechanisms by which curcumin and piperine
      target breast stem cell self-renewal, such as by targeting lipid metabolism,
      providing a mechanistic link between curcumin treatment and stem cell self
      renewal. These results elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin may act as a
      cancer preventive compound and provide novel targets for cancer prevention and
      treatment.

TI  - Breast Cancer Screening Among Women with Medicaid, 2006–2008: a Multilevel
      Analysis.
PG  - 446-54
AB  - Introduction: Nationally, about one third of women with breast cancer (BC) are
      diagnosed at late stage, which might be reduced with greater utilization of BC
      screening. The purpose of this paper is to examine the predictors of BC
      mammography use among women with Medicaid, and differences among Medicaid
      beneficiaries in their propensity to use mammography. Methods: The sample
      included 2,450,527 women drawn from both fee-for-service and managed care
      Medicaid claims from 25 states, during 2006–2008. The authors used multilevel
      modeling of predictors at person, county, and state levels of influence and
      examined traditional factors affecting access and the expanded scope of practice 
      allowed for the nurse practitioner (NP) in some states to provide primary care
      independent of physician oversight. Results: Black [OR = 0.87; 95 % CI
      (0.87–0.88)] and American Indian women [OR = 0.74; 95 % CI (0.71–0.76)] had lower
      odds ratio of mammography use than white women, while Hispanic [OR = 1.06; 95 %
      CI (1.05–1.07)] had higher odds ratio of mammography use than white women. Living
      in counties with higher Hispanic residential segregation [OR = 1.16; 95 % CI
      (1.10–1.23)] was associated with a higher odds ratio of mammography use compared 
      to areas with low Hispanic residential segregation, whereas living among more
      segregated black [OR = 0.78; 95 % CI (0.75–0.81)] or Asian [OR = 0.19; 95 % CI
      (0.17–0.21)] communities had lower odds ratio compared to areas with low
      segregation. Holding constant statistically the perceived shortage of MDs, which 
      was associated with significantly lower mammography use, the NP regulatory
      variable [OR = 1.03; 95 % CI (1.01–1.07)] enhanced the odds ratio of mammography 
      use among women in the six states with expanded scope of practice, compared with 
      women residing in 19 more restrictive states. Conclusions: Racial and ethnic
      disparities exist in the use of mammography among Medicaid-insured women. More
      expansive NP practice privileges in states are associated with higher
      utilization, and may help reduce rural disparities.

TI  - Protective Effect of Aerobic Physical Activity on Sleep Behavior in Breast Cancer
      Survivors.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Hypotheses. Sleep disorders are associated with an increased risk of cancer,
      including breast cancer (BC). Physical activity (PA) can produce beneficial
      effects on sleep. Study design. We designed a randomized controlled trial to test
      the effect of 3 months of physical activity on sleep and circadian rhythm
      activity level evaluated by actigraphy. Methods. 40 BC women, aged 35-70 years,
      were randomized into an intervention (IG) and a control group (CG). IG performed 
      a 3 month of aerobic exercise. At baseline and after 3 months, the following
      parameters were evaluated both for IG and CG: anthropometric and body composition
      measurements, energy expenditure and motion level; sleep parameters (Actual Sleep
      Time-AST, Actual Wake Time-AWT, Sleep Efficiency-SE, Sleep Latency-SL, Mean
      Activity Score-MAS, Movement and Fragmentation Index-MFI and Immobility Time-IT) 
      and activity level circadian rhythm using the Actigraph Actiwatch. Results. The
      CG showed a deterioration of sleep, whereas the IG showed a stable pattern. In
      the CG the SE, AST and IT decreased and the AWT, SL, MAS and MFI increased. In
      the IG, the SE, IT, AWT, SL, and MAS showed no changes and AST and MFI showed a
      less pronounced change in the IG than in the CG. The rhythmometric analysis
      revealed a significant circadian rhythm in two groups. After 3 months of PA, IG
      showed reduced fat mass %, while CG had improved weight and BMI. Conclusion.
      Physical activity may be beneficial against sleep disruption. Indeed, PA
      prevented sleep worsening in IG. PA can represent an integrative intervention
      therapy able to modify sleep behaviour.

TI  - Effects of a Community-Based Multimodal Exercise Program on Health-Related
      Physical Fitness and Physical Function in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 446-54
AB  - Purpose. Breast cancer and oncological treatment can result in significant acute 
      and late localized and systemic negative effects on health-related physical
      fitness and physical function. The aim of this single-arm study was to examine
      the effects of a 12-week community-based multimodal exercise program on
      health-related physical fitness and physical function in breast cancer survivors.
      Methods. A total of 52 female breast cancer survivors (mean age = 59.7 ± 10.4
      years) completed supervised exercise training consisting of (1) aerobic
      conditioning, (2) resistance training, and (3) balance and flexibility training, 
      for 30 minutes each, totaling 90 minutes twice weekly for 12 weeks. Pretreatment 
      and posttreatment outcome measures—mobility: (1) Timed Up and Go (TUG) and (2)
      6-minute walk test (6MWT); muscular strength: (3) leg press strength and (4)
      chest press strength; upper-extremity flexibility: (5) back scratch test; and
      balance: (6) functional reach (FR) and (7) single-leg stance time—were assessed
      and compared. Results. Postintervention assessment measures given as percentage
      improvement and effect size (ES) for mobility, TUG (18%, 0.59), and 6MWT (14%,
      0.74) were significantly (P < .001) improved. Outcome measures of muscular
      strength, leg press strength (32%, 0.58) and chest press strength (40%, 0.61),
      both significantly (P < .001) improved. Postintervention assessment measure of
      upper-extremity flexibility (42%, 0.41) showed significant (P < .001)
      improvements. Outcome measures for balance, FR (18%, 0.75) and single leg stance 
      time (24%, 0.30), showed significant (P < .001) improvements. Conclusions.
      Outcome measures showed moderate to large ES improvements after participants
      completed the 12-week multimodal exercise program for breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Initial Surgery and Survival in Stage IV Breast Cancer in the United States,
      1988–2011.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Management of the primary tumor site in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the patterns of
      receipt of initial breast surgery for female patients with stage IV breast cancer
      in the United States, with particular attention to women who survived at least 10
      years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study using data
      from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Female
      patients diagnosed as having stage IV breast cancer between 1988 and 2011 and who
      did not receive radiation therapy as part of the first course of treatment were
      included (N = 21 372). Kaplan-Meier estimates of median survival and descriptive 
      statistics were used to compare patient and tumor characteristics by receipt of
      breast surgery at diagnosis. A Royston-Parmar survival model and logistic
      regression analysis assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with
      survival and prolonged survival (of at least 10 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURES: Differences in survival, particularly survival of at least 10 years, by
      receipt of initial surgery to the primary tumor. RESULTS: Among the 21 372
      patients, the median survival increased from 20 months (1988–1991) to 26 months
      (2007–2011). During this time, the rate of surgery declined (odds ratio [OR],
      0.16; 95% CI, 0.12–0.21). Even so, receipt of surgery was associated with
      improved survival in multivariate analysis, which controlled for patient and
      clinical characteristics, along with time period (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI,
      0.57–0.63). For women diagnosed as having cancer before 2002 (n = 7504), survival
      of at least 10 years was seen in 9.6%(n = 353) and 2.9% (n = 107) of those who
      did and did not receive surgery, respectively (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.89–4.50). In
      multivariate analysis, survival of at least 10 years was associated with receipt 
      of surgery (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.08–3.77), hormone receptor–positive
      disease (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.25–2.48), older age (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32–0.54),
      larger tumor size (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.27–0.51), marital status of being
      separated at the time of diagnosis (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.88), and more recent
      year of diagnosis (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02–1.99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      Survival in stage IV breast cancer has improved and is increasingly of prolonged 
      duration, particularly for some women undergoing initial breast surgery. As
      systemic therapy advances provide better control of distant disease in stage IV
      breast cancer, and as women present with lower distant disease burdens, these
      findings on initial surgery to the primary tumor may be of importance.

TI  - Relationship Between Breast Density and Selective Estrogen-Receptor Modulators,
      Aromatase Inhibitors, Physical Activity, and Diet: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 127-44
AB  - Background. Lower breast density (BD) is associated with lower risk of breast
      cancer and may serve as a biomarker for the efficacy of chemopreventive
      strategies. This review explores parameters that are thought to be associated
      with lower BD. We conducted a systematic review of articles published to date
      using the PRISMA strategy. Articles that assessed change in BD with
      estrogen-receptor modulators (tamoxifene [TAM], raloxifene [RLX], and tibolone)
      and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal
      studies (LSs) that assessed association between BD and physical activity (PA) or 
      diet were reviewed. Results. Ten studies assessed change in BD with TAM; all
      reported TAM-mediated BD decreases. Change in BD with RLX was assessed by 11
      studies; 3 reported a reduction in BD. Effect of tibolone was assessed by 5 RCTs;
      only 1 reported change in BD. AI-mediated BD reduction was reported by 3 out of
      10 studies. The association between PA and BD was assessed by 21 studies; 4
      reported an inverse association. The relationship between diet and BD was
      assessed in 34 studies. All studies on calcium and vitamin D as well as vegetable
      intake reported an inverse association with BD in premenopausal women. Two RCTs
      demonstrated BD reduction with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate intervention.
      Conclusion. TAM induces BD reduction; however, the effect of RLX, tibolone, and
      AIs on BD is unclear. Although data on association between diet and BD in
      adulthood are contradictory, intake of vegetables, vitamin D, and calcium appear 
      to be associated with lower BD in premenopausal women.

      biopsy under intracardiac echocardiography guidance.
LID - bcr2016215146
AB  - Precise diagnosis of intracardiac masses is fundamental to their treatment.
      However, the findings of non-invasive imaging techniques are frequently
      inconclusive. In this setting, percutaneous transcatheter biopsy might represent 
      a valid alternative to surgical biopsy. Intracardiac echocardiography
      (ICE)-guided biopsy offers high-quality imaging, is a relatively quick and easy
      interventional procedure to perform and does not require patient intubation or
      the assistance of an echocardiographer. We describe the case of a 47-year-old
      woman undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, who presented with a right
      atrial mass. Non-invasive imaging was inconclusive. Since no changes in the
      aspect or size of the mass were noticed after 2-week treatment with heparin,
      ICE-guided biopsy was performed, which confirmed the thrombotic nature of the
      mass. The patient underwent surgical resection of the thrombus and curative
      treatment of her breast cancer was pursued.

AB  - Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a relatively rare and aggressive subtype,
      accounting for nearly 2.5% of all diagnosed breast cancers worldwide. It is
      usually characterised by an acute onset, rapid clinical progression, poor
      prognosis and micrometastasis at the time of presentation. Prompt recognition of 
      clinical symptoms and identification of warning signs are vital in diagnosing and

TI  - Mammography Use Among Medicare Beneficiaries After Elimination of Cost Sharing.
PG  - 394-9
AB  - Background: We examined mammography use before and after Medicare eliminated cost
      sharing for screening mammography in January 2011. Methods: Using National Health
      Interview Survey data, we examined changes in mammography use between 2010 and
      2013 among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–74 years. Logistic regression and
      predictive margins were used to examine changes in use after adjusting for
      covariates. Results: In 2013, 74.7% of women reported a mammogram within 2 years,
      a 3.5 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, −0.3, 7.2) compared
      with 2010. Increases occurred among women aged 65–69 years, unmarried women, and 
      women with usual sources of care and 2–5 physician visits in the prior year.
      After adjustment, mammography use increased in 2013 versus 2010 (74.8% vs. 71.3%,
      P = 0.039). Interactions between year and income, insurance, race, or ethnicity
      were not significant. Conclusions: There was a modest increase in mammography use
      from 2010 to 2013 among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–74 years, possibly
      consistent with an effect of eliminating Medicare cost sharing during this time. 
      Findings suggest that eliminating cost sharing might increase use of recommended 
      screening services.

AB  - A 68-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presented with skin lesions
      and sternal pain. Clinical examination revealed ulcerative lesions on mastectomy 
      scar and CT scan showed contiguous sternal osteolysis. The main hypothesis was a 
      breast cancer recurrence; however, cutaneous and bone biopsies did not reveal any
      cancer cells. Skin tissue culture detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting
      ecthyma gangrenosum despite the absence of bacteraemia in our patient and despite
      her immunocompetence. Surgical treatment was performed, followed by a long course
      of antibiotherapy.

TI  - A novel method for radiotherapy patient identification using surface imaging.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - Performing a procedure on the wrong patient or site is one of the greatest errors
      that can occur in medicine. The addition of automation has been shown to reduce
      errors in many processes. In this work we explore the use of an automated patient
      identification process using optical surface imaging for radiotherapy treatments.
      Surface imaging uses visible light to align the patient to a reference surface in
      the treatment room. It is possible to evaluate the similarity between a daily
      set‐up surface image and the reference image using distance to agreement between 
      the points on the two surfaces. The higher the percentage overlapping points
      within a defined distance, the more similar the surfaces. This similarity metric 
      was used to intercompare 16 left‐sided breast patients. The reference surface for
      each patient was compared to 10 daily treatment surfaces for the same patient,
      and 10 surfaces from each of the other 15 patients (for a total of 160
      comparisons per patient), looking at the percent of points overlapping. For each 
      patient, the minimum same‐patient similarity score was higher than the maximum
      different‐patient score. For the group as a whole a threshold was able to
      classify correct and incorrect patients with high levels of accuracy. A 10‐fold
      cross‐validation using linear discriminant analysis gave cross‐validation loss of
      0.0074. An automated process using surface imaging is a feasible option to
      provide nonharmful daily patient identification verification using currently
      available technology.PACS number(s): 87.53.Jw, 87.55.N‐, 87.55.Qr, 87.57.N‐,

TI  - Prognostic Value of Circulating Tumor Cells Identified prior to Surgical
      Resection in Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be identified in approximately 25%
      of non-metastatic breast cancer patients (BC), and data are emerging regarding
      their prognostic significance. We hypothesized that CTCs identified prior to
      resection of the primary tumor would predict worse outcome in non-metastatic BC
      patients. Study Design: We performed CTC enumerations on 509 patients with
      non-metastatic BC as part of an IRB approved study. CTCs (per 7.5 ml blood) were 
      identified using the Cell Search® System (Janssen). The presence of ≥ 1 CTC
      meeting morphological criteria for malignancy was considered a positive result.
      Log-rank test and Cox regression analysis were applied to establish the
      association of CTCs with relapse-free and overall survival. Results: Median
      follow-up was 48 months and mean age was 53 years. Fifty-nine percent of patients
      (299/509) had tumors >2cm, and 46% (234/509) had positive lymph nodes. One
      hundred sixty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to CTC 
      assessment, and 343 patients were chemonaïve. One or more CTC was identified in
      43/166 (26%) of NACT treated patients, and in 81/343 (24%) of chemonaïve
      patients. CTCs were not associated with tumor size, grade, or lymph node status
      (P= NS). Detection of one or more CTCs predicted decreased relapse-free (log-rank
      P<0.001, HR = 2.72, 95% CI, 1.57 to 4.72; P<0.001) and overall survival (log-rank
      P=0.02, HR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.67; P = 0.03) at 48 months of follow-up.
      Conclusions: One or more CTCs identified prior to resection of the primary breast
      tumor predicted worse relapse-free and overall survival, irrespective of primary 
      tumor size, grade, or lymph node positivity.

      failure in a case of breast cancer.
LID - bcr2015214120
AB  - The liver is one of the commonest sites of metastatic involvement in breast
      cancer, usually evident as focal lesions on imaging tests. Rarely, the pattern of
      metastatic spread is so diffuse that it remains radiologically occult. Such
      patients usually present with signs of hepatic insufficiency without any focal
      lesions on liver imaging. In such cases, liver biopsy is required to make a
      definitive diagnosis. We report a case of a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman with
      metastatic breast cancer who presented with subacute progressive liver failure.
      Repeated imaging of the liver was normal or non-descript. Liver biopsy finally
      established the diagnosis of intrasinusoidal metastases from breast cancer.

TI  - Associations of Sex-steroid Hormones with Mortality in Women with Breast Cancer.
PG  - 559-67
AB  - PURPOSE: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between
      circulating levels of sex steroid hormones and risk of breast cancer in
      postmenopausal women. However, data on associations with breast cancer survival
      are limited. METHODS: We measured levels of estradiol, estrone, testosterone and 
      sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), in serum collected on average 30-months
      after diagnosis from 358 postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I–IIIA breast 
      cancer between 1995–1998 who participated in a multiethnic, prospective cohort
      study.. Women were followed through December, 2012. We evaluated associations
      between log-transformed analytes and breast cancer-specific and all-cause
      mortality fitting multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Over a 
      median of 14.5 years of follow-up, 102 deaths occurred; 43 of these were due to
      breast cancer. In models adjusted for ethnicity/study-site, age, body mass index,
      and tumor stage, increased levels of log-transformed SHBG were associated with
      reduced risk of both breast-cancer specific mortality (hazard ratio, HR=0.48; 95%
      confidence interval, CI=0.26–0.89) and all-cause mortality (HR=0.64, 95%
      CI=0.43–0.97). There were no associations between levels of estradiol, estrone or
      testosterone for either endpoint. In subgroup analyses, after correction for
      multiple testing, increased estrone was significantly associated with reduced
      risk for breast-cancer specific mortality among participants with ER-negative
      tumors (HR=0.16, 95% CI=0.05–0.63) but not among participants with ER-positive
      tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum levels of SHBG were associated with
      decreased risk of breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in women with
      breast cancer. These results should be confirmed in larger breast cancer survivor
      cohorts.

TI  - Comparison of Mammographic Changes Across Three Different Fractionation Schedules
      for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - Purpose: As the use of hypofractionated breast radiation therapy (RT) increases, 
      so will the need for long-term data on post-RT mammographic changes. The purpose 
      of the present study was to longitudinally compare the incidence of common
      mammographic sequelae seen after breast conserving surgery and RT in patients
      treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), hypofractionated
      whole breast irradiation (HWBI), and conventionally fractionated whole breast
      irradiation (WBI). Methods and Materials: Patients treated with either APBI or
      HWBI after breast conserving therapy and with ≥3 mammograms of the treated breast
      were identified. They were matched 1:1 by age ±5 years to patients treated with
      WBI. The mammograms were evaluated for common post-RT breast findings by a
      mammographer who was unaware of the treatment. The outcomes were analyzed using a
      cumulative logistic regression model; P<.05 indicated statistically significance.
      Results: Of 89 patients treated with RT from 2006 to 2011, 29 had received APBI, 
      30 had received HWBI, and 30 had received WBI. Their median age was 60 years
      (range 33–83). A total of 605 mammograms were evaluated, with a median follow-up 
      of 48 months. The treatment technique did not affect the severity of
      architectural distortion when the groups were evaluated longitudinally. The
      likelihood of finding skin thickening decreased with increasing follow-up
      duration (odds ratio 0.6; P<.001) adjusted for fractionation schemes. No
      differences were seen with respect to changes in skin thickening, fluid
      collections, or calcifications among the treatment groups, after adjustment for
      the follow-up time. The clinical characteristics, including age, race, T stage,
      and chemotherapy use, were not linked to the likelihood of finding several
      mammographic phenomena over time. Conclusions: Although specific post-treatment
      imaging findings evolved over time, RT fractionation did not alter the relative
      incidence or severity of architectural distortion, skin thickening, fluid
      collections, or calcifications. These findings will be useful to both
      radiologists and radiation oncologists when counseling patients regarding
      follow-up studies after RT.

TI  - Comparison of volumetric‐modulated arc therapy and dynamic conformal arc
      treatment planning for cranial stereotactic radiosurgery.
PG  - 92-101
AB  - The aim was to analyze arc therapy techniques according to the number and
      position of the brain lesions reported by comparing dynamic noncoplanar conformal
      arcs (DCA), two coplanar full arcs (RAC) with volumetric‐modulated arc therapy
      (VMAT), multiple noncoplanar partial arcs with VMAT (RANC), and two full arcs
      with VMAT and 10° table rotation (RAT). Patients with a single lesion (n = 10),
      multiple lesions (n = 10) or a single lesion close to organs at risk (n = 5) and 
      previously treated with DCA were selected. For each patient, the DCA treatment
      was replanned with all VMAT techniques. All DCA plans were compared with VMAT
      plans and evaluated in regard to the different quality indices and dosimetric
      parameters. For single lesion, homogeneity index (HI) better results were found
      for the RANC technique (0.17±0.05) compared with DCA procedure (0.27±0.05).
      Concerning conformity index (CI), the RAT technique gave higher and better values
      (0.85±0.04) compared with those obtained with the DCA technique (0.77±0.05). DCA 
      improved healthy brain protection (8.35±5.61 cc vs. 10.52±6.40 cc for RANC) and
      reduced monitor unit numbers (3046±374 MU vs. 4651±736 for RANC), even if global 
      room occupation was higher. For multiple lesions, VMAT techniques provided better
      HI (0.16) than DCA (0.24±0.07). The CI was improved with RAT (0.8±0.08 for RAT
      vs. 0.71±0.08 for DCA). The V10Gy healthy brain was better protected with DCA
      (9.27±4.57 cc). Regarding the MU numbers: RANC<RAT<RAC<DCA. For a single lesion
      close to OAR, RAT achieved high degrees of homogeneity (0.27±0.03 vs. 0.53±0.2
      for DCA) and conformity (0.72±0.06 vs. 0.56±0.13 for DCA) while sparing organs at
      risk (Dmax=12.36±1.05 Gy vs. 14.12±0.59 Gy for DCA, and Dmean=3.96±3.57 Gy vs.
      14.72±3.28 Gy for DCA). On the other hand, MU numbers were lower with DCA
      (2254±190 MU vs. 3438±457 MU for RANC) even if overall time was inferior with
      RAC. For a single lesion, DCA provide better plan considering low doses to
      healthy brain even if quality indexes are better for the others techniques. For
      multiple lesions, RANC seems to be the best compromise, due to the ability to
      deliver a good conformity and homogeneity plan while sparing healthy brain
      tissue. For a single lesion close to organs at risk, RAT is the most appropriate 
      technique.PACS numbers: 87.55. dk, 87.56.bd

TI  - Assessment of Background Parenchymal Enhancement and Lesion Kinetics in Breast
      MRI of BRCA 1/2 Mutation Carriers Compared to Matched Controls Using Quantitative
      Kinetic Analysis.
PG  - 358-67
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To investigate whether quantitative kinetic analysis of
      lesions and background parenchyma (BP) in breast MRI can elucidate differences
      between BRCA carriers and sporadic controls with high risk for breast cancer.
      Materials and Methods: 59 BRCA and 59 control cases (49 benign, 10 malignant)
      were examined in this study. Principal component analysis was applied for
      quantitative analysis of dynamic signal in background parenchyma (B) and lesion
      (L) in terms of initial enhancement ratio (IER) and delayed enhancement ratio
      (DER). Results: Control B-IER, B-DER, L-IER, and L-DER were higher than BRCA
      cases in all women and women with benign lesions; statistically significant
      differences in B-IER and B-DER (all women: p = 0.02 and p = 0.02, respectively;
      benign only: p = 0.005 and p = 0.005, respectively). In the control cohort, B-IER
      and B-DER were higher in the premenopausal women than in the postmenopausal women
      (p = 0.013 and 0.003, respectively), but not in the BRCA cohort; this led to
      significant differences in B-IER and B-DER between control and BRCA groups in the
      premenopausal women (p = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively), but not in the
      postmenopausal women. Conclusion: Results suggest possible differences in the
      vascular properties of BP between BRCA carriers and non-carriers and its
      association with menopausal status.

TI  - Sociocultural Factors and Breast Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for
      Diagnosis and Management.
PG  - 147-56
AB  - The incidence of breast cancer is on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and
      efforts at early diagnosis have not been very successful because the public has
      scant knowledge about the disease, a large percentage of breast cancer cases are 
      diagnosed late and mainly rural SSA women's practice of breast self-examination
      is poor. In this paper, we argue that an examination of the social and cultural
      contexts of SSA that influence breast cancer diagnosis and management in the
      region is needed. We discuss the implications of sociocultural factors, such as
      gender roles and spirituality, on breast cancer diagnosis and management in SSA.

TI  - Breast Cancer Subtypes: Morphologic and Biologic Characterization.
PG  - 103-19
AB  - Advances in basic science, technology and translational research have created a
      revolution in breast cancer diagnosis and therapy. Researchers' discoveries of
      genes defining variability in response to therapy and heterogeneity in clinical
      presentations and tumor biology are the foundation of the path to personalized
      medicine. The success of personalized breast cancer care depends on access to
      pertinent clinical information and risk factors, optimal imaging findings,
      well-established morphologic features, and traditional and contemporary
      prognostic/predictive testing. The integration of these entities provides an
      opportunity to identify patients who can benefit from specific therapies, and
      demonstrates the link between breast cancer subtypes and their association with
      different tumor biology. It is critical to recognize specific types of breast
      cancer in individual patients and design optimal personalized therapy. This
      article will highlight the roles of morphologic features and established tumor
      biomarkers on patient outcome.

TI  - p53 as an Effector or Inhibitor of Therapy Response.
LID - a026260
AB  - Although integrity of the p53 signaling pathway in a given tumor was expected to 
      be a critical determinant of response to therapies, most clinical studies failed 
      to link p53 status and treatment outcome. Here, we present two opposite
      situations: one in which p53 is an essential effector of cure by targeted
      leukemia therapies and another one in advanced breast cancers in which p53
      inactivation is required for the clinical efficacy of dose-dense chemotherapy. If
      p53 promotes or blocks therapy response, therapies must be tailored on its status
      in individual tumors.

TI  - Jaw position uncertainty and adjacent fields in breast cancer radiotherapy.
PG  - 240-51
AB  - Locoregional treatment of breast cancer involves adjacent, half blocked fields
      matched at isocenter. The objective of this work is to study the dosimetric
      effects of the uncertainties in jaw positioning for such a case, and how a
      treatment planning protocol including adjacent field overlap of 1 mm affects the 
      dose distribution. A representative treatment plan, involving 6 and 15 photon
      beams, for a patient treated at our hospital is chosen. Monte Carlo method
      (EGSnrc/BEAMnrc) is used to simulate the treatment. Uncertainties in jaw
      positioning of ±1 mm are addressed, which implies extremes in reality of 2 mm
      field gap/overlap when planning adjacent fields without overlap and 1 mm gap or 3
      mm overlap for a planning protocol with 1 mm overlap. Dosimetric parameters for
      PTV, lung and body are analyzed. Treatment planning protocol with 1 mm overlap of
      the adjacent fields does not considerably counteract possible underdosage of the 
      target in the case studied. PTV‐V95% is for example reduced from 95% for
      perfectly aligned fields to 90% and 91% for 2 mm and 1 mm gap, respectively.
      However, the risk of overdosage in PTV and in healthy soft tissue is increased
      when following the protocol with 1 mm overlap. A 3 mm overlap compared to 2 mm
      overlap results in an increase in maximum dose to PTV, PTV‐D2%, from 113% to
      121%. V120% for ‘Body‐PTV’ is also increased from 5 cm3 to 14 cm3. A treatment
      planning protocol with 1 mm overlap does not considerably improve the coverage of
      PTV in the case of erroneous jaw positions causing gap between fields, but
      increases the overdosage in PTV and doses to healthy tissue, in the case of
      overlapping fields, for the case investigated.PACS numbers: 87.55.D‐, 87.55.dk,

TI  - Contralateral breast dose from partial breast brachytherapy.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the dose to the contralateral breast
      during accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and to compare it to
      external beam‐published values. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) packets were
      used to measure the dose to the most medial aspect of the contralateral breast
      during APBI simulation, daily quality assurance (QA), and treatment. All patients
      in this study were treated with a single‐entry, multicatheter device for 10
      fractions to a total dose of 34 Gy. A mark was placed on the patient's skin on
      the medial aspect of the opposite breast. Three TLD packets were taped to this
      mark during the pretreatment simulation. Simulations consisted of an AP and
      Lateral scout and a limited axial scan encompassing the lumpectomy cavity
      (miniscan), if rotation was a concern. After the simulation the TLD packets were 
      removed and the patients were moved to the high‐dose‐rate (HDR) vault where three
      new TLD packets were taped onto the patients at the skin mark. Treatment was
      administered with a Nucletron HDR afterloader using Iridium‐192 as the treatment 
      source. Post‐treatment, TLDs were read (along with the simulation and QA TLD and 
      a set of standards exposed to a known dose of 6 MV photons). Measurements
      indicate an average total dose to the contralateral breast of 70 cGy for outer
      quadrant implants and 181 cGy for inner quadrant implants. Compared to external
      beam breast tangents, these results point to less dose being delivered to the
      contralateral breast when using APBI.PACS number: 87.55.D‐

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of cognitive-behavioral stress management in breast
      cancer: survival and recurrence at 11-year follow-up.
PG  - 319-28
AB  - Non-metastatic breast cancer patients often experience psychological distress
      which may influence disease progression and survival. Cognitive-behavioral stress
      management (CBSM) improves psychological adaptation and lowers distress during
      breast cancer treatment and long-term follow-ups. We examined whether breast
      cancer patients randomized to CBSM had improved survival and recurrence 8–15
      years post-enrollment. From 1998 to 2005, women (N = 240) 2–10 weeks post-surgery
      for non-metastatic Stage 0–IIIb breast cancer were randomized to a 10-week,
      group-based CBSM intervention (n = 120) or a 1-day psychoeducational seminar
      control (n = 120). In 2013, 8–15 years post-study enrollment (11-year median),
      recurrence and survival data were collected. Cox Proportional Hazards Models and 
      Weibull Accelerated Failure Time tests were used to assess group differences in
      all-cause mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and disease-free interval,
      controlling for biomedical confounders. Relative to the control, the CBSM group
      was found to have a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.21; 95 % CI
      [0.05, 0.93]; p = .040). Restricting analyses to women with invasive disease
      revealed significant effects of CBSM on breast cancer-related mortality (p =
      .006) and disease-free interval (p = .011). CBSM intervention delivered
      post-surgery may provide long-term clinical benefit for non-metastatic breast
      cancer patients in addition to previously established psychological benefits.
      Results should be interpreted with caution; however, the findings contribute to
      the limited evidence regarding physical benefits of psychosocial intervention
      post-surgery for non-metastatic breast cancer. Additional research is necessary
      to confirm these results and investigate potential explanatory mechanisms,
      including physiological pathways, health behaviors, and treatment adherence
      changes.

PG  - 567-80
AB  - Introduction: The adoption of precision medicine (PM) has been limited in
      practice to date, and yet its promise has attracted research investments.
      Developing foundational economic approaches for directing proper use of PM and
      stimulating growth in this area from multiple perspectives is thus quite timely. 
      Methods: Building on our previously developed Expected Value of Individualized
      Care (EVIC) framework, we conceptualize new decision-relevant metrics to better
      understand and forecast the expected value of PM. Several aspects of behavior at 
      the patient, physician and the payer level are considered that can inform the
      rate and manner in which PM innovations diffuse throughout the relevant
      population. We illustrate this framework and the methods using a retrospective
      evaluation of the use of OncotypeDx genomic test among breast cancer patients.
      Results: The enriched metrics can help inform many facets of PM decision making, 
      such as evaluating alternative reimbursement levels for PM tests, implementation 
      and education programs for physicians and patients, and decisions around research
      investments by manufacturers and public entities. We replicated prior published
      results on evaluation of OncotypeDx among breast cancer patients, but also
      illustrated that those results are based on assumptions that are often not met in
      practice. Instead, we show how incorporating more practical aspects of behavior
      around PM could lead to drastically different estimates of value. Conclusion: We 
      believe that the framework and the methods presented can provide decision makers 
      with more decision-relevant tool to explore the value of PM. There is a growing
      recognition that data on adoption is important to decision makers. More research 
      is needed to develop prediction models for potential diffusion of PM
      technologies.

TI  - Links between inflammation, amygdala reactivity, and social support in breast
      cancer survivors.
PG  - 34-8
AB  - Psychosocial stress can affect inflammatory processes that have important
      consequences for cancer outcomes and the behavioral side effects of cancer
      treatment. To date, however, little is known about the upstream neural processes 
      that may link psychosocial stressors and inflammation in cancer patients and
      survivors. To address this issue, 15 women who had been diagnosed with
      early-stage breast cancer and completed cancer treatment and 15 age- and
      ethnicity-matched women with no cancer history were recruited for a neuroimaging 
      study. Participants provided a blood sample for levels of circulating
      inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6), underwent an fMRI scan in which they
      completed a threat reactivity task designed to elicit activity in the amygdala,
      and reported their levels of perceived social attachment/ support. There were no 
      significant differences between cancer survivors and controls in levels of CRP or
      IL-6, in amygdala reactivity to the socially threatening images, or in levels of 
      perceived social support. However, results showed a strong, positive correlation 
      between CRP concentration and left amygdala reactivity in the survivor group that
      was not apparent in controls. Higher levels of social support in the survivor
      group were also associated with reduced amygdala reactivity and CRP. These data
      suggest the possibility of a stronger “neural-immune pipeline” among breast
      cancer survivors, such that peripheral inflammation is more strongly associated
      with neural activity in threat-related brain regions.

TI  - Using lesion washout volume fraction as a biomarker to improve suspicious breast 
      lesion characterization.
PG  - 389-95
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate using lesion washout (WO) volume
      fraction as a biomarker to improve the characterization of suspicious breast
      lesions. Study lesions consisted of a total of 60 malignant tumors (BI‐RADS 6)
      and 62 suspicious lesions (BI‐RADS 4 or 5). The biopsies of these suspicious
      lesions resulted in a total of 30 malignant tumors and 32 benign lesions,
      respectively, yielding a 48.4% positive predictive value (PPV) of the biopsies.
      The mean and standard deviation of the lesion WO volume fraction of these 60
      BI‐RADS 6 malignant tumors were first computed to establish a 99% sensitivity
      threshold value for malignant tumors, and then the biomarker was used to
      characterize the suspicious lesions. Using the biomarker would characterize all
      the malignant tumors as malignant, 12 out of the 32 benign lesions as benign,
      potentially resulting in a 24% improvement rate in the PPV of the biopsies (from 
      48.4% to 60%) and consequently a 22.5% reduction rate in the false‐positive rate 
      of benign biopsies (from 51.6% to 40%). The lesion WO volume fraction biomarker
      could improve the computer‐based assessment of breast MRI by increasing the PPV
      of breast biopsies and reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies without
      compromising sensitivity.PACS number: 87.61.Tg, 87.19.Xj

TI  - Development and clinical evaluation of a simple optical method to detect and
      measure patient external motion.
PG  - 306-21
AB  - A simple and independent system to detect and measure the position of a number of
      points in space was devised and implemented. Its application aimed to detect
      patient motion during radiotherapy treatments, alert of out‐of‐tolerances motion,
      and record the trajectories for subsequent studies. The system obtains the 3D
      position of points in space, through its projections in 2D images recorded by two
      cameras. It tracks black dots on a white sticker placed on the surface of the
      moving object. The system was tested with linear displacements of a phantom,
      circular trajectories of a rotating disk, oscillations of an in‐house phantom,
      and oscillations of a 4D phantom. It was also used to track 461 trajectories of
      points on the surface of patients during their radiotherapy treatments.
      Trajectories of several points were reproduced with accuracy better than 0.3 mm
      in the three spatial directions. The system was able to follow periodic motion
      with amplitudes lower than 0.5 mm, to follow trajectories of rotating points at
      speeds up to 11.5 cm/s, and to track accurately the motion of a respiratory
      phantom. The technique has been used to track the motion of patients during
      radiotherapy and to analyze that motion. The method is flexible. Its installation
      and calibration are simple and quick. It is easy to use and can be implemented at
      a very affordable price. Data collection does not involve any discomfort to the
      patient and does not delay the treatment, so the system can be used routinely in 
      all treatments. It has an accuracy similar to that of other, more sophisticated, 
      commercially available systems. It is suitable to implement a gating system or
      any other application requiring motion detection, such as 4D CT, MRI or PET.PACS

TI  - Combining large number of weak biomarkers based on AUC.
PG  - 3811-30
AB  - Combining multiple biomarkers to improve diagnosis and/or prognosis accuracy is a
      common practice in clinical medicine. Both parametric and non-parametric methods 
      have been developed for finding the optimal linear combination of biomarkers to
      maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),
      primarily focusing on the setting with a small number of well-defined biomarkers.
      This problem becomes more challenging when the number of observations is not
      order of magnitude greater than the number of variables, especially when the
      involved biomarkers are relatively weak. Such settings are not uncommon in
      certain applied fields. The first aim of this paper is to empirically evaluate
      the performance of existing linear combination methods under such settings. The
      second aim is to propose a new combination method, namely, the pairwise approach,
      to maximize AUC. Our simulation studies demonstrated that the performance of
      several existing methods can become unsatisfactory as the number of markers
      becomes large, while the newly proposed pairwise method performs reasonably well.
      Furthermore, we apply all the combination methods to real datasets used for the
      development and validation of MammaPrint. The implication of our study for the
      design of optimal linear combination methods is discussed.

TI  - Dosimetric effect due to the motion during deep inspiration breath hold for
      left‐sided breast cancer radiotherapy.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - Deep inspiration breath‐hold (DIBH) radiotherapy for left‐sided breast cancer can
      reduce cardiac exposure and internal motion. We modified our in‐house treatment
      planning system (TPS) to retrospectively analyze breath‐hold motion log files to 
      calculate the dosimetric effect of the motion during breath hold. Thirty
      left‐sided supine DIBH breast patients treated using AlignRT were studied.
      Breath‐hold motion was recorded — three translational and three rotational
      displacements of the treatment surface — the Real Time Deltas (RTD). The
      corresponding delivered dose was estimated using the beam‐on portions of the
      RTDs. Each motion was used to calculate dose, and the final estimated dose was
      the equally weighted average of the multiple resultant doses. Ten of thirty
      patients had internal mammary nodes (IMN) purposefully included in the tangential
      fields, and we evaluated the percentage of IMN covered by 40 Gy. The planned and 
      delivered heart mean dose, lungs V20 (volume of the lungs receiving >20 Gy),
      percentage of IMN covered by 40 Gy, and IMN mean dose were compared. The averaged
      mean and standard deviation of the beam‐on portions of the absolute RTDs were
      0.81±1.29 mm, 0.68±0.85 mm, 0.76±0.85 mm, 0.96°±0.49°,0.93°±0.43°, and
      1.03°±0.50°, for vertical, longitudinal, lateral, yaw, roll, and pitch,
      respectively. The averaged planned and delivered mean heart dose were 99 and 101 
      cGy. Lungs V20 were 6.59% and 6.74%. IMN 40 Gy coverage was 83% and 77%, and mean
      IMN dose was 4642 and 4518 cGy. The averaged mean motion during DIBH was smaller 
      than 1 mm and 1°, which reflects the relative reproducibility of the patient
      breath hold. On average, the mean heart dose and lungs V20 were reasonably close 
      to what have been planned. IMN 40 Gy coverage might be modestly reduced for
      certain cases.PACS number: 87.55.km, 87.55.N

TI  - Integration of a Radiosensitivity Molecular Signature into the Assessment of
      Local Recurrence Risk in Breast Cancer.
PG  - 631-8
AB  - Purpose/Objective: Recently, we developed RSI, a clinically-validated molecular
      signature that estimates tumor radiosensitivity. Here, we test whether
      integrating RSI with molecular subtype refines the classification of local
      recurrence risk in breast cancer Methods and Materials: RSI and molecular subtype
      were evaluated in 343 patients treated with breast-conserving therapy including
      whole-breast RT plus/minus tumor bed boost (dose range, 45 – 72 Gy). The follow
      up for patients without recurrence was 10 years. Clinical endpoint was local
      recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Results: While RSI did not uniformly predict for
      local recurrence across the entire cohort, combining RSI and molecular subtype
      identifies a subpopulation with an increased risk of local recurrence: triple
      negative (TN) and radioresistant (TN-R) (Ref –TN-R, HR=0.37 (0.15, 0.92) p=0.02).
      TN patients that were RSI-Sensitive/Intermediate (RSI-S/Int) had similar LR rates
      as LUM patients (HR=0.86 (0.47, 1.57) p=0.63). On multivariate analysis (MVA)
      combined RSI-Molecular Subtype (p=0.004), along with age (p=0.001) were the most 
      significant predictors of LR. In contrast, integrating RSI into the LUM subtype
      did not identify additional risk groups. We hypothesized that RT dose escalation 
      was impacting radioresistance in the LUM subtype and serving as a confounder.
      Indeed, increased RT dose decreased LR only in the LUM-R subset (HR = 0.23 (0.05,
      0.98), p=0.03). On MVA, RT dose was an independent variable only in the LUMA/B-RR
      subset (HR=0.025 (0.001, 0.946), p=0.046), along with age (p=0.008), T stage
      (p=0.004) and chemotherapy (p=0.008). Conclusions: Combined molecular subtype-RSI
      identifies a novel molecular sub-population (Triple Negative and Radioresistant) 
      with an increased risk of local recurrence after BCT. We propose RSI-molecular
      subtype may be useful in guiding RT-based decisions in breast cancer.

TI  - IMP3 Promotes Stem-like Properties in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer by Regulating
      SLUG.
PG  - 1111-21
AB  - IMP3 (insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA binding protein 3) is an oncofetal
      protein whose expression is prognostic for poor outcome in several cancers.
      Although IMP3 is expressed preferentially in triple- negative breast cancer
      (TNBC), its function is poorly understood. We observed that IMP3 expression is
      significantly higher in tumor initiating than non-tumor initiating breast cancer 
      cells and we demonstrate that IMP3 contributes to self-renewal and tumor
      initiation, properties associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). The mechanism by
      which IMP3 contributes to this phenotype involves its ability to induce the stem 
      cell factor SOX2. IMP3 does not interact with SOX2 mRNA significantly or regulate
      SOX2 expression directly. We discovered that IMP3 binds avidly to SNAI2 (SLUG)
      mRNA and regulates its expression by binding to the 5′ UTR. This finding is
      significant because SLUG has been implicated in breast CSCs and TNBC. Moreover,
      we show that SOX2 is a transcriptional target of SLUG. These data establish a
      novel mechanism of breast tumor initiation involving IMP3 and they provide a
      rationale for its association with aggressive disease and poor outcome.

PG  - S566-72
AB  - Background: Although locoregional recurrence is known to affect overall survival 
      for operable breast cancer, the impact of receptor status on locoregional control
      is debated. Currently, hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor
      receptor-2 (HER2) status are generally not considered relevant to surgical
      choice. This study examines recent population-level surgical trends with regard
      to receptor status. Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
      Results (SEER) data to identify stage I–III female breast cancers diagnosed from 
      2010 to 2011. Patients were categorized by HR and HER2 receptor status.
      Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess factors
      associated with undergoing mastectomy and the choice of contralateral
      prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). Results: The overall mastectomy rate for the
      87,504 women diagnosed in 2010–2011 was 43.4 %. On multivariate analysis, the
      odds of receiving mastectomy was greater for HER2-positive disease with either
      HR-negative or HR-positive status, than for women with HER2-negative/HR-positive 
      disease (odds ratio 1.73 and 1. 31, respectively; all p values <0.001). Age,
      stage, marital status, race, and year of diagnosis also correlated with
      mastectomy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was associated with CPM, while
      HER2 status was not. The mastectomy rate, which increased overall from 2006 to
      2010, has continued to increase for stage III disease but has decreased for stage
      I disease. Mastectomy rates overall were lower in 2011 than 2010 (p = 0.012).
      Conclusions: HER2-positive disease and TNBC were independent predictors of more
      extensive surgery in this large, recent, population-based cohort. Although
      mastectomy rates have continued to increase for stage III disease, mastectomy
      rates overall were lower in 2011 than in previous years.

TI  - Is there a preferred IMRT technique for left‐breast irradiation?
PG  - 197-205
AB  - Not all clinics have breath‐hold radiotherapy available for left‐breast
      irradiation. However intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has also been
      advocated as a means of lowering heart doses. There is currently no large‐scale, 
      long‐term follow‐up data after breast IMRT and, since dose distributions may
      differ from classic tangent‐based radiotherapy, caution is needed to avoid
      unexpected worsening of the late toxicity profile. We compared four IMRT
      techniques for free‐breathing left‐breast irradiation. Consistent with the
      aforementioned concerns, our goal in planning was to prioritize organ at risk
      (OAR) sparing in a way that mimicked tangent‐based radiotherapy. Ten simultaneous
      integrated boost treatment plans (PTVelective=15×2.67 Gy;PTVboost=15×3.35 Gy)
      were created using 1) hybrid‐IMRT (H‐IMRT), 2) full IMRT (F‐IMRT), and 3)
      volumetric‐modulated arc therapy with two partial arcs (2ARC) and 4) six partial 
      arcs (6ARC). Reduction in OAR mean and low dose was prioritized. End‐points
      included OAR sparing (e.g., heart, left anterior descending artery [LAD+3 mm],
      lungs, and contralateral breast) and PTV coverage/dose homogeneity. Under these
      conditions we found the following: 1) H‐IMRT provided the best mean and low dose 
      OAR sparing, PTVelective coverage (mean V95%=98%),PTVboost coverage (V95%=98%),
      and PTV homogeneity. However, it delivered most intermediate–high dose to the
      heart, LAD+3 mm and ipsilateral lung; 2) 6ARC had the best intermediate–high dose
      sparing, followed by F‐IMRT, but this was at the expense of more dose in the
      contralateral lung and breast and worse PTV coverage
      (PTVelective mean V95%=96%/97% and PTVboost mean V95%=91%/96% for 6ARC/F‐IMRT).
      When trying to spare mean and low dose to OARs, the preferred IMRT technique for 
      left‐breast irradiation without breath‐hold was H‐IMRT. This is currently the
      standard solution in our institution for left‐breast radiotherapy under
      free‐breathing and breath‐hold conditions.PACS numbers: 87.53kn, 87.53Jw,

TI  - Tangent field technique of TomoDirect improves dose distribution for whole‐breast
      irradiation.
PG  - 225-32
AB  - TomoDirect (TD) is an intensity‐modulated radiotherapy system that uses a fixed
      gantry angle instead of rotational beam delivery. Here, we investigated the
      effect of the multiple beam technique of TomoDirect on dose distribution compared
      with commonly‐used tangential beams. We included 45 consecutive patients with
      right breast cancer who underwent postoperative radiotherapy in our institute in 
      the present study. Clinical target volume (CTV) was the whole right breast. The
      planning target volume (PTV) was created by expanding the CTV by a 0.5 cm margin.
      Paired TD plans were generated for each patient; a two‐beam plan using paired
      tangential beams and a six‐beam plan with four additional beams with modified
      gantry angles of ± 5° from the original tangential beam set. A prescribed dose of
      50 Gy was defined for 50% isodoses of the PTV. The six‐beam plan delivered
      significantly more homogeneous doses to the PTV than the two‐beam plan; and the
      mean dose to the PTV in the six‐beam plan more closely reflected the prescribed
      dose. V20Gy and mean dose to the right lung and mean dose to the whole body were 
      also significantly decreased in the six‐beam plan. However, duration of radiation
      exposure was 1 min longer in the six‐beam plan than in the two‐beam plan. The
      dose distribution to the target and organs at risk were improved with the
      six‐beam plan relative to the two‐beam plan without increasing the whole‐body
      radiation dose. The six‐beam plan using TD is a simple technique that can be
      routinely applied to whole‐breast irradiation in clinical practice.PACS number:

TI  - Helical 4D CT pitch management for the Brilliance CT Big Bore in clinical
      practice.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - In external beam radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with thoracic
      malignancies, respiratory‐correlated CT (4D CT) is used to obtain high quality
      studies in the presence of respiratory motion. When helical 4D CT scans are
      acquired with a Brilliance CT Big Bore, the pitch must meet two conditions. It
      must be low enough to avoid motion artifacts, and high enough to cover the entire
      scan length within 120 s to prevent overheating of the X‐ray tube. We developed a
      nomogram that can be used to obtain a suitable pitch satisfying both
      requirements. We also assessed the effects on the image quality of a pitch that
      exceeds the maximum pitch, and of a field of view (FOV) reduction. It was shown
      that, for AV G and MIP reconstructions, the manufacturer's maximum pitch equation
      yields an underestimation due to its FOV term.PACS number: 87.57.Q‐, 87.57.cp

TI  - Equivalent survival with mastectomy or breast conserving surgery plus radiation
      in young women under the age of 40 with early-stage breast cancer: a national
      registry based stage-by-stage comparison.
PG  - 390-7
AB  - Introduction/Background: Studies have shown that young patients with early-stage 
      breast cancer (BC) are increasingly getting mastectomy instead of breast
      conserving therapy (BCT) consisting of lumpectomy and radiation. We examined the 
      difference between outcomes in young women (age<40) treated with BCT versus
      mastectomy. Materials and Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
      Results database was queried for women <40 years of age with stage I–II invasive 
      BC treated with surgery from 1998–2003. Breast cancer specific survival (BCSS)
      and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
      the log–rank test between treatment types. Results: Of the 7665 women, 3249
      patients received BCT, while 2627 patients had mastectomy and no radiation. When 
      separated by stage (I, IIA, and IIB), with median follow-up of 111 months, the
      BCT and mastectomy only groups showed no statistically significant differences in
      the BCSS and OS. Overall, age group 35–39 (66% of total) was associated with
      better 10-year BCSS (88%) and OS (86.1%) compared to younger patients aged 20–34 
      (34% of total), who had 10-year BCSS and OS of 84.1% and 82.3%, respectively
      (P<0.001 for both BCSS and OS). However, when patients of each age group were
      further subdivided by stages, the BCT group continued to show non-inferior BCSS
      and OS compared to the mastectomy group in all of the subgroups. Conclusion: Our 
      study suggests that while young age may be a poor prognostic factor for BC, there
      is no evidence that these patients have better outcome with mastectomy over BCT.

TI  - Dietary soy isoflavones increase metastasis to lungs in an experimental model of 
      breast cancer with bone micro-tumors.
PG  - 323-33
AB  - Bone is one of the most common sites for metastasis in breast cancer (BC).
      Micro-metastasis in bone marrow was detected in 30% of patients with stage I, II,
      or III BC at primary surgery and is a strong indicator of poor prognosis. The
      role dietary soy isoflavones play in BC with bone micro-metastasis is unclear. In
      this study, we examined the effects of genistein, daidzein, (−)-equol or a
      mixture of soy isoflavones on BC with bone micro-metastasis using an experimental
      model of murine mammary cancer 4T1 cells engineered with luciferase. A small
      number (1,000) of 4T1 cells were injected into the tibia of female Balb/c mice to
      establish micro-tumors in bone. Soy isoflavones were supplemented in the AIN-93G 
      diet at 750 mg/kg and were provided to mice from 3 weeks before to 3 weeks after 
      cell injection. Bioluminescent imaging was conducted on day 2 (D2), D6, D8, D16
      and D20 post cell injection and the results indicated dietary soy isoflavones
      enhanced the growth of bone micro-tumors on D8. Furthermore, dietary soy
      isoflavones stimulated metastatic tumor formation in lungs and increased Ki-67
      protein expression in these metastasized tumors. In vitro, soy isoflavones (< 10 
      µM) had limited effects on the growth, motility or invasion of 4T1 cells. Thus,
      the in vivo stimulatory effect could be likely due to systemic effects between
      the host, 4T1 tumors and soy isoflavones. In conclusion, soy isoflavones
      stimulate BC with bone micro-metastasis in mice and further investigations are
      needed regarding their consumption by BC survivors.

TI  - Commissioning and quality assurance for the treatment delivery components of the 
      AccuBoost system.
PG  - 129-43
AB  - The objective for this work was to develop a commissioning methodology for the
      treatment delivery components of the AccuBoost system, as well as to establish a 
      routine quality assurance program and appropriate guidance for clinical use based
      on the commissioning results. Various tests were developed: 1) assessment of the 
      accuracy of the displayed separation value; 2) validation of the dwell positions 
      within each applicator; 3) assessment of the accuracy and precision of the
      applicator localization system; 4) assessment of the combined dose profile of two
      opposed applicators to confirm that they are coaxial; 5) measurement of the
      absolute dose delivered with each applicator to confirm acceptable agreement with
      dose based on Monte Carlo modeling; 6) measurements of the skin‐to‐center dose
      ratio using optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters; and 7) assessment of
      the mammopad cushion's effect on the center dose. We found that the difference
      between the measured and the actual paddle separation is <0.1 cm for the
      separation range of 3 cm to 7.5 cm. Radiochromic film measurements demonstrated
      that the number of dwell positions inside the applicators agree with the values
      from the vendor, for each applicator type and size. The shift needed for a good
      applicator‐grid alignment was within 0.2 cm. The dry‐run test using film
      demonstrated that the shift of the dosimetric center is within 0.15 cm. Dose
      measurements in water converted to polystyrene agreed within 5.0% with the Monte 
      Carlo data in polystyrene for the same applicator type, size, and depth. A solid 
      water‐to‐water (phantom) factor was obtained for each applicator, and all future 
      annual quality assurance tests will be performed in solid water using an average 
      value of 1.07 for the solid water‐to‐water factor. The skin‐to‐center dose ratio 
      measurements support the Monte Carlo‐based values within 5.0% agreement. For the 
      treatment separation range of 4 cm to 8 cm, the change in center dose would be
      <1.0% for all applicators when using a compressed pad of 0.2 cm to 0.3 cm. The
      tests performed ensured that all treatment components of the AccuBoost system are
      functional and that a treatment plan can be delivered with acceptable accuracy.
      Based on the commissioning results, a quality assurance manual and guidance
      documents for clinical use were developed.PACS numbers: 87.55.Qr, 87.56.Da,

TI  - Clinical experience using a video‐guided spirometry system for deep inhalation
      breath‐hold radiotherapy of left‐sided breast cancer.
PG  - 251-60
AB  - The purpose was to report clinical experience of a video‐guided spirometry system
      in applying deep inhalation breath‐hold (DIBH) radiotherapy for left‐sided breast
      cancer, and to study the systematic and random uncertainties, intra‐ and
      interfraction motion and impact on cardiac dose associated with DIBH. The data
      from 28 left‐sided breast cancer patients treated with spirometer‐guided DIBH
      radiation were studied. Dosimetric comparisons between free‐breathing (FB) and
      DIBH plans were performed. The distance between the heart and chest wall measured
      on the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) and MV portal images, dDRR(DIBH)
      and dport(DIBH), respectively, was compared as a measure of DIBH setup
      uncertainty. The difference (Δd) between dDRR(DIBH) and dport(DIBH) was defined
      as the systematic uncertainty. The standard deviation of Δd for each patient was 
      defined as the random uncertainty. MV cine images during radiation were acquired.
      Affine registrations of the cine images acquired during one fraction and multiple
      fractions were performed to study the intra‐ and interfraction motion of the
      chest wall. The median chest wall motion was used as the metric for intra‐ and
      interfraction analysis. Breast motions in superior–inferior (SI) direction and
      “AP” (defined on the DRR or MV portal image as the direction perpendicular to the
      SI direction) are reported. Systematic and random uncertainties of 3.8 mm and 2
      mm, respectively, were found for this spirometer‐guided DIBH treatment. MV cine
      analysis showed that intrafraction chest wall motions during DIBH were 0.3 mm in 
      “AP” and 0.6 mm in SI. The interfraction chest wall motions were 3.6 mm in “AP”
      and 3.4 mm in SI. Utilization of DIBH with this spirometry system led to a
      statistically significant reduction of cardiac dose relative to FB treatment. The
      DIBH using video‐guided spirometry provided reproducible cardiac sparing with
      minimal intra‐ and interfraction chest wall motion, and thus is a valuable
      adjunct to modern breast treatment techniques.PACS number: 87.55.kh, 87.55.ne,

TI  - Accuracy of a new paired imaging technique for position correction in whole
      breast radiotherapy.
PG  - 22-31
AB  - Image‐guided position verification in breast radiotherapy is accurately performed
      with kilovoltage cone beam CT (kV‐CBCT). The technique is, however,
      time‐consuming and there is a risk for patient collision. Online position
      verification performed with orthogonal‐angled mixed modality paired imaging is
      less time‐consuming at the expense of inferior accuracy compared to kV‐CBCT. We
      therefore investigated whether a new tangential‐angled single modality paired
      imaging technique can reduce the residual error (RE) of orthogonal‐angled mixed
      modality paired imaging. The latter was applied to 20 breast cancer patients.
      Tangential‐angled single modality paired imaging was investigated in 20 breast
      and 20 breast cancer patients with locoregional lymph node irradiation. The
      central lung distance (CLD) residual error and the longitudinal residual error
      were determined during the first 5 treatment fractions. Off‐line matching of the 
      tangential breast field images, acquired after online position correction, was
      used. The mean, systematic, and random REs of each patient group were calculated.
      The systematic REs were checked for significant differences using the F‐test.
      Tangential‐angled single modality paired imaging significantly reduced the
      systematic CLD residual error of orthogonal‐angled mixed modality paired imaging 
      for the breast cancer patients, from 2.3 mm to 1.0 mm, and also significantly
      decreased the systematic longitudinal RE from 2.4 mm to 1.3 mm. PTV margins,
      which account for the residual error (PTVRE), were also calculated. The PTVRE
      margin needed to account for the RE of orthogonal‐angled mixed modality paired
      imaging (i.e., 8 mm) was halved by tangential‐angled single modality paired
      imaging. The differences between the systematic REs of tangential‐angled single
      modality paired imaging of the breast cancer patients and the breast cancer
      patients with locoregional lymph node irradiation were not significant, yielding 
      comparable PTVRE margins. In this study, we showed that tangential‐angled single 
      modality paired imaging is superior to orthogonal‐angled mixed modality paired
      imaging to correct the position errors in whole breast radiotherapy.PACS numbers:

TI  - Is self‐management feasible and acceptable for addressing nutrition and physical 
      activity needs of cancer survivors?
PG  - 3358-73
AB  - Background: Self‐management is recommended for patients with chronic conditions, 
      but its use with cancer survivors is underexplored. Optimal strategies for
      achieving lifestyle changes in cancer survivors are not known. Objective: We
      aimed to determine feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of
      self‐management‐based nutrition and physical activity interventions for cancer
      survivors. Design, setting and participants: Adult survivors (n = 25) during
      (Group 1 , n = 11) or post (Group 2, n = 14)‐curative chemotherapy for solid
      tumours, most (n = 20, 80%) with breast cancer, were recruited prospectively from
      a single clinical centre. Intervention: The Flinders Living Well Self‐Management 
      Program, a generic self‐management care planning programme, was utilized to
      establish patient‐led nutrition and exercise goals within a tailored 12‐week
      intervention. Fortnightly progress reviews occurred with assessments at baseline,
      6 and 12 weeks. Results: Most participants (84%) found the intervention
      acceptable/very acceptable. Both groups showed a trend towards significant
      improvement in the self‐management capability ‘knowledge about changing risk
      factors’ (P = 0.047); Group 2 showed a trend towards significantly improved
      ‘psychological impacts’ (P = 0.007). Goal ratings improved for both groups
      (P = 0.001). Quality of life improved for both groups for emotional functioning
      (P = 0.03). Physical functioning improved for Group 2 (P = 0.05); however, most
      symptom domains worsened for Group 1, as expected given their treatment stage.
      Discussion and conclusions: Self‐management interventions are feasible for this
      population. In particular, building self‐management capacity during the active
      phase of patients' cancer treatment provides health and psychosocial benefits.
      Larger randomized controlled trials are required to further determine efficacy.
      Further translational research is also needed to determine
      acceptability,feasibility, enablers and barriers for clinicians embedding this
      approach into routine cancer survivorship care.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes and practice of breast cancer screening among female
      personnel of Walailak University.
PG  - 3069-78
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide.
      Methods: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, awareness and practice of
      breast cancer screening for early detection of breast cancer among female
      personnel at a university. A cross‐sectional descriptive study was administered
      to female personnel of Walailak University in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. Data
      were analysed by SPSS version 16. Results: Among total of 217 female personnel,
      the lecturers and laboratory scientists and general officers had a significantly 
      higher mean knowledge score about the practice of breast cancer screening than
      temporary employees (P < 0.0001). The level of education and income of
      respondents may be involved with this difference in knowledge (P < 0.05).
      Conclusion: This study concludes that knowledge about the practice of breast
      cancer screening could be attributed to different career groups, level of
      education and income of respondents. There is a very urgent need for regular
      learning courses for personnel concerning knowledge about the practice of breast 
      cancer screening especially for those personnel with less formal education and
      low income.

TI  - A dosimetry study precisely outlining the heart substructure of left breast
      cancer patients using intensity‐modulated radiation therapy.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of delineating the
      substructure of the heart by using 64‐slice spiral CT coronary angiography (CTA) 
      in breast cancer patients who underwent left breast‐conserving surgery, and to
      compare the dosimetric differences between the targets and organs at risk in the 
      prone and supine positions in intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      planning. From January to December 2011, ten patients who underwent left
      breast‐conserving surgery were enrolled in this study. CTA was performed in both 
      the supine and prone positions during the simulation, and conventional scanning
      without CTA was performed at the same time. Image registration was performed for 
      paired image series using a commercially available planning system. In a
      conventional image series, the clinical target volume (CTV) of the whole breast, 
      planning target volume (PTV), bilateral lungs (L‐Lung, R‐Lung), spinal cord,
      contralateral breast (R‐Breast), and heart were delineated. In the CTA image
      series, the left ventricular (LV) and left anterior descending coronary arteries 
      (LAD) and the planning risk volume (LAD‐PRV) of the LAD (LAD with a 1 cm margin) 
      were outlined. For each patient, two separate IMRT plans were developed for the
      supine and prone positions. A total of 20 plans were generated. The following
      indicators were compared: Dmean and D95 for the PTV; Dmean, V5, and V20 for the
      left lung; Dmean, V10, V20, V25, V30, and V40 for the heart and its substructures
      (LAD‐PRV, LV); Dmean and V5 for the right lung; and Dmax and Dmean for the right 
      breast. Using CTA to delineate the substructures of the heart is simple and
      straightforward. Plans for both the prone and supine positions reached the
      prescribed dose for the PTV without significant differences. Dose distributions
      were acceptable for both the prone and supine positions. However, the LAD‐PRV,
      LV, heart, and L‐Lung received smaller doses in the prone position plans than in 
      the supine position plans. The Dmean values reduced by
      445.83cGy(p=0.043),575.00cGy(p=0.003),402.00cGy(p=0.039), and 553.33cGy(p=0.004) 
      in the LAD‐PRV, LV, heart, and L‐Lung. In addition, the V25 lessened
      12.54%(p=0.042) and 8.70%(p=0.019) in the LV and heart, while the V20 was
      decreased 8.57%(p=0.042),15.21%(p=0.026),12.59%(p=0.011), and 10.62%(p=0.006) in 
      the LAD‐PRV, LV, heart, and L‐Lung, respectively. Similarly, the V10 and V30 were
      reduced by 28.31% (p=0.029) and 5.54%(p=0.034) in the heart, while the V5 was cut
      back 27.86%(p=0.031) in the L‐Lung. For most Asian women with average‐sized
      breasts after breast conserving treatment (BCT), prone positioning during IMRT
      radiation will reduce the dose to the ipsilateral lung, heart, and substructures 
      of the heart, which may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events after
      radiotherapy more than radiation therapy performed in a supine position. Using
      CTA to delineate the substructures of the heart is easy and intuitive. It is
      cost‐effective and highly recommended for breast cancer IMRT. However, the
      dose‐volume limits of the heart substructures remain to be determined.PACS

TI  - Cost of Services Provided by the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early
      Detection Program.
PG  - 2604-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program
      (NBCCEDP) is the largest cancer screening program for low-income women in the
      United States. This study updates previous estimates of the costs of delivering
      preventive cancer screening services in the NBCCEDP. METHODS: We developed a
      standardized web-based cost-assessment tool to collect annual activity-based cost
      data on screening for breast and cervical cancer in the NBCCEDP. Data were
      collected from 63 of the 66 programs that received funding from the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention during the 2006/2007 fiscal year. We used these
      data to calculate costs of delivering preventive public health services in the
      program. RESULTS: We estimated the total cost of all NBCCEDP services to be $296 
      (standard deviation [SD], $123) per woman served (including the estimated value
      of in-kind donations, which constituted approximately 15% of this total estimated
      cost). The estimated cost of screening and diagnostic services was $145 (SD, $38)
      per women served, which represented 57.7% of the total cost excluding the value
      of in-kind donations. Including the value of in-kind donations, the weighted mean
      cost of screening a woman for breast cancer was $110 with an office visit and $88
      without, the weighted mean cost of a diagnostic procedure was $401, and the
      weighted mean cost per breast cancer detected was $35,480. For cervical cancer,
      the corresponding cost estimates were $61, $21, $415, and $18,995, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These NBCCEDP cost estimates may help policy makers in planning and 
      implementing future costs for various potential changes to the program.

TI  - Novel Carbazole Inhibits Phospho-STAT3 through Induction of Protein–Tyrosine
      Phosphatase PTPN6.
PG  - 6342-53
AB  - The aberrant activation of STAT3 occurs in many human cancers and promotes tumor 
      progression. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine at amino acid Y705 is essential for
      the function of STAT3. Synthesized carbazole derived with fluorophore compound 12
      was discovered to target STAT3 phosphorylation. Compound 12 was found to inhibit 
      STAT3-mediated transcription as well as to reduce IL-6 induced STAT3
      phosphorylation in cancer cell lines expressing both elevated and low levels of
      phospho-STAT3 (Y705). Compound 12 potently induced apoptosis in a broad number of
      TNBC cancer cell lines in vitro and was effective at inhibiting the in vivo
      growth of human TNBC xenograft tumors (SUM149) without any observed toxicity.
      Compound 12 also effectively inhibited the growth of human lung tumor xenografts 
      (A549) harboring aberrantly active STAT3. In vitro and in vivo studies showed
      that the inhibitory effects of 12 on phospho-STAT3 were through up-regulation of 
      the protein–tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6. Our present studies strongly support the 
      continued preclinical evaluation of compound 12 as a potential chemotherapeutic
      agent for TNBC and cancers with constitutive STAT3 signaling.

TI  - Racial Disparities in Adoption of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and
      Lymphedema Risk in Women With Breast Cancer.
PG  - 788-96
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Racial disparities exist in many aspects of breast cancer care.
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was developed to replace axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND) for staging early breast cancer to minimize complications.
      Racial disparities in the use of SLNB remain incompletely characterized, and
      their effect on lymphedema risk is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine racial
      differences in SLNB use among patients with pathologically node-negative breast
      cancer during the period when SLNB became the preferred method for axillary
      staging as well as whether such differences affect lymphedema risk. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective study was conducted using the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare–linked database from 2002
      through 2007 to identify cases of incident, nonmetastatic, pathologically
      node-negative breast cancer in women aged 66 years or older. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURES: Sentinel lymph node biopsy use and 5-year cumulative incidence of
      lymphedema by race. RESULTS: Of 31 274 women identified, 1767 (5.6%) were black, 
      27 856 (89.1%) were white, and 1651 (5.3%) were of other or unknown race.
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 73.7% of white patients and 62.4% of 
      black patients (P < .001). The use of SLNB increased by year for both black and
      white patients (P < .001); however, a fixed disparity of approximately 12
      percentage points in SLNB use persisted through 2007. In adjusted analysis, black
      patients were significantly less likely than white patients to undergo SLNB (odds
      ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75; P < .001). Overall, the 5-year cumulative
      lymphedema risk was 8.2% in whites and 12.3% in blacks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 
      95% CI, 1.23–1.67; P < .001). When stratified by type of axillary surgery, 5-year
      lymphedema risk was 6.8% in whites undergoing SLNB (HR, 1 [reference]), 8.8% in
      blacks undergoing SLNB (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02–1.60; P = .03), 12.2% in whites
      undergoing ALND (1.79; 1.63–1.96; P < .001), and 18.0% in blacks undergoing ALND 
      (2.76; 2.25–3.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although SLNB use
      increased in both black and white patients with pathologically node-negative
      breast cancer from 2002 through 2007, the rates of SLNB remained lower in black
      than white patients during this entire period by approximately 12 percentage
      points. This racial disparity in SLNB use contributed to racial disparities in
      lymphedema risk. Improvements in the dissemination of new techniques are needed
      to avoid disparities in breast cancer care and patient outcomes, particularly in 
      disadvantaged groups.

TI  - The influence of diabetes severity on receipt of guideline-concordant treatment
      for breast cancer.
PG  - 199-209
AB  - Diabetes severity may influence breast cancer treatment choices. We examined
      whether receipt of guideline-concordant breast cancer treatment varied with
      diabetes severity. Cancer registry data from seven states regarding 6,912 stage
      I–III breast cancers were supplemented by medical record abstraction and
      physician verification. We used logistic regression models to examine
      associations of diabetes severity with guideline-concordant locoregional
      treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy adjusted for
      sociodemographics, comorbidity, and tumor characteristics. We defined guideline
      concordance using National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, and diabetes 
      and comorbidities using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 index. After
      adjustment, there was significant interaction of diabetes severity with age for
      locoregional treatment (p = 0.001), with many diabetic women under age 70 less
      frequently receiving guideline-concordant treatment than non-diabetic women.
      Among similarly aged women, guideline concordance was lower for women with mild
      diabetes in their late fifties through mid-sixties, and with moderate/severe
      diabetes in their late forties to early sixties. Among women in their
      mid-seventies to early eighties, moderate/severe diabetes was associated with
      increased guideline concordance. For adjuvant chemotherapy, moderate/severe
      diabetes was less frequently associated with guideline concordance than no
      diabetes [OR 0.58 (95 % CI 0.36–0.94)]. Diabetes was not associated with
      guideline-concordant hormonal treatment (p = 0.929). Some diabetic women were
      less likely to receive guideline-concordant treatment for stage I–III breast
      cancer than non-diabetic women. Diabetes severity was associated with lower
      guideline concordance for locoregional treatment among middle-aged women, and
      lower guideline concordance for adjuvant chemotherapy. Differences were not
      explained by comorbidity and may contribute to potentially worse breast cancer
      outcomes.

TI  - “Maybe they have found something new” participants’ views on returning cohort
      psychosocial survey results.
PG  - 2425-36
AB  - Background: Although greater attention is currently being paid to participants in
      research, no studies have dealt so far with the issue of returning aggregate
      psychosocial results to cohort participants. Objective: (i) To explore
      participants’ views about disclosure of the aggregate results of a French
      national psychosocial cohort survey on the epidemiology of preventive behaviour
      in women from families with a hereditary breast cancer risk. (ii) To assess
      whether it is worth consulting participants before designing the disclosure
      process. Design: A qualitative study using semi‐structured face‐to‐face
      interviews and a thematic analysis based on Grounded Theory methods.
      Participants: Nineteen interviews were conducted with cancer‐free female BRCA
      mutation carriers/non‐carriers aged 31–79 who had participated in a cohort survey
      by answering self‐administered questionnaires. Results: Participants showed
      considerable interest in the issue of result disclosure. The preferences
      expressed about disclosure were rarely relevant to the topic investigated,
      however, as they often focused on medical knowledge about BRCA and not on the
      psychosocial findings obtained. This confusion may have been due to the
      participants’ experience of the survey procedures, including its longitudinal
      nature, the occurrence of very few interactions with the investigators and the
      wide range of topics addressed in the questionnaires. Conclusion: Investigators
      should ascertain participants’ expectations and preferences by consulting them
      before disclosing the results obtained. Although the disclosure process may not
      meet participants’ expectations completely, consultation is the key to preventing
      them from having irrealistic expectations about the information they are going to
      receive.

TI  - Increased copy number of the DLX4 homeobox gene in breast axillary lymph node
      metastasis.
PG  - 177-87
AB  - DLX4 is a homeobox gene strongly implicated in breast tumor progression and
      invasion. Our main objective was to determine the DLX4 copy number status in
      sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis to assess its involvement in the initial
      stages of the axillary metastatic process. A total of 37 paired samples of SLN
      metastasis and primary breast tumors (PBT) were evaluated by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and array comparative
      genomic hybridization assays. DLX4 increased copy number was observed in 21.6% of
      the PBT and 24.3% of the SLN metastasis; regression analysis demonstrated that
      the DLX4 alterations observed in the SLN metastasis were dependent on the ones in
      the PBT, indicating that they occur in the primary tumor cell populations and are
      maintained in the early axillary metastatic site. In addition, regression
      analysis demonstrated that DLX4 alterations (and other DLX and HOXB family
      members) occurred independently of the ones in the HER2/NEU gene, the main
      amplification driver on the 17q region. Additional studies evaluating DLX4 copy
      number in non-SLN axillary lymph nodes and/or distant breast cancer metastasis
      are necessary to determine if these alterations are carried on and maintained
      during more advanced stages of tumor progression and if could be used as a
      predictive marker for axillary involvement.

TI  - Comorbidity Burden and Guideline-Concordant Care for Breast Cancer.
PG  - 482-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between level and type of comorbidity and
      guideline-concordant care for early-stage breast cancer. DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
      SETTING: National Program of Cancer Registry (NPCR) Breast and Prostate Cancer
      Patterns of Care study, which re-abstracted medical records from 2004 in seven
      cancer registries. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with stage 0–III breast cancer.
      MEASUREMENTS: Multicomponent guideline-concordant management was modeled based on
      tumor size, node status, and hormone receptor status, according to consensus
      guidelines. Comorbid conditions and severity were measured using the Adult
      Comorbidity Evaluation Index (ACE-27). Multivariate logistic regression models
      determined factors associated with guideline-concordant care and included overall
      ACE-27 scores and 26 separate ACE comorbidity categories, age, race, stage, and
      source of payment. RESULTS: The study sample included 6,439 women (mean age 58.7,
      range 20–99; 76% white; 44% with no comorbidity; 70% estrogen- or
      progesterone-receptor positive, or both; 31% human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 positive). Care was guideline concordant in 60%. Guideline concordance
      varied according to overall comorbidity burden (70% for none; 61% for minor; 58% 
      for moderate, 43% for severe; P < .05). In multivariate analysis, the presence of
      hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01–1.30)
      predicted guideline concordance, whereas dementia (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24–0.82)
      predicted lack of guideline concordance. Older age (≥50) and black race were
      associated with less guideline concordance, regardless of comorbidity level.
      CONCLUSION: When reporting survival outcomes in individuals with breast cancer
      with comorbidity, adherence to care guidelines should be among the covariates.

TI  - Dosimetric evaluation of multilumen intracavitary balloon applicator rotation in 
      high‐dose‐rate brachytherapy for breast cancer.
PG  - 76-89
AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate dosimetric impact of multilumen balloon
      applicator rotation in high‐dose‐rate (HDR) brachytherapy for breast cancer.
      Highly asymmetrical dose distribution was generated for patients A and B,
      depending upon applicator proximity to skin and rib. Both skin and rib spacing
      was ≤0.7 cm for A; only rib spacing was ≤0.7 cm for B. Thirty‐five rotation
      scenarios were simulated for each patient by rotating outer lumens every 10° over
      ±180∘ range with respect to central lumen using mathematically calculated
      rotational matrix. Thirty‐five rotated plans were compared with three plans: 1)
      original multidwell multilumen (MDML) plan, 2) multidwell single‐lumen (MDSL)
      plan, and 3) singledwell single‐lumen (SDSL) plan. For plan comparison, planning 
      target volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL) coverage (dose to 95% and 90% volume of
      PTV_EVAL) (D95 and D90), skin and rib maximal dose (Dmax), and normal breast
      tissue volume receiving 150% (V150) and 200% (V200) of prescribed dose (PD) were 
      evaluated. Dose variation due to device rotation ranged from −5.6% to 0.8% (A)
      and −6.5% to 0.2% (B) for PTV_EVAL D95; −5.2% to 0.4% (A) and −4.1% to 0.7% (B)
      for PTV_EVAL D90; −2.0 to 18.4% (A) and −7.8 to 17.5% (B) for skin Dmax; −11.1 to
      22.8% (A) and −4.7 to 55.1% (B) of PD for rib Dmax, respectively. Normal breast
      tissue V150 and V200 variation was <1.0 cc, except for −0.1 to 2.5 cc (B) of
      V200. Furthermore, 30° device rotation increased rib Dmax over 145% of PD: 152.9%
      (A) by clockwise 30° rotation and 152.5% (B) by counterclockwise 30° rotation.
      For a highly asymmetric dose distribution, device rotation can outweigh the
      potential benefit of improved dose shaping capability afforded by multilumen and 
      make dosimetric data worse than single‐lumen plans unless it is properly
      corrected.PACS number: 87.53.Jw

TI  - Comparison of an anthropomorphic PRESAGE® dosimeter and radiochromic film with a 
      commercial radiation treatment planning system for breast IMRT: a feasibility
      study.
PG  - 363-74
AB  - This work presents a comparison of an anthropomorphic PRESAGE® dosimeter and
      radiochromic film measurements with a commercial treatment planning system to
      determine the feasibility of PRESAGE® for 3D dosimetry in breast IMRT. An
      anthropomorphic PRESAGE® phantom was created in the shape of a breast phantom. A 
      five‐field IMRT plan was generated with a commercially available treatment
      planning system and delivered to the PRESAGE® phantom. The anthropomorphic
      PRESAGE® was scanned with the Duke midsized optical CT scanner (DMOS‐RPC) and the
      OD distribution was converted to dose. Comparisons were performed between the
      dose distribution calculated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system,
      PRESAGE®, and EBT2 film measurements. DVHs, gamma maps, and line profiles were
      used to evaluate the agreement. Gamma map comparisons showed that Pinnacle3
      agreed with PRESAGE® as greater than 95% of comparison points for the PTV passed 
      a ±3%/±3mm criterion when the outer 8 mm of phantom data were discluded. Edge
      artifacts were observed in the optical CT reconstruction, from the surface to
      approximately 8 mm depth. These artifacts resulted in dose differences between
      Pinnacle3 and PRESAGE® of up to 5% between the surface and a depth of 8 mm and
      decreased with increasing depth in the phantom. Line profile comparisons between 
      all three independent measurements yielded a maximum difference of 2% within the 
      central 80% of the field width. For the breast IMRT plan studied, the Pinnacle3
      calculations agreed with PRESAGE® measurements to within the ±3%/±3mm gamma
      criterion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the PRESAGE® to be fashioned
      into anthropomorphic shape, and establishes the accuracy of Pinnacle3 for breast 
      IMRT. Furthermore, these data have established the groundwork for future
      investigations into 3D dosimetry with more complex anthropomorphic phantoms.PACS

TI  - A novel approach for superficial intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using a 50 kV
      X‐ray source: a technical and case report.
PG  - 167-76
AB  - The use of IORT as a treatment modality for patients with close or positive
      margins has increased over the past decade. For situations where a flat area (up 
      to 6 cm in diameter) has to be treated intraoperatively, new applicators for
      superficial treatment with a miniature X‐ray source (INTRABEAM system) were
      developed. Here we report our evaluation of the dosimetric characteristics of
      these new applicators and their first clinical use. Each of these flat and
      surface applicators consists of a radiation protective metal tube and a
      flattening filter, which converts the spherical dose distribution of the X‐ray
      source into a flat one. The homogeneity of each dose distribution and depth‐dose 
      measurements were evaluated using film dosimetry in a solid water phantom and a
      soft X‐ray ionization chamber in a water tank. The first patient was treated with
      5 Gy delivered in 5 mm using a 4 cm FLAT applicator over 21 minutes. The flat
      applicators show the maximum homogeneity, with a uniformity ratio of 1.02‐1.08 in
      certain depths. In 1 mm depth surface applicators show a uniformity ratio of
      1.15‐1.28. They also show a higher dose rate and a steeper dose gradient compared
      to the flat applicators. The results of this investigation demonstrated that the 
      flat and surface applicators have unique dosimetric characteristics that need to 
      be considered during the treatment planning stages. This work also showed that it
      is possible to perform a superficial localized IORT which provides new
      application possibilities for use of the INTRABEAM system.PACS number: 87.55.ne

TI  - Reproducibility of the external surface position in left‐breast DIBH radiotherapy
      with spirometer‐based monitoring.
PG  - 130-40
AB  - Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) in left‐sided breast cancer radiotherapy
      treatments allows for a reduction in cardiac and pulmonary doses without
      compromising target coverage. The selection of the most appropriate technology
      for DIBH monitoring is a crucial issue. We evaluated the stability and
      reproducibility of DIBHs controlled by a spirometric device, by assessing the
      variability of the external surface position within a single DIBH (intra‐DIBH)
      and between DIBHs performed in the same treatment session (intrafraction) or in
      different sessions (interfraction). The study included seven left‐breast cancer
      patients treated with spirometer‐based DIBH radiotherapy. Infrared optical
      tracking was used to record the 3D coordinates of seven to eleven passive markers
      placed on the patient's thoraco‐abdominal surface during 29‐43 DIBHs performed in
      six to eight treatment sessions. The obtained results showed displacements of the
      external surface between different sessions up to 6.3 mm along a single
      direction, even at constant inspired volumes. The median value of the
      interfraction variability in the position of breast passive markers was 2.9 mm
      (range 1.9‐4.8 mm) in the latero‐lateral direction, 3.6 mm (range 2.2‐4.6 mm) in 
      the antero‐posterior direction, and 4.3 mm (range 2.8‐6.2 mm) in the
      cranio‐caudal direction. There were no significant dose distribution variations
      for target and organs at risk with respect to the treatment plan, confirming the 
      adequacy of the applied clinical margins (15 mm) to compensate for the measured
      setup uncertainties. This study demonstrates that spirometer‐based control does
      not guarantee a stable and reproducible position of the external surface in
      left‐breast DIBH radiotherapy, suggesting the need for more robust DIBH
      monitoring techniques when reduced margins and setup uncertainties are required
      for improving normal tissue sparing and decreasing cardiac and pulmonary
      toxicity.PACS number: 87.55.Km

TI  - Economies of scale in federally-funded state-organized public health programs:
      results from the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Programs.
PG  - 321-30
AB  - This study investigates the existence of economies of scale in the provision of
      breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services by state National
      Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) grantees. A translog
      cost function is estimated as a system with input factor share equations. The
      estimated cost function is then used to determine output levels for which average
      costs are decreasing (i.e., economies of scale exist). Data were collected from
      all state NBCCEDP programs and District of Columbia for program years 2006–2007, 
      2008–2009 and 2009–2010 (N =147). Costs included all programmatic and in-kind
      contributions from federal and non-federal sources, allocated to breast and
      cervical cancer screening activities. Output was measured by women served, women 
      screened and cancers detected, separately by breast and cervical services for
      each measure. Inputs included labor, rent and utilities, clinical services, and
      quasi-fixed factors (e.g., percent of women eligible for screening by the
      NBCCEDP). 144 out of 147 program-years demonstrated significant economies of
      scale for women served and women screened; 136 out of 145 program-years displayed
      significant economies of scale for cancers detected. The cost data were
      self-reported by the NBCCEDP State programs. Quasi-fixed inputs were allowed to
      affect costs but not economies of scale or the share equations. The main analysis
      accounted for clustering of observations within State programs, but it did not
      make full use of the panel data. The average cost of providing breast and
      cervical cancer screening services decreases as the number of women screened and 
      served increases.

TI  - A two‐point scheme for optimal breast IMRT treatment planning.
PG  - 307-21
AB  - We propose an approach to determining optimal beam weights in breast/chest wall
      IMRT treatment plans. The goal is to decrease breathing effect and to maximize
      skin dose if the skin is included in the target or, otherwise, to minimize the
      skin dose. Two points in the target are utilized to calculate the optimal
      weights. The optimal plan (i.e., the plan with optimal beam weights) consists of 
      high energy unblocked beams, low energy unblocked beams, and IMRT beams. Six
      breast and five chest wall cases were retrospectively planned with this scheme in
      Eclipse, including one breast case where CTV was contoured by the physician.
      Compared with 3D CRT plans composed of unblocked and field‐in‐field beams, the
      optimal plans demonstrated comparable or better dose uniformity, homogeneity, and
      conformity to the target, especially at beam junction when supraclavicular nodes 
      are involved. Compared with nonoptimal plans (i.e., plans with nonoptimized
      weights), the optimal plans had better dose distributions at shallow depths close
      to the skin, especially in cases where breathing effect was taken into account.
      This was verified with experiments using a MapCHECK device attached to a motion
      simulation table (to mimic motion caused by breathing).PACS number: 87.55 de

TI  - Determining Efficacy of Breast Cancer Therapy by PET Imaging of HER2 mRNA.
PG  - 994-9
AB  - Introduction: Monitoring the effectiveness of therapy early and accurately
      continues to be challenging. We hypothesize that determination of Human Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) mRNA in malignant breast cancer (BC) cells by
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, before and after treatment, would
      reflect therapeutic efficacy. Method: WT4340, a (PNA) HER2 mRNA was synthesized
      together with -CSKC, a cyclic peptide, which facilitated internalization of the
      PNA via IGFR expressed on BC cells, and DOTA that chelated Cu-64. Mice (n=8) with
      BT474 ER+/HER2+ human BC received doxorubicin (DOX, 1.5 mg/kg) i.p. weekly (x3). 
      Mice (n=8) without DOX served as controls. All mice were PET imaged with F-18-FDG
      and 48 hrs later with Cu-64-WT4340. PET imaging were performed before and 72 hrs 
      after each treatment. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were determined and
      percent change calculated. Animal body weight (BW) and tumor volume (TV) were
      measured. Results: SUV for Cu-64-WT4340 after DOX treatment declined by 54±17%
      after the second dose, 41±15% after the fourth dose, and 29±7% after the sixth
      dose compared with 42±22%, 31±18%, and 13±9% (p<0.05) for F-18-FDG. In untreated 
      mice, the corresponding percent SUV for Cu-64-WT4340 were 145±82%, 165±39%, and
      212±105% of pretreatment SUV compared with 108±28%, 151±8%, and 152±355%,
      (p<0.08) for F-18-FDG. TV in mice after second dose were 114.15±61.83 compared
      with 144.7±64.4% for control mice. BW of DOX-treated mice were 103.4±7.6% of
      pretreatment, 100.1±4.3 for control mice. Conclusion: Therapeutic efficacy was
      apparent sooner by molecular PET imaging than by determination of reduction in
      TV.

      Radiation Therapy for Stage I and II Breast Carcinoma – Year-5 Toxicity and
      Cosmesis.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - Introduction: RTOG 95-17, a Phase II trial to evaluate multicatheter
      brachytherapy (mCathBrachy) as the sole method of radiation therapy (RT) for
      Stage I-II breast cancer (BrCa), was the first cooperative group trial in North
      America to evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and include
      patient reported outcomes (PROs). This report presents year-5 toxicity and
      cosmesis data. Methods: Following lumpectomy and axillary dissection for invasive
      BrCa (tumor size <3 cm with 0-3 positive lymph nodes), 100 patients (pts), 98
      evaluable, were treated (txed) with mCathBrachy from 1997-2000 with 34 Gy in 10
      BID high dose-rate fractions or 45 Gy in 3.5-6 days as a low dose-rate implant to
      1-2 cm beyond the lumpectomy bed. PROs and physician reported outcomes of
      toxicity, cosmesis and tx satisfaction at year-5 are reported here, defined as
      data submitted 54-78 months after tx. Results: Grade (G) 1-2 skin toxicity
      developed in 78% of pts and G3 in 13% (no G4). Tx effects included skin
      dimpling/indentation (37%), fibrosis (45%), telangiectasias (45%), skin catheter 
      marks (54%), and symptomatic fat necrosis (15%). Breast asymmetry was reported in
      73%. Rates of excellent-good cosmesis were similar between PROs (66%) and
      radiation oncologists (68%). PROs of tx satisfaction at year-5 was 75%.
      Conclusion: RTOG 95-17 documents year-5 skin toxicity and tx effects of
      mCathBrachy APBI which are associated with PROs of good-excellent cosmesis and
      high tx satisfaction. This emphasizes the importance of PROs when assessing BrCa 
      tx. NSABP B39/RTOG 0413 will allow for definitive comparisons between APBI and
      whole breast RT.

TI  - The effect of intermittent energy and carbohydrate restriction v. daily energy
      restriction on weight loss and metabolic disease risk markers in overweight
      women.
PG  - 1534-47
AB  - Intermittent energy restriction may result in greater improvements in insulin
      sensitivity and weight control than daily energy restriction (DER). We tested two
      intermittent energy and carbohydrate restriction (IECR) regimens, including one
      which allowed ad libitum protein and fat (IECR + PF). Overweight women (n 115)
      aged 20 and 69 years with a family history of breast cancer were randomised to an
      overall 25% energy restriction, either as an IECR (2500–2717 kJ/d, <40 g
      carbohydrate/d for 2 d/week) or a 25% DER (approximately 6000 kJ/d for 7 d/week) 
      or an IECR + PF for a 3-month weight-loss period and 1 month of weight
      maintenance (IECR or IECR + PF for 1 d/week). Insulin resistance reduced with the
      IECR diets (mean −0·34 (95% CI −0·66, −0·02) units) and the IECR + PF diet (mean 
      −0·38 (95% CI −0·75, −0·01) units). Reductions with the IECR diets were
      significantly greater compared with the DER diet (mean 0·2 (95% CI −0·19, 0·66)
      µU/unit, P=0·02). Both IECR groups had greater reductions in body fat compared
      with the DER group (IECR: mean −3·7 (95% CI −2·5, −4·9) kg, P=0·007; IECR + PF:
      mean −3·7 (95% CI −2·8, −4·7) kg, P=0·019; DER: mean −2·0 (95% CI −1·0, 3·0) kg).
      During the weight maintenance phase, 1 d of IECR or IECR + PF per week maintained
      the reductions in insulin resistance and weight. In the short term, IECR is
      superior to DER with respect to improved insulin sensitivity and body fat
      reduction. Longer-term studies into the safety and effectiveness of IECR diets
      are warranted.

TI  - Cone‐beam computed tomography image guided therapy to evaluate lumpectomy cavity 
      variation before and during breast radiotherapy.
PG  - 209-19
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rate of change (RoC) in the size of
      the lumpectomy cavity (LC) before and during breast radiotherapy (RT) using
      cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT), relative to the initial LC volume at CT
      simulation (CTVLC) and timing from surgery. A prospective institutional review
      board‐approved study included 26 patients undergoing breast RT: 20 whole breast
      irradiation (WBI) patients and six partial breast irradiation (PBI) patients,
      with surgical clips outlining the LC. The patients underwent CT simulation
      (CTsim) followed by five CBCTs during RT, once daily for PBI and once weekly for 
      WBI. The distance between surgical clips and their centroid (D) acted as a
      surrogate for LC size. The RoC of the LC size, defined as the percentage change
      of D between two scans divided by the time interval in days between the scans,
      was calculated before (CTsim to CBCT1) and during RT (CBCT1 to CBCT5). The mean
      RoC of D for all patients before starting RT was −0.25%/day (range, −1.3 to 1.4) 
      and for WBI patients during RT was −0.15%/day (range, −0.45 to 0.40). Stratified 
      by median CTVLC, the RoC before RT for large CTVLC group (≥25.7cc) was 15 times
      higher (−0.47%/day) than for small CTVLC group (<25.7 cc) (−0.03%/day), p=0.06.
      For patients undergoing CTsim< 42 days from surgery, the RoC before RT was
      −0.43%/day compared to −0.07%/day for patients undergoing CTsim≥42 days from
      surgery, p=0.12. For breast cancer RT, the rate of change of the LC is affected
      by the initial cavity size and the timing from surgery. Resimulation closer to
      the time of boost treatment should be considered in patients who are initially
      simulated within six weeks of surgery and/or with large CTVLC.PACS number:

TI  - Multi-Field-of-View Framework for Distinguishing Tumor Grade in ER+ Breast Cancer
      From Entire Histopathology Slides.
PG  - 2089-99
AB  - Modified Bloom–Richardson (mBR) grading is known to have prognostic value in
      breast cancer (BCa), yet its use in clinical practice has been limited by intra- 
      and interobserver variability. The development of a computerized system to
      distinguish mBR grade from entire estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BCa
      histopathology slides will help clinicians identify grading discrepancies and
      improve overall confidence in the diagnostic result. In this paper, we isolate
      salient image features characterizing tumor morphology and texture to
      differentiate entire hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained histopathology
      slides based on mBR grade. The features are used in conjunction with a novel
      multifield-of-view (multi-FOV) classifier—a whole-slide classifier that extracts 
      features from a multitude of FOVs of varying sizes—to identify important image
      features at different FOV sizes. Image features utilized include those related to
      the spatial arrangement of cancer nuclei (i.e., nuclear architecture) and the
      textural patterns within nuclei (i.e., nuclear texture). Using slides from 126
      ER+ patients (46 low, 60 intermediate, and 20 high mBR grade), our grading system
      was able to distinguish low versus high, low versus intermediate, and
      intermediate versus high grade patients with area under curve values of 0.93,
      0.72, and 0.74, respectively. Our results suggest that the multi-FOV classifier
      is able to 1) successfully discriminate low, medium, and high mBR grade and 2)
      identify specific image features at different FOV sizes that are important for
      distinguishing mBR grade in H and E stained ER+ BCa histology slides.

TI  - The Effect of Grapefruit Intake on Endogenous Serum Estrogen Levels in
      Postmenopausal Women.
PG  - 644-52
AB  - Although grapefruit intake leads to elevated serum estrogen levels when hormones 
      are taken orally, there are no published data on the effect on endogenous levels.
      We conducted a pilot dietary intervention study among healthy postmenopausal
      volunteers to test whole grapefruit, 2 juices, and 1 grapefruit soda. Fifty-nine 
      participants were recruited through the Love/Avon Army of Women. The study
      consisted of a 3-wk run-in, 2 wk of grapefruit intake, and a 1-wk wash-out. Eight
      fasting blood samples were collected. An additional 5 samples drawn at 1, 2, 4,
      8, and 10 hr after grapefruit intake were collected during an acute-phase study
      for 10 women. Serum assays for estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estrone-3-sulfate
      (E1S), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone-binding globulin were
      conducted. Whole grapefruit intake had significant effects on endogenous E1S.
      Peak effects were seen at 8 hr, increasing by 26% from baseline. No changes in
      mean E1 or E2 with whole fruit intake were observed. In contrast, fresh juice,
      bottled juice, and soda intake all had significant lowering effects on E2. The
      findings suggest an important interaction between grapefruit intake and
      endogenous estrogen levels. Because endogenous estrogen levels are associated
      with breast cancer risk, further research is warranted.

TI  - The Prolactin Receptor Transactivation Domain Is Associated with Steroid Hormone 
      Receptor Expression and Malignant Progression of Breast Cancer.
PG  - 217-33
AB  - The polypeptide hormone prolactin (PRL) stimulates breast epithelial cell growth,
      differentiation, and motility through its cognate receptor, PRLr. PRLr is
      expressed in most breast cancers; however, its exact role remains elusive. Our
      laboratory previously described a novel mode of PRLr signaling in which
      Stat5a-mediated transcription is regulated through ligand-induced phosphorylation
      of the PRLr transactivation domain (TAD). Herein, we used a PRLr
      transactivation-deficient mutant (PRLrYDmut) to identify novel TAD-specific
      target genes. Microarray analysis identified 120 PRL-induced genes up-regulated
      by wild type but not PRLrYDmut. Compared with control, PRLr expression
      significantly induced expression of approximately 4700 PRL-induced genes, whereas
      PRLrYDmut ablated induction of all but 19 of these genes. Ingenuity pathway
      analysis found that the PRLr TAD most profoundly affected networks involving
      cancer and proliferation. In support of this, PRLrYDmut expression reduced
      anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, pathway
      analysis identified a link between the PRLr TAD and the estrogen and progesterone
      receptors (ERα/PR). Although neither ERα nor PR was identified as a PRL target
      gene, a TAD mutation significantly impaired ERα/PR expression and estrogen
      responsiveness. TMA analysis revealed a marked increase in nuclear, but not
      cytoplasmic, PRLr TAD phosphorylation as a function of neoplastic progression. We
      propose that PRLr TAD phosphorylation contributes to breast cancer pathogenesis, 
      in part through regulation of ERα and PR, and has potential utility as a
      biomarker in this disease.

TI  - Characteristics of US Counties with No Mammography Capacity.
PG  - 1239-48
AB  - Access to screening mammography may be limited by the availability of facilities 
      and machines, and nationwide mammography capacity has been declining. We assessed
      nationwide capacity at state and county levels from 2003 to 2009, the most recent
      year for which complete data were available. Using mammography facility
      certification and inspection data from the Food and Drug Administration, we
      geocoded all mammography facilities in the United States and determined the total
      number of fully accredited mammography machines in each US County. We categorized
      mammography capacity as counties with zero capacity (i.e., 0 machines) or
      counties with capacity (i.e.,≥1 machines), and then compared those two categories
      by sociodemographic, health care, and geographic characteristics. We found that
      mammography capacity was not distributed equally across counties within states
      and that more than 27 % of counties had zero capacity. Although the number of
      mammography facilities and machines decreased slightly from 2003 to 2009, the
      percentage of counties with zero capacity changed little. In adjusted analyses,
      having zero mammography capacity was most strongly associated with low population
      density (OR = 11.0; 95 % CI 7.7–15.9), low primary care physician density (OR =
      8.9; 95 % CI 6.8–11.7), and a low percentage of insured residents (OR = 3.3; 95 %
      CI 2.5–4.3) when compared with counties having at least one mammography machine. 
      Mammography capacity has been and remains a concern for a portion of the US
      population—a population that is mostly but not entirely rural.

TI  - Comparing post‐operative human breast specimen radiograph and MRI in lesion
      margin and volume assessment.
PG  - 267-76
AB  - The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential for identifying
      malignant breast lesions and their margins on large specimen MRI, in comparison
      to specimen radiography and clinical dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE‐MRI).
      Breast specimens were imaged with an MR scanner immediately after surgery, with
      an IRB‐approved protocol and with the patients' informed consent. Specimen sizes 
      were at least 5 cm in diameter and approximately 1 to 4 cm thick. Coronal and
      axial gradient echo MR images without fat suppression were acquired over the
      whole specimens using a 9.4T animal scanner. Findings on specimen MRI were
      compared with findings on specimen radiograph, and their volumes were compared
      with measurements obtained from clinical DCE‐MRI. The results showed that
      invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) lesions were easily identified using MRI and the 
      margins were clearly distinguishable from nearby tissue. However, ductal
      carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions were not clearly discernible and were diffused
      with poorly defined margins on MRI. Calcifications associated with DCIS were
      visualized in all specimens on specimen radiograph. There is a strong correlation
      between the maximum diameter of lesions as measured by radiograph and MRI
      (r=0.93), as well as the maximum diameter measured by pathology and
      radiograph/MRI (r < 0.75). The volumes of IDC measured on specimen MRI were
      slightly smaller than those measured on DCE‐MRI. Imaging of excised human breast 
      lumpectomy specimens with high magnetic field MRI provides promising results for 
      improvements in lesion identification and margin localization for IDC. However,
      there are technical challenges in visualization of DCIS lesions. Improvements in 
      specimen imaging are important, as they will provide additional information to
      standard radiographic analysis.PACS numbers: 87.61.Tg; 87.59.B

TI  - Dose distribution changes with shielding disc misalignments and wrong
      orientations in breast IOERT: a Monte Carlo – GEANT4 and experimental study.
PG  - 74-92
AB  - One of the most relevant risks in breast intraoperative electron radiotherapy
      (IOERT) is the incorrect positioning of the shielding disc. If such a setup error
      occurs, the treatment zone could receive a nonuniform dose delivery, and a
      considerable part of the electron beam could hit — and irradiate — the patient's 
      healthy tissue. However misalignment and tilt angle of the shielding disc can be 
      evaluated, but it is not possible to measure the corresponding in vivo dose
      distribution. This led us to develop a simulation using the Geant4 Monte Carlo
      toolkit to study the effects of disc configuration on dose distribution. Some
      parameters were investigated: the shielding factor (SF), the radiation back
      scattering factor (BSF), the volume–dose histogram in the treatment zone, and the
      maximum leakage dose (MLD) in normal tissue. A lateral shift of the disc (in the 
      plane perpendicular to the beam axis) causes a decrease in SF (from 4% for a
      misalignment of 5 mm to 40% for a misalignment of 40 mm), but no relevant dose
      variations were found for a tilt angle until 10°. In the same uncorrected disc
      positions, the BSF shows no significant change. MLD rises to 3.45 Gy for a 14 mm 
      misalignment and 4.60 Gy for 30° tilt angle when the prescribed dose is 21 Gy.
      The simulation results are compared with the experimental ones, and allow an a
      posteriori estimation of the dose distribution in the breast target and
      underlying healthy tissue. This information could help the surgical team choose a
      more correct clinical setup, and assist in quantifying the degree of success or
      failure of an IOERT breast treatment.PACS number: 87.53.Jw, 87.55.dk, 87.55.Gh,

TI  - The feasibility study of using multiple partial volumetric‐modulated arcs therapy
      in early stage left‐sided breast cancer patients.
PG  - 62-73
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a multiple
      partial volumetric‐modulated arcs therapy (MP‐VMAT) technique on the left breast 
      irradiation and to evaluate the dosimetry and treatment efficiency. Ten patients 
      with left‐sided breast cancer who had been treated by whole breast irradiation
      were selected for the treatment plan evaluation by using six partial volumetric
      modulated arcs. Each arc consisted of a 50° gantry rotation. The planning target 
      volumes and the normal organs, including the right breast, the bilateral lungs,
      left ventricle, heart, and unspecified tissue, were contoured on the CT images.
      Dose‐volume histograms were generated and the delivery time for each arc was
      recorded. The PTV received greater than 95% of the V95 for all cases, and the
      maximum dose was within ±1% of 110% of the prescription dose. The mean
      homogeneity index (HI) was 10.61±0.99, and mean conformity index (CI) was
      1.21±0.03. The mean dose, V5, V10, V25, and V30 of the heart were 7.61±1.38 Gy,
      59.73% ±15.87%, 24.39% ±6.82%, 2.52% ±1.11%, and 1.57% ±0.71%, respectively. The 
      volume of the left ventricle receiving 25 Gy was 5.15% ±2.23%. The total lung
      mean dose was 5.57±0.36 Gy, with V5 of 25.39% ±3.88% and V20 of 5.66% ±0.89%. The
      right breast received a mean dose of 2.13±0.22 Gy, with V5 of 1.83% ±1.22% and
      V10 of 0.04% ±0.12%. The mean dose of unspecified tissue was 5.34±0.37 Gy and V5 
      was 22.23% ±1.57%. The volume of the unspecified tissue receiving 50 Gy was 0.50%
      ±0.14%. The mean delivery time for each arc was 13.9 seconds. The average MU
      among ten patients was 511 MU (range 443 to 594 MUs). The MP‐VMAT technique for
      the left‐sided breast cancer patients achieved adequate target dose coverage
      while maintaining low doses to organs‐at‐risk, and therefore reduced the
      potential for induction of second malignancy and side effects. The highly
      efficient treatment delivery would be beneficial for improving patient
      throughput, providing patient comfort, and achieving precise treatment with the
      breathing control system.PACS number: 87.55.‐x, 87.55.D‐, 87.55.dk

TI  - Evaluating Factors Associated with Unknown SEER Summary Stage 2000 Derived from
      Collaborative Stage.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Background: Information on cancer stage is critical for guiding treatment and
      assessing disease prognosis. The Percentage of unknown staged cancer cases varies
      considerably across state cancer registries; factors contributing to the
      variations in unknown stage have not been reported in the literature before. The 
      purpose of this study was to examine whether these variations are influenced by
      demographic and clinical factors as well as type of reporting facilities.
      Methods: Invasive colorectal, lung, female breast, and prostate cancers diagnosed
      in 2004–2007 and staged (derived Summary Stage 2000) according to Collaborative
      Stage Version 1 were obtained from the North American Association of Central
      Cancer Registries (NAACCR); 47 population-based cancer registries in the United
      States were included. Relative importance analysis was used to identify variables
      that were relatively important in predicting unknown stage. We used multiple
      linear regression to evaluate factors associated with percentage of unknown stage
      by cancer site using state central cancer registries as analytic units; potential
      outlier registries with high percentage of unstaged cases were identified using
      boxplots and standardized residuals. Results: Overall, lung cancer had the
      highest percentage of unknown stage (8.3%) and prostate cancer had the largest
      variation of unknown stage among registries (0.6%–18.1%). The percentages of
      neoplasm Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) histology, non-microscopically
      confirmation, and non-hospital reporting source were positively associated
      (p<0.05) with percentage of unknown stage for all studied cancer sites before
      adjustment. Variables that retained a positive association with unknown stage
      after adjusted for demographic variables, clinical variables, year of diagnosis, 
      and type of reporting source were black race, metropolitan area < 1 million
      population, histologies of neoplasm NOS or epithelial neoplasm NOS, diagnosis
      year 2005, and non-hospital reporting source for colorectal cancer; metropolitan 
      area < 1 million population, neoplasm NOS histology, and non-hospital reporting
      source for female breast; and diagnosis year 2005 and non-hospital reporting
      source for prostate. After adjustment, none of the predictors were significant
      for lung cancer. We observed one potential outlier registry each for colorectal, 
      lung, and female cancers. Conclusions: Factors associated with unknown stage
      differ by cancer site; however, type of reporting source is an important
      predictor of unknown stage for all cancers except lung after adjustment. Cancer
      registries with high percentage of unknown stage should be made aware of their
      data quality issue(s). As a result, these registries can investigate those
      factors and provide training to registrars to improve their cancer data quality.

TI  - Optimal parameters for clinical implementation of breast cancer patient setup
      using Varian DTS software.
PG  - 60-73
AB  - Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) was evaluated as an alternative to cone‐beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) for patient setup. DTS is preferable when there are constraints
      with setup time, gantry‐couch clearance, and imaging dose using CBCT. This study 
      characterizes DTS data acquisition and registration parameters for the setup of
      breast cancer patients using nonclinical Varian DTS software. DTS images were
      reconstructed from CBCT projections acquired on phantoms and patients with
      surgical clips in the target volume. A shift‐and‐add algorithm was used for DTS
      volume reconstructions, while automated cross‐correlation matches were performed 
      within Varian DTS software. Triangulation on two short DTS arcs separated by
      various angular spread was done to improve 3D registration accuracy. Software
      performance was evaluated on two phantoms and ten breast cancer patients using
      the registration result as an accuracy measure; investigated parameters included 
      arc lengths, arc orientations, angular separation between two arcs,
      reconstruction slice spacing, and number of arcs. The shifts determined from
      DTS‐to‐CT registration were compared to the shifts based on CBCT‐to‐CT
      registration. The difference between these shifts was used to evaluate the
      software accuracy. After findings were quantified, optimal parameters for the
      clinical use of DTS technique were determined. It was determined that at least
      two arcs were necessary for accurate 3D registration for patient setup.
      Registration accuracy of 2 mm was achieved when the reconstruction arc length was
      > 5° for clips with HU ≥ 1000°; larger arc length (≥ 8°) was required for very
      low HU clips. An optimal arc separation was found to be ≥ 20° and optimal arc
      length was 10°. Registration accuracy did not depend on DTS slice spacing. DTS
      image reconstruction took 10–30 seconds and registration took less than 20
      seconds. The performance of Varian DTS software was found suitable for the
      accurate setup of breast cancer patients. Optimal data acquisition and
      registration parameters were determined.PACS numbers: 87.57.‐s, 87.57.nf,

TI  - Screening mammogram microcalcification due to basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
PG  - e90-1
AB  - Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy worldwide, typically
      presenting as a pearly or translucent papule. Histologically, approximately 21%
      contain areas of microcalcification. We report a case of a woman presenting with 
      microcalcification on screening mammography that was suspicious. Repeated core
      biopsies did not obtain microcalcification, and a diagnostic excision of breast
      tissue and overlying skin revealed an intradermal basal cell carcinoma containing
      the microcalcification. No breast malignancy was present. We believe this is the 
      second such reported case in the literature and the first to be reported in
      Europe.

TI  - Impact of the Tiloop Bra mesh in CT images and dose delivery in breast
      radiotherapy.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - A new titanized breast mesh, TiLOOP Bra, is currently available for implantation 
      in patients who require radiotherapy. The purpose of this work is to study the
      dosimetric effect of the presence of a TiLOOP Bra mesh on breast radiation
      treatment and radiographic imaging. The dosimetric effects have been measured for
      three X‐ray energies: 1.25 MeV, 6 MV and 18 MV, using radiochromic films placed
      at three different depths. These depths are representative of mesh location in
      breast during the radiotherapy treatment and hence, are of interest in this
      study. In order to assess the disturbance in a radiographic image, different
      computed tomographic (CT) studies of the mesh have been performed. The absorbed
      dose differences with and without the mesh are less than 1%. No metallic
      artifacts have been observed in radiographic images associated with the mesh, nor
      significant disturbances in Hounsfield Units. The TiLOOP Bra mesh does not
      disturb the dosimetry of a typical radiotherapy treatment and its influence in
      the quality of the CT scan required for planning is negligible.PACS number:

TI  - Influence of false-positive mammography results on subsequent screening: do
      physician recommendations buffer negative effects?
PG  - 35-41
AB  - Objective: Cancer screening guidelines often include discussion about the
      unintended negative consequences of routine screening. This prospective study
      examined effects of false-positive mammography results on women’s adherence to
      subsequent breast cancer screening and psychological well-being. We also assessed
      whether barriers to screening exacerbated the effects of false-positive results. 
      Methods: We conducted secondary analyses of data from telephone interviews and
      medical claims records for 2406 insured women. The primary outcome was adherence 
      to screening guidelines, defined as adherent (10–14 months), delayed (15–34
      months), or no subsequent mammogram on record. Results: About 8% of women
      reported that their most recent screening mammograms produced false-positive
      results. In the absence of self-reported advice from their physicians to be
      screened, women were more likely to have no subsequent mammograms on record if
      they received false-positive results than if they received normal results (18%
      vs. 7%, OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.30, 7.70). Receipt of false-positive results was
      not associated with this outcome for women who said their physicians had advised 
      regular screening in the past year (7% vs. 10%, OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.38, 1.45). 
      False-positive results were associated with greater breast cancer worry (P <
      .01), thinking more about the benefits of screening (P < .001), and belief that
      abnormal test results do not mean women have cancer (P < .01), regardless of
      physicians’ screening recommendations. Conclusion: False-positive mammography
      results, coupled with reports that women’s physicians did not advise regular
      screening, could lead to non-adherence to future screening. Abnormal mammograms
      that do not result in cancer diagnoses are opportunities for physicians to stress
      the importance of regular screening.

TI  - Incremental increase in VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and VEGFR2+
      endothelial progenitor cells predicts relapse and lack of tumor response in
      breast cancer patients.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - Purpose: Animal models have demonstrated the critical role of bone marrow-derived
      VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and VEGFR2+ endothelial progenitor 
      cells (EPCs) in metastatic progression. We explored whether these cells could
      predict relapse and response in breast cancer (BC) patients. Experimental Design:
      132 patients with stages 1 to 4 BC were enrolled on 2 studies. Circulating
      CD45+/CD34+/VEGFR1+ HPCs and CD45dim/CD133+/VEGFR2+ EPCs were assessed from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells using flow cytometry. Changes in HPCs and EPCs
      were analyzed in 1) patients without overt disease that relapsed and 2)
      metastatic patients according to response by RECIST. Results: At study entry, 102
      patients were without evidence of disease and 30 patients had metastatic BC.
      Seven patients without evidence of BC by exam, labs, and imaging developed
      recurrence while on study. Median HPC/mL (range) increased from 645.8
      (23.5-1914), p=0.016, followed by an increase in median EPC/mL from 21.3
      (4.7-42.5) to 94.7 (28.2-201.3), p=0.016, prior to clinical relapse. In
      metastatic patients with progressive disease, median HPC/mL increased from 1696
      (10-16470) to 5124 (374-77605), p=0.0009, and median EPC/mL increased from 26
      (0-560) to 71 (0-615) prior to progression, p=0.10. In patients with responding
      disease, median HPC/mL decreased from 6147 (912-85070) to 633 (47-18065), p=0.05,
      and EPC/mL decreased from 46 (0-197) to 23 (0-105), p=0.41, at response. There
      were no significant changes in these cells over time in patients with stable
      disease. Conclusions: Circulating bone marrow-derived HPCs and EPCs predict
      relapse and disease progression in BC patients.

TI  - Deformable registration using edge‐preserving scale space for adaptive
      image‐guided radiation therapy.
PG  - 105-23
AB  - Incorporating of daily cone‐beam computer tomography (CBCT) image into online
      radiation therapy process can achieve adaptive image‐guided radiation therapy
      (AIGRT). Registration of planning CT (PCT) and daily CBCT are the key issues in
      this process. In our work, a new multiscale deformable registration method is
      proposed by combining edge‐preserving scale space with the multilevel free‐form
      deformation (FFD) grids for CBCT‐based AIGRT system. The edge‐preserving scale
      space, which is able to select edges and contours of images according to their
      geometric size, is derived from the total variation model with the L1 norm
      (TV‐L1). At each scale, despite the noise and contrast resolution differences
      between the PCT and CBCT, the selected edges and contours are sufficiently strong
      to drive the deformation using the FFD grid, and the edge‐preserving property
      ensures more meaningful spatial information for mutual information (MI)‐based
      registration. At last, the deformation fields are gained by a coarse to fine
      manner. Furthermore, in consideration of clinical application we designed an
      optimal estimation of the TV‐L1 parameters by minimizing the defined offset
      function for automated registration.Six types of patients are studied in our
      work, including rectum, prostate, lung, H&N (head and neck), breast, and chest
      cancer patients. The experiment results demonstrate the significance of the
      proposed method both quantitatively with ground truth known and qualitatively
      with ground truth unknown. The applications for AIGRT, including adaptive
      deformable recontouring and redosing, and DVH (dose volume histogram) analysis in
      the course of radiation therapy are also studied.PACS numbers: 87.57.Gg,

TI  - Predictors of timing of adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with hormone
      receptor–negative, stages II–III breast cancer.
PG  - 207-16
AB  - Adherence to consensus guidelines for cancer care may vary widely across health
      care settings and contribute to differences in cancer outcomes. For some women
      with breast cancer, omission of adjuvant chemotherapy or delays in its initiation
      may contribute to differences in cancer recurrence and mortality. We studied
      adjuvant chemotherapy use among women with stage II or stage III, hormone
      receptor–negative breast cancer to understand health system and socio-demographic
      correlates of under-use and delayed adjuvant chemotherapy. We used Surveillance
      Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data to examine the patterns 
      of care for 6,678 women aged 65 and older diagnosed with stage II or stage III
      hormone receptor–negative breast cancer in 1994–2002, with claims data through
      2007. Age-stratified logistic regression was employed to examine the potential
      role of socio-demographic and structural/organizational health services
      characteristics in explaining differences in adjuvant chemotherapy initiation.
      Overall utilization of guideline-recommended adjuvant chemotherapy peaked at 43% 
      in this population. Increasing age, higher co-morbidity burden, and low-income
      status were associated with lower odds of chemotherapy initiation within 4
      months, whereas having positive lymph nodes, more advanced disease, and being
      married were associated with higher odds (P < 0.05). Health system–related
      structural/organizational characteristics and race/ethnicity offered little
      explanatory insight. Timely initiation of guideline-recommended adjuvant
      chemotherapy was low, with significant variation by age, income, and co-morbidity
      status. Based on these findings, future studies should seek to explore the more
      nuanced reasons why older women do not receive chemotherapy and why delays in
      care occur.

TI  - Time and Distance Barriers to Mammography Facilities in the Atlanta Metropolitan 
      Area.
PG  - 675-83
AB  - To a great extent, research on geographic accessibility to mammography facilities
      has focused on urban–rural differences. Spatial accessibility within urban areas 
      can nonetheless pose a challenge, especially for minorities and low-income urban 
      residents who are more likely to depend on public transportation. To examine
      spatial and temporal accessibility to mammography facilities in the Atlanta
      metropolitan area by public and private transportation, we built a multimodal
      transportation network model including bus and rail routes, bus and rail stops,
      transfers, walk times, and wait times. Our analysis of travel times from the
      population-weighted centroids of the 282 census tracts in the 2-county area to
      the nearest facility found that the median public transportation time was almost 
      51 minutes. We further examined public transportation travel times by levels of
      household access to a private vehicle. Residents in tracts with the lowest
      household access to a private vehicle had the shortest travel times, suggesting
      that facilities were favorably located for women who have to use public
      transportation. However, census tracts with majority non-Hispanic black
      populations had the longest travel times for all levels of vehicle availability. 
      Time to the nearest mammography facility would not pose a barrier to women who
      had access to a private vehicle. This study adds to the literature demonstrating 
      differences in spatial accessibility to health services by race/ethnicity and
      socioeconomic characteristics. Ameliorating spatial inaccessibility represents an
      opportunity for intervention that operates at the population level.

TI  - Estimated Effects of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection
      Program on Breast Cancer Mortality.
PG  - 397-404
AB  - Background: The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program
      (NBCCEDP) provides breast cancer screening to medically underserved, low-income
      women aged 40–64 years. No study has evaluated NBCCEDP’s effect on breast cancer 
      mortality. Purpose: This study estimates life-years saved by NBCCEDP breast
      cancer screening compared with screening in the absence of NBCCEDP and with no
      screening. Methods: A breast cancer simulation model based on existing Cancer
      Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models was constructed. The
      screening module from these models was modified to reflect screening frequency
      for NBCCEDP participants. Screening data for uninsured women represented what
      would have happened without the program. Separate simulations were performed for 
      women who received NBCCEDP (Program) screening, women who potentially received
      screening without the program (No Program), and women who received no screening
      (No Screening). The impact of NBCCEDP was estimated as the difference in
      life-years between the Program and No Program, and the Program and No Screening
      scenarios. The analysis was performed in 2008–2009. Results: Among 1.8 million
      women who were screened between 1991 and 2006, the Program saved 100,800
      life-years compared with No Program and 369,000 life-years compared with No
      Screening. Per woman screened, the Program saved 0.056 life-years (95% CI=0.031, 
      0.081) compared with No Program and 0.206 life-years (95% CI=0.177, 0.234)
      compared with No Screening. Per woman with invasive breast cancer and
      screen-detected invasive cancer, the Program saved 0.41 and 0.71 life-years,
      respectively, compared with No Program. Conclusions: These estimates suggest that
      NBCCEDP breast cancer screening has reduced mortality among medically uninsured
      and underinsured low-income women.

TI  - Phase II Study of Bortezomib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in the Treatment
      of Metastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - 465-70
AB  - Background: Based on preclinical studies and a phase I trial of the combination
      of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), which both showed
      activity in breast cancer, we conducted a phase II study of this regimen in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients received
      bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of an every-21-day cycle, along with
      PLD 30 mg/m2 on day 4. The primary objective was to evaluate the response rate of
      this combination, while secondary objectives were to obtain further safety data
      about this combination, to evaluate the time to disease progression (TTP), and to
      evaluate response by the breast cancer subtype. Results: One of 12 evaluable
      patients had a partial response (8%), while 3 (25%) had stable disease. At 26
      months follow-up, the median overall survival was 4.3 months (95% CI, 1.2–26.2)
      and the median TTP was 1.3 months (95% CI, 0.8–14.0 months). The combination was 
      well tolerated, with the most common events including low-grade nausea and
      vomiting, neutropenia, and neuropathy, and no cardiac toxicity was seen. Of the 7
      tumors subtyped, no association was seen between intrinsic subtype or receptor
      status and response. Conclusion: The combination of PLD and bortezomib was well
      tolerated but has minimal activity in heavily pretreated unselected metastatic
      breast cancer.

TI  - Pain in Long-Term Breast Cancer Survivors: Frequency, Severity, and Impact.
PG  - 1099-106
AB  - Objective: To better understand the severity and impact of pain in women who are 
      breast cancer survivors. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Cancer wellness
      clinic. Patients: Two hundred fifty-three women with a history of early-stage
      breast cancer who had completed therapy and were without evidence of disease.
      Interventions: None. Outcome Measures: A survey that included questions about
      cancer history, pain, sleep problems, and physical and psychological functioning.
      Results: About half of the participants (117 or 46%) reported some pain, although
      most rated its intensity as mild. Both average and worst pain ratings showed
      significant associations with physical functioning (rs, −0.48 and −0.43,
      respectively), severity of sleep problems (rs, 0.31 and 0.30), and psychological 
      functioning (rs, −0.27 and −0.24). Age (with younger participants slightly more
      likely to report pain) and history of antiestrogen therapy showed nonsignificant 
      trends to predict the presence of pain. Conclusions: The study findings provide
      new and important knowledge regarding the severity and impact of pain in female
      breast cancer survivors. The results indicate that clinicians should assess pain 
      regularly in breast cancer survivors and treat this pain when indicated. The
      findings also support the need for research to determine whether improved pain
      management would result in improved quality of life for women with a history of
      breast cancer.

TI  - Gene expression pathway analysis to predict response to neoadjuvant docetaxel and
      capecitabine for breast cancer.
PG  - 685-99
AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be equivalent to post-operative
      treatment for breast cancer, and allows for assessment of chemotherapy response. 
      In a pilot trial of docetaxel (T) and capecitabine (X) neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      for Stage II/III BC, we assessed correlation between baseline gene expression and
      tumor response to treatment, and examined changes in gene expression associated
      with treatment. Patients received four cycles of TX. Tumor tissue obtained from
      Mammotome™ core biopsies pretreatment (BL) and post-cycle 1 (C1) of TX was flash 
      frozen and stored at −70°C until processing. Gene expression analysis utilized
      Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Gene-Chip arrays. Statistical analysis was performed 
      using BRB Array Tools after RMA normalization. Gene ontology (GO) pathway
      analysis used random variance t tests with a significance level of P < 0.005. For
      gene categories identified by GO pathway analysis as significant, expression
      levels of individual genes within those pathways were compared between classes
      using univariate t tests; those genes with significance level of P < 0.05 were
      reported. PAM50 analyses were performed on tumor samples to investigate biologic 
      subtype and risk of relapse (ROR). Using GO pathway analysis, 39 gene categories 
      discriminated between responders and non-responders, most notably genes involved 
      in microtubule assembly and regulation. When comparing pre- and post-chemotherapy
      specimens, we identified 71 differentially expressed gene categories, including
      DNA repair and cell proliferation regulation. There were 45 GO pathways in which 
      the change in expression after one cycle of chemotherapy was significantly
      different among responders and non-responders. The majority of tumor samples fell
      into the basal-like and luminal B categories. ROR scores decreased in response to
      chemotherapy; this change was more evident in samples from patients classified as
      responders by clinical criteria. GO pathway analysis identified a number of gene 
      categories pertinent to therapeutic response, and may be an informative method
      for identifying genes important in response to chemotherapy. Larger studies using
      the methods described here are necessary to fully evaluate gene expression
      changes in response to chemotherapy.

TI  - Obesity and Angiolymphatic Invasion in Primary Breast Cancer.
PG  - 752-9
AB  - Background: Obesity is associated with poorer breast cancer-specific survival.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between obesity
      and the presence of angiolymphatic invasion as well as other features of invasive
      breast cancer, including stage at presentation, estrogen receptor (ER) status,
      the triple-negative phenotype, and tumor grade. Methods: Detailed clinical and
      pathologic data were abstracted from the medical records of all 1,312 patients
      with Stage I – III primary breast cancer who had breast surgery at the University
      of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 
      2006. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the
      relationships between body mass index and tumor biologic features controlling for
      menopausal status, diabetes and hypertension, hormone replacement therapy before 
      diagnosis, race, and ethnicity. Results: In multivariate analyses, severe obesity
      was independently associated with the presence of angiolymphatic invasion (odds
      ratio, OR 1.80, 95% C.I. 1.08 to 2.99, joint test of significance, p = 0.03).
      Severe obesity was associated with a lower likelihood of triple-negative breast
      cancer (OR 0.39, 95% C.I. 0.16 to 0.96). Among premenopausal women with diabetes,
      ER-negative (OR 5.22, 95% C.I. 1.22 to 24.29) and triple-negative (OR 14.8, 95%
      C.I. 1.92 to 113.91) disease was significantly more common. Discussion: In this
      large sample of invasive breast cancers, obesity was independently associated
      with the presence of angiolymphatic invasion. Higher rates of angiolymphatic
      invasion among obese women may account in part for the poorer outcomes among
      obese women with breast cancer.

TI  - False Negative Rate of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Multicentric and Multifocal 
      Breast Cancers May be Higher in Cases with Large Additive Tumor Burden.
PG  - 645-8
AB  - We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in
      multicentric ⁄ multifocal breast cancer. In this prospective study, 23 women with
      multicentric ⁄ multifocal breast cancer underwent SLNB at our institution from
      April 2002 to February 2006. Presence of preoperative axillary metastases was
      confirmed by FNA. Patients underwent sub-areolar radiopharmaceutical injection ± 
      isosulfan blue to perform SLNB, then completion ALND. The false-negative (FN)
      rate of SLNB was determined based upon final pathology. Twenty women with
      multicentric and three with multifocal invasive carcinoma were enrolled. The SLN 
      identification rate was 100%. The overall FN rate of SLNB was 15% (95% CI 0.0466,
      0.4281). Both cases with FN SLNB had multicentric disease, pathologic stage III
      breast cancer and a larger tumor burden compared with the study population. SLNB 
      using sub-areolar injection is feasible for patients with multicentric ⁄
      multifocal breast cancer yet may be associated with a higher FN rate in patients 
      with large additive tumor burden.

      refractory metastatic breast cancer: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group
      (NCCTG) Trial.
PG  - 493-7
AB  - Background: Because of the single-agent activity of irinotecan hydrochloride,
      combination of irinotecan and docetaxel treatment against metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) should be evaluated.Patients and methods: Single-stage phase 2 study
      of irinotecan and docetaxel to evaluate tumor response, toxicity, time to
      progression, and overall survival was carried out. Regimen of docetaxel (25
      mg/m2) and irinotecan (70 mg/m2) was administered on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week 
      cycle. Patients had histologically confirmed breast adenocarcinoma and metastatic
      cancer measurable with RECIST.Results: Of 70 patients enrolled, 64 were
      assessable. Prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane was required.
      Eighteen (28%) patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 15% to 31%] had tumor
      response, plus four patients had stable disease (less than 30% decrease in sum of
      longest diameter and less than 20% increase) for >6 months. The clinical benefit 
      rate was 34% overall. Median duration of tumor response was 6.7 months (95% CI
      4.2–37.7 months); median follow-up was 18.6 months (range 8.5–37.7 months). The
      most common severe adverse events included fatigue [n = 16 (25%)] and neutropenia
      [n = 13 (20%)].Conclusions: Weekly dosing of combination of irinotecan and
      docetaxel is active against MBC. However, the response rate to our regimen was
      not significantly better than single-agent docetaxel. Other schedules of
      irinotecan plus docetaxel should be considered for future studies.

TI  - Prospective randomized trial of paravertebral block for patients undergoing
      breast cancer surgery.
PG  - 720-5
AB  - Background: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of regional
      anesthesia using paravertebral block (PVB) on postoperative pain after breast
      surgery. Methods: Patients undergoing unilateral breast surgery without
      reconstruction were randomized to general anesthesia (GA) only or PVB with GA and
      pain scores assessed. Results: Eighty patients were randomized (41 to GA and 39
      to PVB with GA). Operative times were not significantly different between groups.
      Pain scores were lower after PVB compared to GA at 1 hour (1 versus 3, p=0.006)
      and 3 hours (0 versus 2, p=0.001), but not at later time points. The overall
      worst pain experienced was lower with PVB (3 versus 5, p=0.02). More patients
      were pain free in the PVB group at 1 hour (44% versus 17%, p=0.014) and 3 hours
      (54% versus 17%, p=0.005) postoperatively. Conclusions: Paravertebral block
      significantly decreases postoperative pain up to 3 hours after breast cancer
      surgery. Summary: This paper reports on the findings from a prospective
      randomized trial of paravertebral block (PVB) for breast surgery. Paravertebral
      block significantly decreased postoperative pain up to 3 hours after breast
      cancer surgery.

TI  - A Prospective Study Comparing Touch Imprint Cytology, Frozen Section Analysis,
      and Rapid Cytokeratin Immunostain for Intraoperative Evaluation of Axillary
      Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1555-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intraoperative evaluation of axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs)
      allows the surgeon to complete axillary dissection in 1 setting at the time of
      the primary breast surgery. However, to the authors’ knowledge, there is no
      consensus regarding the optimal method for intraoperative evaluation of SLNs in
      breast cancer. The authors of this report prospectively compared touch imprint
      (TI) cytology with frozen section (FS) analysis and rapid cytokeratin
      immunostaining (RCI) of SLNs for the intraoperative evaluation of disease and
      compared the results with final pathologic examination (FP). METHODS: Patients
      with invasive breast carcinoma who were diagnosed with lymph node-negative
      disease (based on preoperative clinical and sonographic evaluation with or
      without fine-needle aspiration of the indeterminate lymph nodes) and who
      subsequently were scheduled for lymphatic mapping were eligible to participate in
      this prospective protocol. TI and FS analysis were performed on all SLNs, and the
      lymph nodes were stained by the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method. RCI was
      performed using the enhanced polymer 1-step cytokeratin method. The results of
      TI, FS, RCI, TI plus FS, and FS plus RCI were compared with the results from FP, 
      including 1 H&E stain and cytokeratin immunostain of the third level. RESULTS:
      One hundred patients with invasive mammary carcinoma were accrued to the study.
      Eighty-five tumors were the ductal type, 8 tumors were lobular, 5 tumors were
      mixed ductal and lobular, 1 was an adenoid cystic tumor, and 1 tumor was
      metaplastic carcinoma. Seventy-two tumors were staged clinically as T1N0M0, 25
      tumors were staged as T2N0M0, and 3 tumors were staged as T3N0M0. Metastatic
      carcinoma was detected in the SLNs by 1 or more methods, including TI, FS, RCI,
      and FP, in 20 tumors, which included 12 macrometastases and 8 micrometastases. TI
      detected 8 of 12 macrometastases (67%), FS detected 12 of 12 macrometastases
      (100%), RCI detected 12 of 12 macrometastases (100%), and FP detected 12 of 12
      macrometastases (100%). TI detected 1 of 8 micrometastases (13%), FS detected 3
      of 8 micrometastases (38%), RCI detected 4 of 8 micrometastases (50%), and FP
      detected 6 of 8 micrometastases (75%). The sensitivities of TI, FS, RCI, TI plus 
      FS, and FS plus RCI (with FP as the gold standard) were 50%, 72%, 78%, and 83%,
      respectively, and the sensitivities of the same intraoperative methods were 45%, 
      75%, 80%, and 85%, respectively, with detection of metastatic disease by any
      method as the gold standard. The specificities of the different methods (with FP 
      as the gold standard) were 100% for TI and 97.5% for FS, RCI, TI plus FS, and FS 
      plus RCI. The specificity of each method was 100% when the detection of
      metastatic disease by any method was regarded as the gold standard. Although the 
      difference in sensitivity between FS and TI was not statistically significant (P 
      = .08), the difference between RCI and TI bordered on significance (P = .046);
      however, FS analysis plus RCI was significantly superior to TI (P = .03) and
      produced results comparable to those of FP. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivities of FS,
      RCI, TI plus FS, and FS plus RCI were better than the sensitivity of TI cytology 
      of axillary SLNs. However, only the combination of FS and RCI was statistically
      superior to TI and generated results comparable to those of FP in SLNs. RCI can
      be completed within the time constraints for intraoperative use and, in
      conjunction with FS, can be useful for generating results closer to those
      generated by FP. FS analysis plus RCI have a role in the intraoperative
      evaluation of SLNs.

TI  - Amplification of the BP1 homeobox gene in breast cancer.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - The homeobox gene BP1 is expressed in over 80% of breast cancers and is
      associated with tumor progression and invasion. However, the mechanism of BP1
      activation in these tumors remains unknown. Therefore our aim in this study is to
      assess the amplification status of the BP1 gene in breast cancer and to determine
      whether BP1 protein expression is caused by gene amplification in these tumors.
      BP1 amplification and expression were assessed in 36 samples. Twenty primary
      breast tumors (PBT) and 14 sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were analyzed
      using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC),
      respectively. Because of the close proximity of BP1 and HER2/NEU genes on 17q,
      correlation between their amplification/expression was also investigated.
      Increased BP1 copy number was observed in 33% of the cases, with a frequency of
      36% and 29% in the PBT and SLN metastasis, respectively. BP1 protein was
      expressed in 91% of the samples: in all of the PBT with increased BP1 copy number
      and 65% of PBT with normal copy number. HER2/NEU amplification was detected in
      22% of the cases. Concordance between BP1 and HER2/NEU copy numbers was found in 
      68% of the PBT and 90% of the SLN metastasis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that
      the BP1 homeobox gene is amplified in breast cancer, both in PBT and SLN
      metastasis, with a significant correlation with HER2/NEU amplification.
      Considering that BP1 expression was observed in cases with both increased and
      normal BP1 copy number, we conclude that other mechanisms in addition to gene
      amplification play a role in BP1 protein expression.

TI  - Physical Activity Behaviors in Women with Newly Diagnosed Ductal
      Carcinoma-In-Situ.
PG  - 106-12
AB  - Epidemiological evidence suggests that physical activity may affect breast cancer
      risk and other health outcomes. Little information is available regarding changes
      in activity after diagnosis and treatment of in-situ cancer. We enrolled 487
      women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) in a longitudinal
      cohort study. Exercise behaviors were assessed at enrollment and at 18 months.
      Changes in exercise frequency over time were compared, and the impact of
      demographic and treatment-related variables was evaluated. Enrollment and
      18-month exercise data were available for 391 women (80%). At enrollment, most
      women performed strenuous physical activity infrequently, and only half engaged
      in any type of exercise more than twice a week. Overall activity patterns did not
      change greatly over the course of the study. However, logistic regression
      modeling of changes in exercise revealed that women who underwent unilateral or
      bilateral mastectomy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
      1.3–4.4) and those who were anxious at enrollment (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–4.1) were
      statistically significantly more likely to decrease exercise levels, and women
      who worked were significantly more likely to increase exercise over the course of
      the study (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.3). Nonsignificant variables included age,
      reconstructive surgery, depressive symptoms, financial status, education, and
      tamoxifen use. A large proportion of women with newly diagnosed DCIS were
      inactive and remained so over time. Women who underwent mastectomy, as well as
      women who were more anxious, were more likely to decrease their level of physical
      activity. Women with DCIS might benefit from targeted interventions to increase
      physical activity.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in primary breast cancers predicts dissemination of
      cancer cells to the bone marrow.
PG  - 61-8
AB  - Purpose: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) plays a role in breast cancer progression at
      various stages starting from pre-malignant phenotype to clinical metastasis.
      Breast cancer metastasizes commonly to the bone and preclinical studies suggest
      an involvement of COX2 in this process. Detection of disseminated tumor cells in 
      the bone marrow of patients at the time of surgery correlates with the subsequent
      development of clinical bone metastasis. Therefore, to investigate whether COX2
      is important for breast cancer metastasis in humans, we analyzed COX2 protein
      expression by immunostaining of primary tumors from 112 operable stages I, II, or
      III patients and determined its correlation with bone marrow micrometastasis
      (BMM). Methods: We detected COX2 protein in primary tumors by immunostaining with
      a monoclonal antibody, and tumor cells present in the bone marrow by
      immunostaining for epithelial cytokeratins and by morphological criteria.
      Results: COX2 expression in primary breast cancer correlated with BMM in a highly
      statistically significant manner (P = 0.006). Our statistical analyses of
      correlations of the COX2 positivity in primary tumor with other clinically
      relevant indicators revealed that COX2 positivity correlates with high nuclear
      grade (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, we were able to detect COX2 protein in BMM by
      immunostaining. Conclusions: These studies indicate that COX2 produced in primary
      breast cancer cells may be vital to the initial development of BMM that may
      subsequently lead to osteolytic bone metastases in patients with breast cancer,
      and that COX2 inhibitors may be useful in halting this process.

TI  - Expression of Aurora A (but Not Aurora B) Is Predictive of Survival in Breast
      Cancer.
PG  - 4455-62
AB  - Purpose: The cell cycle mediators Aurora A and B are targets of drugs currently
      in clinical development. As with other targeted therapies in breast cancer,
      response to therapy might be associated with target expression in tumors. We
      therefore assessed expression of Aurora A and B in breast tumors and studied
      associations with clinical/pathologic variables. Experimental Design: Tissue
      microarrays containing primary specimens from 638 patients with 15-year follow-up
      were employed to assess expression of Aurora A and B using our automated
      quantitative analysis method; we used cytokeratin to define pixels as breast
      cancer (tumor mask) within the array spot and measured Aurora A and B expression 
      within the mask using Cy5-conjugated antibodies. Results: Aurora A and B
      expression was variable in primary breast tumors. High Aurora A expression was
      strongly associated with decreased survival (P = 0.0005). On multivariable
      analysis, it remained an independent prognostic marker. High Aurora A expression 
      was associated with high nuclear grade and high HER-2/neu and progesterone
      receptor expression. Aurora B expression was not associated with survival.
      Conclusions: Aurora A expression defines a population of patients with decreased 
      survival, whereas Aurora B expression does not, suggesting that Aurora A might be
      the preferred drug target in breast cancer. Aurora A expression in early-stage
      breast cancer may identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive or
      pathway-targeted treatment. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the
      prognostic role of Aurora A as well as the predictive role of Aurora A expression
      in patients treated with Aurora A inhibitors.

TI  - HER2 status predicts the presence of circulating tumor cells in patients with
      operable breast cancer.
PG  - 501-7
AB  - Introduction: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) correlate with worse prognosis in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer, but there are little data on CTCs in
      operable patients. We hypothesized that primary tumor characteristics would
      predict the likelihood of identifying CTCs in patients with operable breast
      cancer. Methods: Clinical and pathological data from 92 patients with operable
      breast cancer were collected. The CellSearch system was used to detect CTCs in 30
      ml of peripheral blood. CTCs were defined as nucleated cells lacking CD45 but
      expressing cytokeratins 8, 18, or 19. Univariate analysis was performed to
      determine if the presence of any primary tumor characteristic was predictive of
      CTCs. As a secondary objective we evaluated if nodal or bone marrow status was
      predictive of CTCs. Results: Thirty-eight percent of patients (35/92) had
      evidence of CTCs, with a median number of 1.0 CTC per CTC positive patient (range
      1–22). HER2 status was the sole primary tumor characteristic that reliably
      predicted the presence of CTCs (P = 0.01, risk ratio = 3.66). No significant
      association was found between the presence of CTCs and tumor size (T), estrogen
      receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, grade, histologic type, 
      degree of nodal involvement (N), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) or Ki-67
      proliferation. Bone marrow micrometastases were found in 17/64 (26.6%) of the
      patients but did not correlate with the presence of CTCs. Conclusion: HER2 status
      was the only primary tumor characteristic that correlated with the presence of
      CTCs. Long-term follow-up will be required to determine the significance of CTCs 
      in operable breast cancer.

AB  - This study examined associations between optimism, social support, and distress
      as they relate to psychosexual well-being among 136 women with Stage 0, I, and II
      breast cancer. Women were assessed immediately post-surgery and 3, 6, and 12
      months post-surgery. Results support two cross-sectional mediation models. The
      first model indicates that patients who are more optimistic experience greater
      psychosexual well-being (i.e., feel more feminine, attractive, and sexually
      desirable) partly because they perceive themselves as having more social support 
      available. The second model indicates that patients who are more optimistic
      experience greater psychosexual well-being partly because they experience less
      emotional distress related to the disease. When the two models were tested
      simultaneously, distress no longer contributed uniquely to the model at any time 
      point except for 12 months follow-up.

TI  - Digital mammography: Comparative performance of color LCD and monochrome CRT
      displays.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate the comparative performance of
      high-fidelity liquid crystal display (LCD) and cathode ray tube (CRT) devices for
      mammography applications, and to assess the impact of LCD viewing angle on
      detection accuracy. Materials and Methods: Ninety 1k × 1k images were selected
      from a database of digital mammograms: 30 without any abnormality present, 30
      with subtle masses, and 30 with subtle microcalcifications. The images were used 
      with waived informed consent, HIPAA compliance, and IRB approval. With
      post-processing presentation identical to those of the commercial mammography
      system used, 1k × 1k sections of images were viewed on a monochrome CRT and a
      color LCD in native grayscale, and with a grayscale representative of images
      viewed from a 30° or 50° off-normal viewing angle. Randomized images were
      independently scored by four experienced breast radiologists for the presence of 
      lesions using a 0–100 grading scale. To compare diagnostic performance of the
      display modes, observer scores were analyzed using Receiver Operating
      Characteristic (ROC) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results: For masses and
      microcalcifications, the detection rate in terms of the area under the ROC curve 
      (Az) showed a 2% increase and a 4% decrease from CRT to LCD, respectively.
      However, differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The viewing
      angle data showed better microcalcification detection but lower mass detection at
      30° viewing orientation. The overall results varied notably from observer to
      observer yielding no statistically discernable trends across all observers,
      suggesting that within the 0–50° viewing angle range and in a controlled observer
      experiment, the variation in the contrast response of the LCD has little or no
      impact on the detection of mammographic lesions. Conclusions: While CRTs and LCDs
      differ in terms of angular response, resolution, noise, and color, these
      characteristics seem to have little influence on the detection of mammographic
      lesions. The results suggest comparable performance in clinical applications of
      the two devices.

TI  - Reduction of Cancer-Specific Thought Intrusions and Anxiety Symptoms With a
      Stress Management Intervention Among Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast
      Cancer.
PG  - 1791-7
AB  - Objective: After surgery for breast cancer, many women experience anxiety
      relating to the cancer that can adversely affect quality of life and emotional
      functioning during the year postsurgery. Symptoms such as intrusive thoughts may 
      be ameliorated during this period with a structured, group-based cognitive
      behavior intervention. Method: A 10-week group cognitive behavior stress
      management intervention that included anxiety reduction (relaxation training),
      cognitive restructuring, and coping skills training was tested among 199 women
      newly treated for stage 0-III breast cancer. They were then followed for 1 year
      after recruitment. Results: The intervention reduced reports of thought
      intrusion, interviewer ratings of anxiety, and emotional distress across 1 year
      significantly more than was seen with the control condition. The beneficial
      effects were maintained well past the completion of adjuvant therapy.
      Conclusions: Structured, group-based cognitive behavior stress management may
      ameliorate cancer-related anxiety during active medical treatment for breast
      cancer and for 1 year following treatment. Group-based cognitive behavior stress 
      management is a clinically useful adjunct to offer to women treated for breast
      cancer.

TI  - HDR brachytherapy combined with 3D conformal versus IMRT in left‐sided breast
      cancer patients including internal mammary chain: Comparative analysis of
      dosimetric and technical parameters.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - Treatment of the internal mammary chain (IMC) with radiation therapy (RT) for
      patients with breast cancer remains a controversial issue. Different treatment
      techniques have been proposed, including oblique electrons, electron‐photon
      combination, and partially wide tangents (PWTs). However, the residual heart dose
      can remain significant mainly for left‐sided lesions. With PWTs and
      intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), respiratory movement and errors in IMC
      localization remain a problem. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact
      of IMC brachytherapy (IMCBT) combined with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT)
      planning on heart, lung, and contralateral breast doses compared with IMRT. All
      plans including IMCBT plus 3DCRT were done on PLATO; IMRT plans were generated
      using the Cadplan‐Helios inverse treatment‐planning software module with the
      “sliding window&rdquo; technique. Dose‐volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated
      for all volumes of interest. Conformity and homogeneity index was also calculated
      for the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distribution in the surrounding normal
      tissue was evaluated. The mean conformity of the PTV was found to be 1.06 with
      IMCBT plus 3DCRT and 1.12 with IMRT. The mean homogeneity (HI95/107) was found to
      be 1.4 with IMCBT plus 3DCRT and 3.32 with IMRT. Using the IMCBT plus 3DCRT
      technique, the mean dose to the heart, contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung,
      and contralateral lung decreased with values of 32%, 6.76%, 20% and 5.52%,
      respectively, compared with IMRT. This novel technique of IMCBT plus 3DCRT can
      potentially reduce the dose to the heart and lungs. In addition, it rivals IMRT
      because of its unique advantages in localization, obviating the need for
      respiratory gating and maximum sparing of heart and other structures.PACS

TI  - An improved internal mammary irradiation technique in radiation treatment of
      locally advanced breast cancers.
PG  - 84-93
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to compare a new internal mammary
      irradiation technique with traditional techniques for locally advanced breast
      cancers in terms of sparing ipsilateral lung and heart and reducing the “cold”
      and “hot spots” in breast tissue. The new technique uses wide tangential fields
      for the first eight fractions of treatment. A medial internal mammary field (IMF)
      of electrons matched with narrowed tangential fields is used for the remaining
      fractions. Intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) by means of segmented
      multileaf collimation (SMLC) is used in the narrowed tangential fields to improve
      the match between the electron and the photon fields. Treatment planning was
      performed to compare this technique to a wide‐tangential‐only technique and to a 
      traditional oblique IMF technique for three patients with differing habitus. Film
      dosimetry was performed in a solid water phantom to confirm the planning results.
      For all three patients, the mean doses of the ipsilateral lung and the heart were
      significantly reduced with the new technique. The lung and the heart volumes were
      remarkably reduced at low‐dose levels (≤12GY) compared to the traditional IMF
      technique, and significantly reduced at all dose levels compared to the wide
      tangential technique. The new technique also reduced the “cold” and “hot spots”
      along the match plane between the IMF and the tangential fields compared to the
      traditional IMF technique. In conclusion, the new IMF technique shows dosimetric 
      improvement compared to the traditional IMF technique in terms of the critical
      organ sparing and target dose uniformity.PACS number: 87.53.Tf

TI  - Anthropomorphic breast phantoms for quality assurance and dose verification.
PG  - 36-49
AB  - An evaluation of two anthropomorphic breast phantoms, which have been designed
      for quality assurance and dose verification of radiotherapy treatment of breast
      cancer patients, is presented. These phantoms are identical in terms of their
      dimensions and shape and composed of several layers of either Plastic Water™ or
      tissue‐equivalent material. Both water‐and tissue‐equivalent phantoms include
      lung‐ and rib‐equivalent components. The phantoms simulate large, medium and
      small breasts. The value of the phantoms as breast treatment quality assurance
      tools was assessed by dose measurements with ionization chamber and
      thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) at different points inside the phantom.
      Measurements were made by irradiating the phantoms under conditions representing 
      the different treatment techniques found by the Radiological Physics Center (RPC)
      during its dosimetry quality audits. Most irradiations were performed with the
      water‐equivalent breast phantom. One experiment was performed under consistent
      irradiation conditions to compare the tissue‐equivalent phantom with the
      water‐equivalent phantom. Measurements were compared with the dose estimated by
      the RPC's manual calculations used to check clinical charts of patients entered
      in a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) protocol.
      Measurements were also compared with isodose distributions generated by a
      commercial radiation treatment planning (RTP) system. In the homogeneous
      three‐dimensional (3‐D) phantom, fairly good agreement (within 5%) was observed
      at the NSABP dose prescription point between measurements and 2‐D dose estimation
      by manual calculations. At the same dose prescription point, but located in the
      heterogeneous 3‐D phantom, agreement between measurements and a 3‐D RTP system
      was within about 3%. Manual calculation resulted in overestimation of up to 6%.
      The general agreement between the TLD measurements and the 2‐D RTP values was
      within 3% at various off‐axis points, with the exception of a few points far
      off‐axis, near the high‐dose gradient region at the surface of the phantom.PACS

TI  - Monitor unit calculation for tangential breast treatments: Verification in an
      anthropomorphic phantom.
PG  - 235-40
AB  - This paper presents an anthropomorphic phantom study of dose delivered to a
      specific point during tangential breast irradiation to verify monitor unit
      calculations. Measurements were made using a 0.6 cc Farmer type cylindrical
      ionization chamber in the phantom and compared to calculations made on a
      three‐dimensional radiotherapy treatment planning system using single digitized
      contour through to multi slice CT data. A large breast phantom was used for a
      single field size with a combination of open and wedged fields for three
      different energies (4, 6, and 18 MV). Solid flat phantom measurements were also
      performed for comparison. Results showed a lower calculated dose than the dose
      measured for a fixed number of monitor units where the variations were within a
      range of 0.8% to 4.5%. Differences were larger for the anthropomorphic phantom
      than the flat phantom. We conclude that little accuracy is gained from CT based
      monitor unit calculations compared to those based on digitised contours for this 
      breast treatment but that the dose distributions will be affected. This type of
      test is recommended as one of a large set, in the commissioning and testing
      procedures for treatment planning systems.PACS number(s): 87.52.Df, 87.53.Dq,

TI  - Verification of the accuracy of 3D calculations of breast dose during tangential 
      irradiation: measurements in a breast phantom.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - This report specifically describes the use of a unique anthropomorphic breast
      phantom to validate the accuracy of three‐dimensional dose calculations performed
      by a commercial treatment‐planning system for intact‐breast tangential
      irradiation. The accuracy of monitor‐unit calculations has been corroborated
      using ionization chamber measurements made in this phantom. Measured doses have
      been compared to those calculated from a variety of treatment plans. The
      treatment plans utilized a 6‐MV x‐ray beam and incorporated a variety of field
      configurations and wedge combinations. Dose measurements at several clinically
      relevant points within the breast phantom have confirmed the accuracy of
      calculated doses generated from the variety of treatment plans. Overall agreement
      between measurements and calculations averaged 0.998±0.009. These results
      indicate that the dose per monitor‐unit calculations performed by the
      treatment‐planning system can be confidently utilized in the fulfillment of
      clinical dose prescriptions.PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.66.–a

AB  - The accuracy of the photon convolution/superposition dose algorithm employed in a
      commercial radiation treatment planning system was evaluated for conditions
      simulating tangential breast treatment. A breast phantom was fabricated from
      machineable wax and placed on the chest wall of an anthropomorphic phantom.
      Radiographic film was used to measure the dose distribution at the axial midplane
      of the breast phantom. Subsequently, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were
      used to measure the dose at four points within the midplane to validate the
      accuracy of the film dosimetry. Film measurements were compared with calculations
      performed using the treatment planning system for four types of treatment:
      optimized wedged beams at 6 and 18 MV and two‐dimensional compensated beams at 6 
      and 18 MV. Both the film‐ and TLD‐measured doses had a precision of approximately
      0.6%. The film‐measured doses were approximately 1.5% lower than the TLD‐measured
      doses, ranging from 0–3 % at 6 MV and 0.5–1 % at 18 MV. Such results placed a
      high level of confidence in the accuracy and precision of the film data. The
      measured and calculated doses agreed to within ±3% for both the film and TLD
      measurements throughout the midplane exclusive of areas not having charged
      particle equilibrium. Good agreement was not expected within these regions due to
      the limitations in both film dosimetry and the dose‐calculation algorithm. These 
      results indicated that the treatment planning system calculates doses at the
      midplane with clinically acceptable accuracy in conditions simulating tangential 
      breast treatment.PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.66.–a

PG  - 58-67
AB  - In this paper a method of breast cancer treatment planning using virtual
      simulation implemented at the Department of Human Oncology at the University of
      Wisconsin is described. All patients in this procedure are placed in a custom
      vacuum mold in treatment position with both arms up to avoid collision with the
      CT scanner aperture. For all patients a CT scan of 5‐mm‐slice thickness is
      acquired. The ipsilateral and contralateral breast, the ipsilateral lung and the 
      heart are delineated and a three‐dimensional plan is generated that tries to
      minimize the dose to the ipsilateral lung and heart while ensuring adequate
      coverage of the affected breast. Digitally reconstructed radiographs are used to 
      verify the patient setup on the treatment machine. © 2000 American College of
