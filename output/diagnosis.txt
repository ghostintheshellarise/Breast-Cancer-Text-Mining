TI  - Changes in ischemia-modified albumin in myocardial toxicity induced by
      anthracycline and docetaxel chemotherapy.
LID - e7681
AB  - This study aims to evaluate differences in myocardial toxicity induced by
      different chemotherapy regimens. Patients were divided into 2 groups: epirubicin 
      (EPI) combined with cyclophosphamide (EC) group and docetaxel combined with
      cyclophosphamide (TC) group. Changes in electrocardiograph (ECG) and
      ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) were determined pre- and 1, 3, and 6 courses of
      postchemotherapy. After the first course of chemotherapy, there was no
      significant difference in ECG and abnormal IMA incidence rates between the TC
      groups and EC groups (P > .05). After the third course and at the end of the
      sixth course, ECG and abnormal IMA incidence rates in the EC group were
      significantly higher than in the TC group (P < .05). Besides, IMA values
      significantly increased with the increase in chemotherapy courses in the EC
      group; and the value of the postsixth course was significantly higher than in the
      pre- and postfirst and -third courses of chemotherapy. IMA value in the postsixth
      course in the TC group was significantly higher than that in the pre- and
      postfirst and -third courses of chemotherapy. In addition, IMA values at the
      postfirst and -third courses of chemotherapy in the EC group were significantly
      higher than in the TC group. Both EC and TC chemotherapy regimens were harmful to
      the myocardium, and the incidence rate of myocardial damage increased with the
      increase of cumulative dose. Besides, the degree of myocardial damage in EC group
      was significantly higher than in the TC group.

TI  - Development of mammary hyperplasia, dysplasia, and invasive ductal carcinoma in
      transgenic mice expressing the 8p11 amplicon oncogene NSD3.
PG  - 349-58
AB  - Purpose: NSD3 has been implicated as a candidate driver oncogene from the
      8p11-p12 locus, and we have previously published evidence for its amplification
      and overexpression in human breast cancer. This aim of this study was to further 
      characterize the transforming function of NSD3 in vivo. Methods: We generated a
      transgenic mouse model in which NSD3 gene expression was driven by the MMTV
      promoter and expressed in mammary epithelium of FVB mice. Mammary glands were
      fixed and whole mounts were stained with carmine to visualize gland structure.
      Mammary tumors were formalin-fixed, and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumors were
      stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Results: Pups born to transgenic females were
      significantly underdeveloped compared to pups born to WT females due to a
      lactation defect in transgenic female mice. Whole mount analysis of the mammary
      glands of transgenic female mice revealed a profound defect in functional
      differentiation of mammary gland alveoli that resulted in the lactation defect.
      We followed parous and virgin NSD3 transgenic and control mice to 50 weeks of age
      and observed that several NSD3 parous females developed mammary tumors. Whole
      mount analysis of the mammary glands of tumor-bearing mice revealed numerous
      areas of mammary hyperplasia and ductal dysplasia. Histological analysis showed
      that mammary tumors were high-grade ductal carcinomas, and lesions present in
      other mammary glands exhibited features of alveolar hyperplasia, ductal
      dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with
      our previous studies and demonstrate that NSD3 is a transforming breast cancer
      oncogene.

TI  - BRCA Genetic Testing and Receipt of Preventive Interventions Among Women Aged
      18–64 Years with Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance in Nonmetropolitan and
      Metropolitan Areas — United States, 2009–2014.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Problem/Condition: Genetic testing for breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 
      2 (BRCA2) gene mutations can identify women at increased risk for breast and
      ovarian cancer. These testing results can be used to select preventive
      interventions and guide treatment. Differences between nonmetropolitan and
      metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive
      interventions after testing have not previously been examined. Period Covered:
      2009–2014. Description of System: Medical claims data from Truven Health
      Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases were used to
      estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA
      testing among women aged 18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance in 
      metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States, both nationally and 
      regionally. Results: From 2009 to 2014, BRCA testing rates per 100,000 women aged
      18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance increased 2.3 times (102.7
      to 237.8) in metropolitan areas and 3.0 times (64.8 to 191.3) in nonmetropolitan 
      areas. The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and
      nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37% in 2009 (102.7 versus 64.8) to 20% in
      2014 (237.8 versus 191.3). The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between 
      metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased more over time in younger women 
      than in older women and decreased in all regions except the West. Receipt of
      preventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus
      nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service: the percentage of 
      women who received a mastectomy was similar, the percentage of women who received
      magnetic resonance imaging of the breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas (as
      low as 5.8% in 2014 to as high as 8.2% in 2011) than metropolitan areas (as low
      as 7.3% in 2014 to as high as 10.3% in 2011), and the percentage of women who
      received mammography was lower in nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was 
      similar in later years. Interpretation: Possible explanations for the 47%
      decrease in the relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the study period
      include increased access to genetic services in nonmetropolitan areas and
      increased demand nationally as a result of publicity. The relative differences in
      metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were smaller among women at
      younger ages compared with older ages. Public Health Action: Improved data
      sources and surveillance tools are needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA
      testing in the United States, monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for 
      BRCA testing, and assess receipt of preventive interventions for women with BRCA 
      mutations. Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic disparities in
      receipt of BRCA testing while simultaneously educating the public and health care
      providers about U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations and other
      clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and counseling.

TI  - Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer, mimicking primary gastric
      cancer: A case report.
LID - e0258
AB  - Rationale:: Gastric metastasis from invasive lobular breast cancer is relatively 
      rare, commonly presented among multiple metastases, several years after primary
      diagnosis of breast cancer. Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronously
      presented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastric
      cancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required. Patient
      concerns:: A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because of right
      breast mass and progressive dyspepsia. Diagnoses:: Invasive lobular carcinoma of 
      breast was diagnosed on core needle biopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse
      scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrum and diagnosed as poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronous double primary breast and gastric cancers
      were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical
      studies of selected antibodies, including those of estrogen receptors, gross
      cystic disease fluid protein-15, and caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2,
      were studied. As a result, gastric lesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric
      cancer originating from breast. Interventions:: Right breast conserving surgery
      was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to
      relieve the patient's symptoms. Systemic chemotherapy with combined
      administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Outcomes:: Forty-one 
      months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoing the same therapy. No 
      recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast and evidence of a partial
      remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed on follow-up studies
      without new metastatic lesions. Lessons:: Clinical suspicion, repeat endoscopic
      biopsy, and detailed histological analysis, including immunohistochemistry, are
      necessary for diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer from the breast.

TI  - The prognostic value of circulating cell-free DNA in breast cancer: A
      meta-analysis.
LID - e0197
AB  - Background:: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma or serum by
      noninvasive procedures can serve as a “liquid biopsy” and has potential as a
      biomarker for the tumor burden and survival prediction of breast cancer (BC).
      However, its prognostic value in patients with BC is currently under debate. The 
      aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA and
      survival outcome. Methods:: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and
      Science Citation Index electronic databases for studies about the prognostic
      utility of cfDNA in patients with BC. The clinical characteristics,
      relapse/disease-free survival (RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were
      extracted from the eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated and pooled with a fixed-effects model using the
      Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.
      Results:: This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127
      patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations between
      cfDNA and OS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.83–3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR = 2.73, 95%
      CI, 2.04–3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in the
      studies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that the
      adjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83–3.51), which is close to the original HR.
      Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker in
      patients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source,
      detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area. Conclusions:: Our
      meta-analysis indicates that cfDNA is a strong predictive and prognostic marker
      in patients with BC.

TI  - Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first‐line treatment for advanced
      breast cancer: A Japanese phase II study.
PG  - 803-13
AB  - This single‐arm, open‐label, phase II study in 42 Japanese postmenopausal
      patients with estrogen receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2‐negative (ER+/HER2−) advanced breast cancer evaluated the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of first‐line palbociclib (125 mg once daily, 3 weeks on/1 week 
      off) coadministered with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily). Primary endpoint of
      investigator‐assessed 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) probability was
      75.0% (90% CI, 61.3%‐84.4%), far surpassing the 40% lower limit of the 90% CI
      supporting efficacy. Median duration of treatment was 438 days. Among secondary
      efficacy measures, median PFS was not reached (95% CI, 16.7: not estimable),
      17/42 patients (40.5%) had an objective response, 36/42 (85.7%) maintained
      disease control, and 27/42 (64.3%) remained in follow‐up. Median overall survival
      was not reached, and 1‐year survival probability was 92.9% (95% CI, 79.5%‐97.6%).
      Results of intensive pharmacokinetics in a subset of 6 patients showed
      palbociclib steady‐state mean area under the plasma concentration‐time curve over
      the dosing interval [τ] and mean maximum plasma concentration were 1979 ng·h/mL
      and 124.7 ng/mL, respectively. For day 15 plasma samples from cycles 1 and 2,
      geometric mean of the within‐patient mean trough concentration was 90.1 ng/mL.
      The most common treatment‐related adverse events were neutropenia (100%) and
      stomatitis (73.8%). There was 1 case of treatment‐related febrile neutropenia.
      Toxicities were generally tolerated and manageable by dose modifications and/or
      medical care. Efficacy and safety of first‐line palbociclib plus letrozole
      therapy is supported in Japanese postmenopausal patients with treatment‐naive
      ER+/HER2− advanced breast cancer.

TI  - Ultrasound combined with fine needle aspiration cytology for the assessment of
      axillary lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer.
LID - e9855
AB  - This study aimed to explore the clinical usefulness of ultrasound-guided fine
      needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC) for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes 
      in patients with early stage breast cancer (BC) among the Chinese Han female
      population.Around 124 patients with early stage BC were included in this
      retrospective study. All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients with
      proven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B).
      In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5 hours prior
      to the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive
      value (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%,
      respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%,
      respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, and
      PPV between the 2 procedures (P < .05).The results of this study demonstrated
      that USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALND
      or SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.

TI  - Multiplatform plasma metabolic and lipid fingerprinting of breast cancer: A pilot
      control-case study in Colombian Hispanic women.
LID - e0190958
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease associated with metabolic
      reprogramming. The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from
      Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and
      lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint
      of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were
      combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and
      healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites
      were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid
      metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in
      metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts 
      in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could
      contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC 
      in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the
      up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of
      cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in
      breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic
      women, despite racial differences.

TI  - Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s
      disease prediction.
LID - e0192192
AB  - Wavelet Neural Networks are a combination of neural networks and wavelets and
      have been mostly used in the area of time-series prediction and control.
      Recently, Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop
      cancer prediction models. The present study proposes to use ensembles of
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks. The search for a high quality ensemble is
      directed by a fitness function that incorporates the accuracy of the classifiers 
      both independently and as part of the ensemble itself. The ensemble approach is
      tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets, one on Breast
      Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease, using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.
      Our experimental results show that, for the first dataset, the performance was
      similar to previous studies reported in literature. On the second dataset, the
      Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous 
      methods. The third dataset is relatively new and this study is the first to
      report benchmark results.

TI  - Expansion of human γδ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy using a bisphosphonate
      prodrug.
PG  - 587-99
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy with human γδ T cells expressing Vγ2Vδ2 T cell receptor
      (also termed Vγ9Vδ2) has shown promise because of their ability to recognize and 
      kill most types of tumors in a major histocombatibility complex (MHC)
      ‐unrestricted fashion that is independent of the number of tumor mutations. In
      clinical trials, adoptive transfer of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells has been shown to be safe
      and does not require preconditioning. In this report, we describe a method for
      preparing highly enriched human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells using the bisphosphonate prodrug, 
      tetrakis‐pivaloyloxymethyl 2‐(thiazole‐2‐ylamino)ethylidene‐1,1‐bisphosphonate
      (PTA). PTA stimulated the expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 cells to purities up to 99%. These 
      levels were consistently higher than those observed after expansion with
      zoledronic acid, the most commonly used stimulator for clinical trials. Cell
      numbers also averaged more than those obtained with zoledronic acid and the
      expanded Vγ2Vδ2 cells exhibited high cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The high
      purity of Vγ2Vδ2 cells expanded by PTA increased engraftment success in
      immunodeficient NOG mice. Even low levels of contaminating αβ T cells resulted in
      some mice with circulating human αβ T cells rather than Vγ2Vδ2 cells. Vγ2Vδ2
      cells from engrafted NOG mice upregulated CD25 and secreted tumor necrosis
      factor‐α and interferon‐γ in response to PTA‐treated tumor cells. Thus, PTA
      expands Vγ2Vδ2 T cells to higher purity than zoledronic acid. The high purities
      allow the successful engraftment of immunodeficient mice without further
      purification and may speed up the development of allogeneic Vγ2Vδ2 T cell
      therapies derived from HLA‐matched normal donors for patients with poor
      autologous Vγ2Vδ2 T cell responses.

TI  - Postoperative outcomes of breast reconstruction after mastectomy: A retrospective
      study.
LID - e9766
AB  - Breast reconstruction after mastectomy plays an active role in improving the
      quality-of-life (QoL) and alleviating the psychological trauma of breast cancer
      patients, and has become an indispensable part of the comprehensive treatment in 
      breast cancer. However, compared with mastectomy alone, breast reconstruction
      also increase operative complications. The surgical, oncological outcomes, and
      cosmetic effect of breast reconstruction remains to be evaluated. Data for
      patients with breast cancer who underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
      from February 2009 to November 2015 in our hospital were retrospectively
      analyzed, with a median follow-up time of 44 months. The operating time, blood
      loss, drainage fluid, postoperative complications, postoperative cosmesis,
      oncological outcomes, and QoL were evaluated and compared between different
      reconstruction types. A total of 151 women were included. The flap-based group
      had higher complication rates of marginal necrosis of incision, while the
      incidence of capsular contracture was higher in immediate implant group. There
      was no difference in blood loss, drainage fluid, and other postoperative
      complications. Several independent factors were associated with increased
      postoperative complications included diabetic, obese, and reconstruction with
      flap. There was no significant difference in the disease-free survival rate and
      overall survival rate between different surgical groups. In terms of cosmetic
      effect, patients in the tissue expander group were more likely to get a
      satisfactory postoperative breast appearance. QoL outcomes shown that the tissue 
      expander group has better body image and sexual enjoyment, while there was no
      significant difference for other QoL domains. In conclusion, different methods of
      breast reconstruction are safe and feasible for patients with breast cancer,
      tissue expander implantation following delayed implant breast reconstruction is a
      more effective treatment on cosmetic and QoL outcomes.

TI  - Availability and accessibility of subsidized mammogram screening program in
      peninsular Malaysia: A preliminary study using travel impedance approach.
LID - e0191764
AB  - Access to healthcare is essential in the pursuit of universal health coverage.
      Components of access are availability, accessibility (spatial and non-spatial),
      affordability and acceptability. Measuring spatial accessibility is common
      approach to evaluating access to health care. This study aimed to determine the
      availability and spatial accessibility of subsidised mammogram screening in
      Peninsular Malaysia. Availability was determined from the number and distribution
      of facilities. Spatial accessibility was determined using the travel impedance
      approach to represent the revealed access as opposed to potential access measured
      by other spatial measurement methods. The driving distance of return trips from
      the respondent’s residence to the facilities was determined using a mapping
      application. The travel expenditure was estimated by multiplying the total travel
      distance by a standardised travel allowance rate, plus parking fees. Respondents 
      in this study were 344 breast cancer patients who received treatment at 4
      referral hospitals between 2015 and 2016. In terms of availability, there were at
      least 6 major entities which provided subsidised mammogram programs. Facilities
      with mammogram involved with these programs were located more densely in the
      central and west coast region of the Peninsula. The ratio of mammogram facility
      to the target population of women aged 40–74 years ranged between 1: 10,000 and
      1:80,000. In terms of accessibility, of the 3.6% of the respondents had undergone
      mammogram screening, their mean travel distance was 53.4 km (SD = 34.5, range
      8–112 km) and the mean travel expenditure was RM 38.97 (SD = 24.00, range
      RM7.60–78.40). Among those who did not go for mammogram screening, the estimated 
      travel distance and expenditure had a skewed distribution with median travel
      distance of 22.0 km (IQR 12.0, 42.0, range 2.0–340.0) and the median travel cost 
      of RM 17.40 (IQR 10.40, 30.00, range 3.40–240.00). Higher travel impedance was
      noted among those who lived in sub-urban and rural areas. In summary,
      availability of mammogram facilities was good in the central and west coast of
      the peninsula. The overall provider-to-population ratio was lower than
      recommended. Based on the travel impedance approach used, accessibility to
      subsidised mammogram screening among the respondents was good in urban areas but 
      deprived in other areas. This study was a preliminary study with limitations.
      Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that actions have to be taken to improve the
      accessibility to opportunistic mammogram screening in Malaysia in pursuit of
      universal health coverage.

TI  - Adipocyte/breast cancer cell crosstalk in obesity interferes with the
      anti-proliferative efficacy of tamoxifen.
LID - e0191571
AB  - Background: Obesity is a well-known risk factor of breast cancer in
      post-menopausal women that also correlates with a diminished therapeutic
      response. The influence of adipocytes and their secretome, i.e. adipokines, on
      the efficacy of hormone therapy has yet to be elucidated. Methods: We
      investigated, ex vivo, whether mature adipocytes, differentiated from adipose
      stem cells of normal-weight (MA20) or obese (MA30) women, and their secretions,
      were able to counteract the effects of tamoxifen (Tx) which is known to decrease 
      neoplastic cell proliferation. Results: In a tridimensional model and in a model 
      of co-culture, the anti-proliferative effect of Tx on MCF-7 cancer cells was
      counteracted by MA30. These two models highlighted two different specific gene
      expression profiles for genes encoding cytokines or involved in angiogenesis
      based on the adipocyte microenvironment and the treatment. Thus it notably showed
      altered expression of genes such as TNFα that correlated with IL-6. In addition, 
      leptin, IL-6 and TNFα, at concentrations reflecting plasma concentrations in
      obese patients, decreased the anti-proliferative efficacy of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
      (a major active metabolite of Tx). Conclusions: These findings bring insights on 
      adipocytes and mammary cancer cell interactions in Tx therapy, particularly in
      overweight/obese people. Indeed, patient’ adipokine status would give valuable
      information for developing individual strategies and avoid resistance to
      treatment.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of the utility of multiparametric MRI for differentiating 
      between benign and malignant breast lesions in women in China.
LID - e9666
AB  - We explored the utility of time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic 
      trajectories dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (TWIST
      DCE-MRI), readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging- diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (RESOLVE-DWI), and echo-planar imaging- diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
      imaging (EPI-DWI) for distinguishing between malignant and benign breast
      lesions.This retrospective analysis included female patients with breast lesions 
      seen at a single center in China between January 2016 and April 2016. Patients
      were allocated to a benign or malignant group based on pathologic diagnosis. All 
      patients received routine MRI, RESOLVE-DWI, EPI-DWI, and TWIST DCE-T1WI.
      Variables measured included quantitative parameters (Ktrans, Kep, and Ve),
      semiquantitative parameters (rate of contrast enhancement for contrast agent
      inflow [W-in], rate of contrast decay for contrast agent outflow [W-out], and
      time-to-peak enhancement after contrast agent injection [TTP]) and apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for RESOLVE-DWI (ADCr) and EPI-DWI (ADCe).
      Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the
      diagnostic utility of each parameter for differentiating malignant from benign
      breast lesions.A total of 87 patients were included (benign, n = 20; malignant,
      n = 67). Compared with the benign group, the malignant group had significantly
      higher Ktrans, Kep and W-in and significantly lower W-out, TTP, ADCe, and ADCr
      (all P < .05); Ve was not significantly different between groups. RESOLVE-DWI was
      superior to conventional EPI-DWI at illustrating lesion boundary and morphology, 
      while ADCr was significantly lower than ADCe in all patients. Kep, W-out, ADCr,
      and ADCe showed the highest diagnostic efficiency (based on AUC value) for
      differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Combining 3 parameters
      (Kep, W-out, and ADCr) had a higher diagnostic efficiency (AUC, 0.965) than any
      individual parameter and distinguished between benign and malignant lesions with 
      high sensitivity (91.0%), specificity (95.0%), and accuracy (91.9%).An index
      combining Kep, W-out, and ADCr could potentially be used for the differential
      diagnosis of breast lesions.

AB  - In silico methods of phenotypic screening are necessary to reduce the time and
      cost of the experimental in vivo screening of anticancer agents through dozens of
      millions of natural and synthetic chemical compounds. We used the previously
      developed PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) algorithm to
      create and validate the classification SAR models for predicting the cytotoxicity
      of chemicals against different types of human cell lines using ChEMBL
      experimental data. A training set from 59,882 structures of compounds was created
      based on the experimental data (IG50, IC50, and % inhibition values) from ChEMBL.
      The average accuracy of prediction (AUC) calculated by leave-one-out and a
      20-fold cross-validation procedure during the training was 0.930 and 0.927 for
      278 cancer cell lines, respectively, and 0.948 and 0.947 for cytotoxicity
      prediction for 27 normal cell lines, respectively. Using the given SAR models, we
      developed a freely available web-service for cell-line cytotoxicity profile
      prediction (CLC-Pred: Cell-Line Cytotoxicity Predictor) based on the following
      structural formula: http://way2drug.com/Cell-line/.

TI  - Evaluation of drug mechanism and efficacy of a novel anti-angiogenic agent,
      TTAC-0001, using multi-modality bioimaging in a mouse breast cancer orthotopic
      model.
LID - e0187063
AB  - Purpose: Targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) has
      potential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling
      regulator of VEGF/VEGFR pathways. We aimed to elucidate the drug mechanism and
      anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-0001, a novel, fully human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR
      monoclonal antibody, in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-modal
      bioimaging. Materials and methods: We used orthotopic xenograft tumor model in
      which human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected into the right mammary
      fat pad of Balb/c nude mice. We investigated its biodistribution using serial
      fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action
      using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was
      assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic
      analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with 
      anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four
      groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2
      group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group). Results: The TTAC-10 group showed
      good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good
      anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive 
      cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10
      group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as
      detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also
      showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index 
      in histopathologic analyses. Conclusion: We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001
      effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic
      breast cancer model. It may provide a future treatment option for breast cancer.

TI  - The correlation of background parenchymal enhancement in the contralateral breast
      with patient and tumor characteristics of MRI-screen detected breast cancers.
LID - e0191399
AB  - Purpose: Higher background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) could be used for
      stratification of MRI screening programs since it might be related to a higher
      breast cancer risk. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to correlate BPE to
      patient and tumor characteristics in women with unilateral MRI-screen detected
      breast cancer who participated in an intermediate and high risk screening
      program. As BPE in the affected breast may be difficult to discern from enhancing
      cancer, we assumed that BPE in the contralateral breast is a representative
      measure for BPE in women with unilateral breast cancer. Materials and methods:
      This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional board and a
      waiver for consent was granted. MR-examinations of women with unilateral breast
      cancers screen-detected on breast MRI were evaluated by two readers. BPE in the
      contralateral breast was rated according to BI-RADS. Univariate analyses were
      performed to study associations. Observer variability was computed. Results:
      Analysis included 77 breast cancers in 76 patients (age: 48±9.8 years), including
      62 invasive and 15 pure ductal carcinoma in-situ cases. A negative association
      between BPE and tumor grade (p≤0.016) and a positive association with
      progesterone status (p≤0.021) was found. The correlation was stronger when only
      considering invasive disease. Inter-reader agreement was substantial. Conclusion:
      Lower BPE in the contralateral breast in women with unilateral breast cancer
      might be associated to higher tumor grade and progesterone receptor negativity.
      Great care should be taken using BPE for stratification of patients to tailored
      screening programs.

TI  - Menstrual and reproductive factors and risk of breast cancer: A case-control
      study in the Fez region, Morocco.
LID - e0191333
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. In the
      Moroccan context, the role of well-known reproductive factors in breast cancer
      remains poorly documented. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship 
      between menstrual and reproductive factors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan
      women in the Fez region. Methods: A case–control study was conducted at the
      Hassan II University Hospital of Fez between January 2014 and April 2015. A total
      of 237 cases of breast cancer and 237 age-matched controls were included.
      Information on sociodemographic characteristics, menstrual and reproductive
      history, family history of breast cancer, and lifestyle factors was obtained
      through a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were
      used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer by
      menstrual and reproductive factors adjusted for potential confounders. Results:
      Early menarche (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.38) and nulliparity (OR = 3.77, 95% CI:
      1.98–7.30) were significantly related to an increased risk of breast cancer,
      whereas an early age at first full-term pregnancy was associated with a decreased
      risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.65). Conclusion: The results of 
      this study confirm the role of established reproductive factors for breast cancer
      in Moroccan women. It identified some susceptible groups at high risk of breast
      cancer. Preventive interventions and screening should focus on these groups as a 
      priority. These results should be confirmed in a larger, multicenter study.

TI  - High nuclear MSK1 is associated with longer survival in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 509-17
AB  - Purpose: Mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSKs) are important substrates of
      the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase family. MSK1
      and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases, with MSK1 being
      suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation, cell
      cycle progression, cell migration, invasion and tumour growth. The aim of the
      current study was to assess MSK1 protein expression in breast cancer tumour
      specimens, evaluating its prognostic significance. Methods: A large cohort of
      1902 early stage invasive breast cancer patients was used to explore the
      expression of MSK1. Protein expression was examined using standard
      immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Results: Low MSK1 protein expression 
      was associated with younger age (P = 0.004), higher tumour grade (P < 0.001),
      higher Nottingham Prognostic Index scores (P = 0.007), negative ER (P < 0.001)
      and PR (P < 0.001) status, and with triple-negative (P < 0.001) and basal-like
      (P < 0.001) phenotypes. Low MSK1 protein expression was significantly associated 
      with shorter time to distant metastasis (P < 0.001), and recurrence (P = 0.013)
      and early death due to breast cancer (P = 0.01). This association between high
      MSK1 expression and improved breast cancer-specific survival was observed in the 
      whole cohort (P = 0.009) and in the HER2-negative and non-basal like tumours
      (P = 0.006 and P = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis including other
      prognostic variables indicated that MSK1 is not an independent marker of outcome.
      Conclusions: High MSK1 is associated with improved breast cancer-specific
      survival in early stage invasive breast cancer patients, and has additional
      prognostic value in HER2-negative and non-basal like disease. Although not an
      independent marker of outcome, we believe such findings and significant
      associations with well-established negative prognostic factors (age, grade,
      Nottingham Prognostic Index, hormone receptor status, time to distant metastasis,
      recurrence and triple-negative/basal-like status) warrant further examination and
      validation in independent patient cohorts.

TI  - Differential microRNA expression in breast cancer with different onset age.
LID - e0191195
AB  - Purpose: The lower breast cancer incidence in Asian populations compared with
      Western populations has been speculated to be caused by environmental and genetic
      variation. Early-onset breast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast
      cancers in Asian populations, but the reason for this is unclear. We aimed to
      examine miRNA expression profiles in different age-onset groups and pathological 
      subtypes in Asian breast cancer. Methods: At the first stage, 10 samples (tumor: 
      n = 6, normal tissue: n = 4) were analyzed with an Agilent microRNA 470 probe
      microarray. Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that were significantly
      altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review were
      further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of 145 breast cancer
      samples at the second stage of the process. Correlations between
      clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients from different age
      groups and candidate miRNA expression were elucidated. Results: In the present
      study, the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group, and an 
      onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates. For all
      breast cancer patients, miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated, and miR-21,
      miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-141 were up-regulated. In very young patients (age < 
      35 y/o), the expression of 3 and 8 specific miRNAs were up- and down-regulated,
      respectively. In young patients (36–40 y/o), 3 and 3 specific miRNAs were up- and
      down-regulated, respectively. miR-532-5p was up-regulated in triple-negative
      breast cancer. Conclusions: Differential miRNA expressions between normal and
      tumor tissues were observed in different age groups and tumor subtypes.
      Evolutionarily conserved miRNA clusters, which initiate malignancy
      transformation, were up-regulated in the breast cancers of very young patients.
      None of the significantly altered miRNAs were observed in postmenopausal
      patients.

AB  - The prevalence of cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has
      demonstrated prognostic value in multiple tumor types. In particular, CD8 counts 
      (in combination with CD3 and CD45RO) have been shown to be superior to
      traditional UICC staging in colon cancer patients and higher total CD8 counts
      have been associated with better survival in breast cancer patients. However,
      immune infiltrate heterogeneity can lead to potentially significant
      misrepresentations of marker prevalence in routine histologic sections. We
      examined step sections of breast and colorectal cancer samples for CD8+ T cell
      prevalence by standard chromogenic immunohistochemistry to determine marker
      variability and inform practice of T cell biomarker assessment in formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Stained sections were digitally imaged
      and CD8+ lymphocytes within defined regions of interest (ROI) including the tumor
      and surrounding stroma were enumerated. Statistical analyses of CD8+ cell count
      variability using a linear model/ANOVA framework between patients as well as
      between levels within a patient sample were performed. Our results show that CD8+
      T-cell distribution is highly homogeneous within a standard tissue sample in both
      colorectal and breast carcinomas. As such, cytotoxic T cell prevalence by
      immunohistochemistry on a single level or even from a subsample of biopsy
      fragments taken from that level can be considered representative of cytotoxic T
      cell infiltration for the entire tumor section within the block. These findings
      support the technical validity of biomarker strategies relying on CD8
      immunohistochemistry.

LID - e0190348
AB  - The objectives of the study were to develop a framework for automatic outer and
      inner breast tissue segmentation using multi-parametric MRI images of the breast 
      tumor patients; and to perform breast density and tumor tissue analysis. MRI of
      the breast was performed on 30 patients at 3T-MRI. T1, T2 and PD-weighted(W)
      images, with and without fat saturation(WWFS), and
      dynamic-contrast-enhanced(DCE)-MRI data were acquired. The proposed automatic
      segmentation approach was performed in two steps. In step-1, outer segmentation
      of breast tissue from rest of body parts was performed on structural images
      (T2-W/T1-W/PD-W without fat saturation images) using automatic landmarks
      detection technique based on operations like profile screening, Otsu
      thresholding, morphological operations and empirical observation. In step-2,
      inner segmentation of breast tissue into fibro-glandular(FG), fatty and tumor
      tissue was performed. For validation of breast tissue segmentation, manual
      segmentation was carried out by two radiologists and similarity coefficients(Dice
      and Jaccard) were computed for outer as well as inner tissues. FG density and
      tumor volume were also computed and analyzed. The proposed outer and inner
      segmentation approach worked well for all the subjects and was validated by two
      radiologists. The average Dice and Jaccard coefficients value for outer
      segmentation using T2-W images, obtained by two radiologists, were 0.977 and
      0.951 respectively. These coefficient values for FG tissue were 0.915 and 0.875
      respectively whereas for tumor tissue, values were 0.968 and 0.95 respectively.
      The volume of segmented tumor ranged over 2.1 cm3–7.08 cm3. The proposed approach
      provided automatic outer and inner breast tissue segmentation, which enables
      automatic calculations of breast tissue density and tumor volume. This is a
      complete framework for outer and inner breast segmentation method for all
      structural images.

TI  - Nanoparticle elasticity directs tumor uptake.
LID - 130
AB  - To date, the role of elasticity in drug delivery remains elusive due to the
      inability to measure microscale mechanics and alter rheology without affecting
      chemistry. Herein, we describe the in vitro cellular uptake and in vivo tumor
      uptake of nanolipogels (NLGs). NLGs are composed of identical lipid bilayers
      encapsulating an alginate core, with tunable elasticity. The elasticity of NLGs
      was evaluated by atomic force microscopy, which demonstrated that they exhibit
      Young’s moduli ranging from 45 ± 9 to 19,000 ± 5 kPa. Neoplastic and
      non-neoplastic cells exhibited significantly greater uptake of soft NLGs (Young’s
      modulus <1.6 MPa) relative to their elastic counterparts (Young’s modulus
      >13.8 MPa). In an orthotopic breast tumor model, soft NLGs accumulated
      significantly more in tumors, whereas elastic NLGs preferentially accumulated in 
      the liver. Our findings demonstrate that particle elasticity directs tumor
      accumulation, suggesting that it may be a design parameter to enhance tumor
      delivery efficiency.

TI  - Long term effects of manual lymphatic drainage and active exercises on physical
      morbidities, lymphoscintigraphy parameters and lymphedema formation in patients
      operated due to breast cancer: A clinical trial.
LID - e0189176
AB  - Purpose: evaluate whether manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) or active exercise (AE)
      is associated with shoulder range of motion (ROM), wound complication and changes
      in the lymphatic parameters after breast cancer (BC) surgery and whether these
      parameters have an association with lymphedema formation in the long run.
      Methods: Clinical trial with 106 women undergoing radical BC surgery, in the
      Women’s Integrated Healthcare Center—University of Campinas. Women were matched
      for staging, age and body mass index and were allocated to performed AE or MLD, 2
      weekly sessions during one month after surgery. The wound was evaluated 2 months 
      after surgery. ROM, upper limb circumference measurement and upper limb
      lymphoscintigraphy were performed before surgery, and 2 and 30 months after
      surgery. Results: The incidence of seroma, dehiscence and infection did not
      differ between groups. Both groups showed ROM deficit of flexion and abduction in
      the second month postoperative and partial recovery after 30 months. Cumulative
      incidence of lymphedema was 23.8% and did not differ between groups (p = 0.29).
      Concerning the lymphoscintigraphy parameters, there was a significant convergent 
      trend between baseline degree uptake (p = 0.003) and velocity visualization of
      axillary lymph nodes (p = 0.001) with lymphedema formation. A reduced marker
      uptake before or after surgery predicted lymphedema formation in the long run (>2
      years). None of the lymphoscintigraphy parameters were shown to be associated
      with the study group. Age ≤39 years was the factor with the greatest association 
      with lymphedema (p = 0.009). In women with age ≤39 years, BMI >24Kg/m2 was
      significantly associated with lymphedema (p = 0.017). In women over 39 years old,
      women treated with MLD were at a significantly higher risk of developing
      lymphedema (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Lymphatic abnormalities precede lymphedema
      formation in BC patients. In younger women, obesity seems to be the major player 
      in lymphedema development and, in older women, improving muscle strength through 
      AE can prevent lymphedema. In essence, MLD is as safe and effective as AE in
      rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery.

TI  - The use of automated Ki67 analysis to predict Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence
      categories in early-stage breast cancer.
LID - e0188983
AB  - Ki67 is a commonly used marker of cancer cell proliferation, and has significant 
      prognostic value in breast cancer. In spite of its clinical importance,
      assessment of Ki67 remains a challenge, as current manual scoring methods have
      high inter- and intra-user variability. A major reason for this variability is
      selection bias, in that different observers will score different regions of the
      same tumor. Here, we developed an automated Ki67 scoring method that eliminates
      selection bias, by using whole-slide analysis to identify and score the tumor
      regions with the highest proliferative rates. The Ki67 indices calculated using
      this method were highly concordant with manual scoring by a pathologist
      (Pearson’s r = 0.909) and between users (Pearson’s r = 0.984). We assessed the
      clinical validity of this method by scoring Ki67 from 328 whole-slide sections of
      resected early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-negative breast cancer. All patients had Oncotype DX testing performed
      (Genomic Health) and available Recurrence Scores. High Ki67 indices correlated
      significantly with several clinico-pathological correlates, including higher
      tumor grade (1 versus 3, P<0.001), higher mitotic score (1 versus 3, P<0.001),
      and lower Allred scores for estrogen and progesterone receptors (P = 0.002,
      0.008). High Ki67 indices were also significantly correlated with higher Oncotype
      DX risk-of-recurrence group (low versus high, P<0.001). Ki67 index was the major 
      contributor to a machine learning model which, when trained solely on
      clinico-pathological data and Ki67 scores, identified Oncotype DX high- and
      low-risk patients with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity and 80% specificity.
      Automated scoring of Ki67 can thus successfully address issues of consistency,
      reproducibility and accuracy, in a manner that integrates readily into the
      workflow of a pathology laboratory. Furthermore, automated Ki67 scores contribute
      significantly to models that predict risk of recurrence in breast cancer.

TI  - Breast cancer: The translation of big genomic data to cancer precision medicine.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of
      genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to cancer
      and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. For the
      past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from
      single‐gene to whole‐genome screening by using genome‐wide association study and 
      next‐generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International
      collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify
      clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings.
      Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of
      genomic alterations with high‐throughput screening as well as the use of genomic 
      information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which
      further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and
      monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing 
      data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine
      learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative “−omics” data to
      refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future.

TI  - Oestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in older
      women—Biological characteristics and long-term clinical outcome.
LID - e0188528
AB  - Background: Older women are at the greatest risk of breast cancer development and
      a considerable number present with comorbidities. Although the majority of breast
      cancers in this age group express oestrogen receptor (ER), which makes endocrine 
      therapy (primary or adjuvant) feasible, given the huge size of the elderly
      population, there remains a significant number of patients, in absolute term,
      whose tumours do not express ER and their management is challenging. Methods: Of 
      a consecutive series of 1,758 older (≥70 years) women with early operable primary
      breast cancer managed in a dedicated service from 1973–2010, 252(14.3%) had
      ER-negative (histochemical (H) score ≤50) tumours. Their clinical outcome was
      retrospectively reviewed and tumour samples collected from diagnostic core
      biopsies were analysed for progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki67 using
      immunohistochemistry. Results: The commonest primary treatment was surgery (N =
      194, 77%) followed by primary endocrine therapy (14.3%), primary radiotherapy
      (5.6%) and supportive treatment only (3.1%). Among the patients undergoing
      surgery, most of them had grade 3 (78.1%) and node-negative disease (62.2%). Some
      of them (21.1%) received postoperative radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of
      37.5 months, 117 patients had died, out of which 48.6% were due to breast cancer.
      For those who underwent surgery, the regional and local recurrence rates were 2% 
      and 1.1% per annum respectively. For those who received primary endocrine
      therapy, 38% progressed at 6 months, however all patients who had primary
      radiotherapy achieved clinical benefit at 6 months. Regardless of treatment
      given, the 5-year breast cancer specific and overall survival rates were 70% and 
      50% respectively. Biological analysis based on good quality needle core biopsy
      specimensfrom181 patients showed that 26.8% (N = 49), 16.9% (N = 31) and 70.7% (N
      = 70)expressed positivity for PgR, HER2 and Ki67 respectively. No correlation
      between these biomarkers and breast cancer specific survival was demonstrated.
      Conclusion: Oestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in
      older women is associated with poor prognostic features in terms of biology and
      clinical outcome. Surgery appears to produce the best outcome as a primary
      treatment, however for those where neither surgery nor chemotherapy is
      appropriate, primary radiotherapy can be beneficial.

TI  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the breast: Four case reports and review of the
      literature.
LID - e9385
AB  - Rationale:: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the breast is a rare entity
      comprising specific morphological and immunohistochemical features, and has been 
      previously only reported in 33 cases. Patient concerns:: Four cases of MEC of the
      breast are reported in this study. All patients were women with ages ranging from
      39 to 66 years. The lesions consisted of neoplastic solid nests and cystic spaces
      sometimes filled with mucoid material. Diagnoses:: At high power, the tumors were
      composed of various proportions of basaloid, intermediate, epidermoid, and
      mucinous cells in different cases. All cases were classified as low-grade MEC of 
      the breast. Tumor cells exhibited low levels of hormonal receptor expression in
      two cases (cases 1 and 3), and immunonegativity in one case (case 2). On the
      contrary, estrogen receptors (ER) were positively expressed in 60% of tumor cells
      in case 4. Tumor cells did not express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER-2)/neu protein in all the cases. Interventions:: Modified radical mastectomy
      (Auchincloss) was performed in the first two cases, while the remaining two
      patients underwent mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy. Outcomes:: All
      patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrent disease after a period
      ranging from 4 months to 156 months. Lessons:: MEC of the breast is a rare
      primary carcinoma that is difficult to diagnose. Multiple tissue blocks are
      necessary before obtaining all cell types. Special stains for mucin and electron 
      microscopy would be helpful in suspected cases. Hormonal factors might have an
      impact on the biological behavior of tumors, but further studies are needed to
      draw conclusions.

TI  - Breast metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: a case report.
LID - 355
AB  - Background: Breast metastases from extramammary tumors are extremely rare, the
      most common primary tumors being contralateral breast carcinoma, followed by
      lung, gynecological, gastrointestinal, melanoma, and hematological cancers. Only 
      a few cases deriving from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been
      reported in the literature to date. Case presentation: We report a case of a
      47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary breast 
      lesion in the right upper external quadrant associated with multiple bone and
      visceral metastases. Two years before, she had undergone radical resection of a
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), which was followed by
      adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4
      cm in the right upper external quadrant that was associated with multiple
      axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies. A positron emission tomographic
      scan documented multiple visceral and bone metastases with a single
      hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast. The results of histology and
      immunohistochemistry were consistent with a metastasis from a squamous cell
      carcinoma. The patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency 1 month after her 
      breast metastasis diagnosis and before starting any systemic antitumoral
      treatment. Conclusions: Although breast metastases are extremely rare, they
      should be considered in any patient with a history of cancer and confirmed by
      histology and immunohistochemistry because they are very difficult to distinguish
      from other primary breast tumors based only on clinical and radiological
      features. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for breast metastasis
      management. Surgery and radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation, but
      they do not have any relevant impact on survival, the prognosis being poor, with 
      an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes of surgeon-performed intraoperative ultrasonography-guided
      wire localization and preoperative wire localization in nonpalpable breast cancer
      patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery: A retrospective cohort study.
LID - e9340
AB  - This study aimed to determine the efficacy of intraoperative
      ultrasonography-guided wire localization guided breast-conserving surgery (BCS)
      for nonpalpable breast cancer and compare it to conventional preoperative wire
      localization (PWL) guided surgery.We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts 
      of 214 consecutive nonpalpable breast cancer patients who underwent BCS using
      intraoperative ultrasonography-guided wire localization by a surgeon (IUWLS) and 
      PWL, between April 2013 and March 2017. Positive surgical margins, reexcision
      rates, and resection volumes were investigated.Of the total cohort, 124 patients 
      underwent BCS with IUWLS and 90 patients with PWL. The following did not differ
      between the IUWLS and PWL groups: positive margin status, re-excision rate,
      conversion rate, permanent positive margin status, reoperation rate, median
      optimal resection volume (ORV), median total resection volume (TRV), and median
      closest tumor-free margin. Rather, median (range) widest tumor-free margin was
      significantly smaller in the IUWLS group (9 mm [5–12]) than in the PWL group
      (14 mm [9–20]; P = .003]). Median (range) calculated resection ratio (CRR) was
      significantly lower in the IUWLS group (1.67 [0.87–9.38]) than in the PWL group
      (4.83 [1.63–21.04]; P = .02).In nonpalpable breast cancer patients undergoing
      BCS, IUWLS showed positive resection margins and reexcision rates equivalent to
      those of the conventional PWL method. Additionally, excision volume and widest
      tumor-free margin were smaller with IUWLS, confirming that healthy breast tissue 
      is less likely to be resected with this method. Our results suggest that IUWLS
      offers an excellent alternative to PWL, while avoiding PWL-induced patient
      discomfort.

TI  - Comparison of rigid and deformable registration through the respiratory phases of
      four-dimensional computed tomography image data sets for radiotherapy after
      breast-conserving surgery.
LID - e9143
AB  - Background:: The aim of this study was to compare the geometric differences in
      gross tumor volume (GTV) and surgical clips propagated by rigid image
      registration (RIR) and deformable image registration (DIR) using a
      four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) image data set for patients treated
      with boost irradiation or accelerated partial breast irradiation after
      breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Methods:: The 4DCT data sets of 44 patients who 
      had undergone BCS were acquired. GTV and selected clips were manually delineated 
      on end-inhalation phase (CT0) and end-exhalation phase (CT50) images of 4DCT data
      sets. Subsequently, the GTV and selected clips from CT0 images were transformed
      and propagated to CT50 images using RIR and DIR, respectively. The geometric
      differences in GTV and surgical clips from DIR were compared with those of RIR.
      Results:: The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) index was 0.860 ± 0.042 for 
      RIR and 0.870 ± 0.040 for DIR for GTV (P = .000). The three-dimensional distance 
      to the center of mass (COM) of the GTV from RIR was longer than that from DIR
      (1.22 mm and 1.10 mm, respectively, P = .000). Moreover, in the
      anterior–posterior direction, displacements from RIR were significantly greater
      than those from DIR for both GTV (0.70 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively) and selected
      clips (upper clip, 0.45 mm vs 0.20 mm; inner clip, 0.55 mm vs 0.30 mm; outer
      clip, 0.40 mm vs 0.20 mm; lower clip, 0.50 mm vs 0.25 mm) (P = .000). However, in
      the left–right and superior–inferior directions, there were no significant
      displacement differences between RIR and DIR for GTV and the selected clips (all 
      P > .050). Conclusion:: DIR can improve the overlap for GTV registration from CT0
      to CT50 images from 4DCT scanning. Furthermore, DIR is superior to RIR in
      reflecting the displacement of GTV and selected clips in the anterior–posterior
      direction induced by respiratory movement.

TI  - Prognostic utility of FDG PET/CT and bone scintigraphy in breast cancer patients 
      with bone-only metastasis.
LID - e8985
AB  - We performed this retrospective clinical study to examine the prognostic power of
      bone scintigraphy (BS) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in terms of overall survival (OS) of 
      breast cancer with bone-only metastasis.We retrospectively evaluated 100 female
      invasive ductal breast cancer patients (mean age 48.1 years) with bone-only
      metastasis. Twenty-five patients had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive tumors, 65 were estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone
      receptor (PR)-positive, HER2-negative tumors, and 10 were triple negative tumors.
      The patients were treated properly with various treatments, including
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone, and bisphosphonate therapy, based on their
      clinical status. All patients underwent BS and FDG PET/CT at baseline and 1 year 
      after treatment. The baseline and follow images were visually compared, and the
      patients were grouped as responders or nonresponders based on their images. OS
      was compared between the groups.The mean OS after the diagnosis of bone-only
      metastasis was 57.6 months. Fifty-one patients (51%) died within 5 years after
      diagnosis of metastasis. No difference in survival was evident between responders
      and nonresponders based on BS imaging data (P = .090). The response status based 
      on PET imaging data waste only significant independent prognostic factor on
      multivariate analysis (P = .001). Survival was lower in nonresponders than in
      responders based on PET imaging (32.7% vs 66.4%; P < .001).Our findings suggest
      that the response status according to FDG PET imaging can be used to predict OS
      in breast cancer patients with bone-only metastasis.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of contrast agent uptake in standard fat‐suppressed
      dynamic contrast‐enhanced MRI examinations of the breast.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Purpose: To propose a method to quantify T1 and contrast agent uptake in breast
      dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) examinations undertaken with standard clinical
      fat‐suppressed MRI sequences and to demonstrate the proposed approach by
      comparing the enhancement characteristics of lobular and ductal carcinomas.
      Methods: A standard fat‐suppressed DCE of the breast was performed at 1.5 T
      (Siemens Aera), followed by the acquisition of a proton density (PD)‐weighted
      sequence, also fat suppressed. Both sequences were characterized with test
      objects (T1 ranging from 30 ms to 2,400 ms) and calibration curves were obtained 
      to enable T1 calculation. The reproducibility and accuracy of the calibration
      curves were also investigated. Healthy volunteers and patients were scanned with 
      Ethics Committee approval. The effect of B0 field inhomogeneity was assessed in
      test objects and healthy volunteers. The T1 of breast tumors was calculated at
      different time points (pre‐, peak‐, and post‐contrast agent administration) for
      20 patients, pre‐treatment (10 lobular and 10 ductal carcinomas) and the two
      cancer types were compared (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test). Results: The calibration
      curves proved to be highly reproducible (coefficient of variation under 10%). T1 
      measurements were affected by B0 field inhomogeneity, but frequency shifts below 
      50 Hz introduced only 3% change to fat‐suppressed T1 measurements of breast
      parenchyma in volunteers. The values of T1 measured pre‐, peak‐, and
      post‐contrast agent administration demonstrated that the dynamic range of the DCE
      sequence was correct, that is, image intensity is approximately directly
      proportional to 1/T1 for that range. Significant differences were identified in
      the width of the distributions of the post‐contrast T1 values between lobular and
      ductal carcinomas (P < 0.05); lobular carcinomas demonstrated a wider range of
      post‐contrast T1 values, potentially related to their infiltrative growth
      pattern. Conclusions: This work has demonstrated the feasibility of
      fat‐suppressed T1 measurements as a tool for clinical studies. The proposed
      quantitative approach is practical, enabled the detection of differences between 
      lobular and invasive ductal carcinomas, and further enables the optimization of
      DCE protocols by tailoring the dynamic range of the sequence to the values of T1 
      measured.

TI  - Correlation study between osteoporosis and hematopoiesis in the context of
      adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.
PG  - 309-17
AB  - This retrospective study attempts to establish if a correlation exists between
      osteoporosis and hematopoiesis before and after adjuvant chemotherapy in the
      context of non-metastatic breast cancer. Osteoporosis is interpreted both as a
      direct marker of osteoblastic decline and as an indirect marker of increased bone
      marrow adiposity within the hematopoietic microenvironment. Patients from the
      “Centre du Sein” at CHUV (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois) undergoing
      adjuvant chemotherapy were included in this study. Evolution of blood counts was 
      studied in correlation with the osteoporosis status. Toxicity of chemotherapy was
      coded according to published probability of febrile neutropenia. One hundred
      forty-three women were included: mean age 52.1 ± 12.5 years, mean BMI (body mass 
      index) 24.4 ± 4.1. BMD (bone mineral density) scored osteoporotic in 32% and
      osteopenic in 45%. Prior to chemotherapy, BMD was positively correlated with
      neutrophil (p < 0.001) and thrombocyte (p = 0.01) count; TBS (trabecular bone
      score) was not correlated with blood count. After the first cycle of
      chemotherapy, an increase of one point in TBS correlated with a decrease of 57%
      on the time to reach leucocyte nadir (p = 0.004). There was a positive
      correlation between BMD and risk of infection (p < 0.001). Our data demonstrates 
      an association between osteoporosis and lower blood counts in a younger cohort
      than previously published, extending it for the first time to neutrophil counts
      in females. Our results suggest that the healthier the bone, the earlier the
      lowest leucocyte count value, prompting further research on this area.

TI  - Predictive value of BRCA1/2 mRNA expression for response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in BRCA‐negative breast cancers.
PG  - 166-73
AB  - It is well known that BRCA1 and BRCA2 play a central role in DNA repair, but the 
      relationship between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression and response to neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy in sporadic breast cancer patients has not been well established.
      Here, we investigate the association between BRCA1 or BRCA2 mRNA expression
      levels and pathological response in 674 BRCA1/2 mutation‐negative breast cancer
      patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression
      were assessed using quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction in core
      biopsy breast cancer tissue obtained prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. A total 129 patients (19.1%) achieved pathological complete
      response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among patients treated with
      anthracycline‐based chemotherapy (n = 531), BRCA1 mRNA low expression patients
      had a significantly higher pCR rate than intermediate or high BRCA1 mRNA
      expression groups (24.6% vs 16.8% or 14.0%, P = .031) and retained borderline
      significance (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 0.93‐2.56, P = .094) in multivariate analysis. 
      Among the 129 patients who received a taxane‐based regimen, pCR rate showed no
      differences in BRCA1 low, intermediate, and high mRNA level subgroups (19.6%,
      26.8% and 21.4%, respectively; P = .71). BRCA2 mRNA level was not associated with
      pCR rate in the anthracyline‐based treated subgroup (P = .60) or the taxane‐based
      regimen subgroup (P = .82). Taken together, our findings suggested that BRCA1
      mRNA expression could be used as a predictive marker in BRCA1/2 mutation‐negative
      breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant anthracycline‐based treatment.

TI  - Preferential expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 in male breast cancer.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Background: Male breast cancer is an uncommon disease often discovered in
      advanced stage; thus, in the setting of metastatic adenocarcinoma, breast origin 
      must be taken to account. Breast markers as NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and
      BRST-2 are established tools for labelling primary and metastatic female breast
      cancer; however, none of them has been sufficiently studied in male breast
      cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of these markers in
      male breast cancer. Materials and methods: Thirty consecutive cases of male
      breast cancer and eight loco-regional metastases were re-revaluated, assembled in
      tissue micro array (TMA), and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for
      NY-BR-1, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and BRST-2. The IHC stains were scored either
      positive or negative. In addition, concordant expression patterns of primary
      tumors and matched metastasis were noted. Results: 30 of 30 (100%) primary tumors
      and 8 of 8 (100%) metastases were positive for NY-BR-1. 30 of 30 (100%) primary
      tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for GATA-3. 22 of 30 (73.3%)
      primary tumors and 6 of 8 (75%) metastases were positive for Mammaglobin. 18 of
      30 (60%) primary tumors and 5 of 8 (62.5%) metastases were positive for BRST-2.
      Differences in staining percentage were not significant with Fisher’s exact test.
      Conclusion: We found a high sensitivity for all the markers analyzed. Moreover,
      the expression of NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male
      breast cancer in primary and metastatic setting.

AB  - Breast tuberculosis is rare. It poses a problem of differential diagnosis because
      it may be mistaken for breast cancer as clinical examination and diagnostic
      imaging are not specific. Breast tuberculosis should be suspected especially in

      menopausal woman with breast tuberculosis in order to raise concern for
      diagnosis.

TI  - Application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in occult breast cancer: Five case
      reports.
LID - e8200
AB  - Rationale:: Although rare, occult breast cancer (OBC) originates from breast
      tissue. Its primary lesions cannot be identified by clinical examination or
      imaging; therefore, the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis remain controversial.
      Patient concerns:: This study comprised 5 female OBC patients who were admitted
      to the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University for painless axillary
      lumps. Diagnoses:: 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) indicated metastasis in the ipsilateral
      axillary lymph nodes. No clear breast primary lesions were identified; other
      organs were also excluded as the primary site. Pathological biopsy confirmed
      axillary lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of
      the tumor to identify the source revealed that estrogen receptors (ERs) and
      progesterone receptors (PgRs) were positive in 2 cases, ER was positive and PR
      was negative in 1 case, and both were negative in 2 cases. Human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 was negative in all cases. All patients were diagnosed with
      OBC. Interventions:: All patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). One
      patient did not undergo follow-up therapy. The other 4 underwent total mastectomy
      plus axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy. Two patients also
      underwent endocrine therapy. Outcomes:: Patients were followed up for 9.0 to 72.0
      months. Four achieved pathological complete response. One patient experienced
      metastasis to the ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes 2.0 years later, which 
      was cleared after additional treatment. The other patients were tumor free.
      Lessons:: Here, we are reporting 5 cases of OBC treated with NAC that were
      evaluated by 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. This study suggests that NAC might lead to a
      positive outcome.

AB  - We report the case of Ms. A.A, a primiparous woman aged 21 years presenting (4
      months after delivery) with an increase in left breast volume occurred 1 week
      after delivery associated with fever. The patient was put on amoxicillin,
      protected by suspending breast-feeding for several weeks without improvement.
      Clinical examination showed febrile patient with a temperature of 39°, an
      increase in left breast volume, inflammatory signs especially at the level of
      internal quadrants (A). Palpation showed a painful, hot collection adherent to
      the skin, measuring 16 cm, at the level of the internal quadrants, invading the
      external quadrants, without axillary adenopathies, suggesting breast abscess.
      Ultrasound (B) showed voluminous solidocystic predominantly liquid echogenic mass
      with thick walls and buds up to 46 mm, classified as ACR4. Puncture biopsy
      collected grayish green liquid, sent for bacteriological examination; antibiotic 
      therapy with quinolones was started. Follow up of patient, after 3 days, showed
      reduction of the inflammatory signs and bacteriological examination of the liquid
      found no germ. After 15 days of antibiotic therapy, the inflammatory signs had
      disappeared and the volume of the mass had reduced enough, hence the indication
      for cystectomy. Cystectomy with simple enucleation was performed (C);
      surprisingly, the histological examination showed cystic fibroadenoma (D).

      patients in southern Iran using Cox and empirical Bayesian additive hazard
      models.
LID - e2017043
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A survival analysis of breast cancer patients in southern Iran
      according to age has yet to be conducted. This study aimed to quantify the
      factors contributing to a poor prognosis, using Cox and empirical Bayesian
      additive hazard (EBAH) models, among young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-64
      years), and elderly (≥ 65 years) women. METHODS: Data from 1,574 breast cancer
      patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2012 in the cancer registry of Fars Province
      (southern Iran) were stratified into 3 age groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was
      used to estimate the overall survival rates. Cox and EBAH models were applied to 
      each age category, and the Akaike information criterion was used to assess the
      goodness-of-fit of the 2 hazard models. RESULTS: As of December 2012, 212 women
      (13.5%) in our study population had died, of whom 43 were young (15.3%), 134
      middle-aged (11.8%), and 35 elderly (22.3%). The 5-year survival probability by
      age category was 0.83 (standard error [SE], 0.03), 0.88 (SE, 0.01), and 0.75 (SE,
      0.04), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Nottingham Prognostic Index was the most
      effective prognostic factor. The model based on Bayesian methodology performed
      better with various sample sizes than the Cox model, which is the most widely
      used method of survival analysis.

TI  - Authentication of M14 melanoma cell line proves misidentification of MDA‐MB‐435
      breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 561-72
AB  - A variety of analytical approaches have indicated that melanoma cell line
      UCLA‐SO‐M14 (M14) and breast carcinoma cell line MDA‐MB‐435 originate from a
      common donor. This indicates that at some point in the past, one of these cell
      lines became misidentified, meaning that it ceased to correspond to the reported 
      donor and instead became falsely identified (through cross‐contamination or other
      means) as a cell line from a different donor. Initial studies concluded that
      MDA‐MB‐435 was the misidentified cell line and M14 was the authentic cell line,
      although contradictory evidence has been published, resulting in further
      confusion. To address this question, we obtained early samples of the melanoma
      cell line (M14), a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same donor (ML14), and donor
      serum preserved at the originator's institution. M14 samples were cryopreserved
      in December 1975, before MDA‐MB‐435 cells were established in culture. Through a 
      series of molecular characterizations, including short tandem repeat (STR)
      profiling and cytogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that later samples of M14 and
      MDA‐MB‐435 correspond to samples of M14 frozen in 1975, to the lymphoblastoid
      cell line ML14, and to the melanoma donor's STR profile, sex and blood type. This
      work demonstrates conclusively that M14 is the authentic cell line and MDA‐MB‐435
      is misidentified. With clear provenance information and authentication testing of
      early samples, it is possible to resolve debates regarding the origins of
      problematic cell lines that are widely used in cancer research.

TI  - The Impact of Treatment Preferences in Second-Line Chemotherapy on the Prognosis 
      of HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - Objective: We assessed the impact of treatment preferences in second-line
      chemotherapy on breast cancer prognosis using the SELECT BC study. Methods: The
      SELECT BC study was performed in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer treated with initial chemotherapy. From these patients, 618 were assigned 
      to 2 groups (S-1 group, 309; taxane group, 309). The S-1 and taxane groups were
      each subdivided into 3 groups: crossover group, protocol-recommended group, and
      other group, and the analysis of overall survival (OS) was performed using Cox
      regression with inverse probability weighting, to adjust for postrandomization
      confounding. Results: In the taxane group, the OS of the crossover group (39.6
      months) was better than that of the protocol-recommended group (35.7 months) and 
      the other chemotherapy group (36.9 months) (vs. the protocol-recommended group,
      HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.52–0.98], p = 0.037; vs. the other chemotherapy group, HR 0.71 
      [95% CI 0.43–1.18], p = 0.183). In the S-1 group, there was no statistically
      significant difference in OS between the 3 groups. Conclusion: The study of the
      combination of first-line chemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy showed that
      S-1 might be recommended as a second-line chemotherapy in patients in whom taxane
      was the primary chemotherapy.

TI  - Monitoring deep inspiration breath hold for left‐sided localized breast cancer
      radiotherapy with an in‐house developed laser distance meter system.
PG  - 117-23
AB  - Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) in left‐sided breast cancer radiotherapy is a
      technique to reduce cardiac and pulmonary doses while maintaining target
      coverage. This study aims at evaluating an in‐house developed DIBH system.
      Free‐breathing (FB) and DIBH plans were generated for 22 left‐sided localized
      breast cancer patients who had radiation therapy (RT) after breast‐conserving
      surgery. All patients were treated utilizing an in‐house laser distance measuring
      system. 50 Gy was prescribed, and parameters of interest were target coverage,
      left anterior descending coronary artery, (LAD) and heart doses. Portal images
      were acquired and the reproducibility and stability of DIBH treatment were
      compared to FB. The comparing result shows there is a significant reduction in
      all LAD and heart dose statistics for DIBH compared to FB plans without
      compromising the target coverage. The maximum LAD dose was reduced from 43.7 Gy
      to 29.0 Gy and the volume of the heart receiving >25 Gy was reduced from 3.3% to 
      1.0% using the in‐house system, both statistically significant. The in‐house
      system gave a reproducible and stable DIBH treatment where the systematic error
      ∑, and random error σ, were less than 2.2 mm in all directions, but were not
      significantly better than at FB. The system was well tolerated and all patients
      completed their treatment sessions with DIBH.

TI  - Body Mass Index Mediates the Prognostic Significance of Circulating Tumor Cells
      in Inflammatory Breast Cancer.
PG  - 666-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity (BMI≥30) may be an etiologic and prognostic factor in
      inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). We examined the relationship between BMI,
      pathologic complete response (pCR), and circulating-tumor-cell (CTC) levels in
      IBC. METHODS: Cohort included IBC patients diagnosed 2005–2015 who had
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy during a prospective trial on CTCs and pathologic review
      describing pCR. Chi-square, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards
      models were used to identify clinicopathologic associations with event-free
      survival (EFS). RESULTS: Of 73 patients, 61 (84%) had CTC values, 22 (30%)
      achieved a pCR, and 39 (53%) were obese. There was no difference between obese
      and non-obese patients for pCR rates (31% vs. 29%, p=0.90) or presence of CTCs
      (23% vs. 26%, p=0.80). Among non-obese patients, CTCs were associated with worse 
      EFS (HR 11.69, p<0.01), but among obese patients, there was no difference in EFS 
      between those with and without CTCs. CONCLUSIONS: BMI mediates CTCs’ prognostic
      significance in IBC.

TI  - Mammographic Density Reduction as a Prognostic Marker for Postmenopausal Breast
      Cancer: Results Using a Joint Longitudinal-Survival Modeling Approach.
PG  - 1065-73
AB  - Previous studies have linked reductions in mammographic density after a breast
      cancer diagnosis to an improved prognosis. These studies focused on short-term
      change, using a 2-stage process, treating estimated change as a fixed covariate
      in a survival model. We propose the use of a joint longitudinal-survival model.
      This enables us to model long-term trends in density while accounting for dropout
      as well as for measurement error. We studied the change in mammographic density
      after a breast cancer diagnosis and its association with prognosis (measured by
      cause-specific mortality), overall and with respect to hormone replacement
      therapy and tamoxifen treatment. We included 1,740 women aged 50–74 years,
      diagnosed with breast cancer in Sweden during 1993–1995, with follow-up until
      2008. They had a total of 6,317 mammographic density measures available from the 
      first 5 years of follow-up, including baseline measures. We found that the impact
      of the withdrawal of hormone replacement therapy on density reduction was larger 
      than that of tamoxifen treatment. Unlike previous studies, we found that there
      was an association between density reduction and survival, both for
      tamoxifen-treated women and women who were not treated with tamoxifen.

TI  - Development of the breast immobilization system in prone setup: The effect of bra
      in prone position to improve the breast setup error.
PG  - 155-60
AB  - Purpose/objective(s): Accurate and reproducible positioning of the breast is
      difficult due to its deformability and softness; thus, targeting a breast tumor
      or tumor bed with fractionated radiotherapy using external beam radiation is
      difficult. The aim of this study was to develop a novel bra to aid in breast
      immobilization in the prone position. Materials & methods: To assess the accuracy
      of prone position fixation of breast tumors, 33 breast cancer patients with 34
      lesions were recruited. The bra used in this verification was customized from a
      commercially available bra. Duplicate MRI were acquired in the prone position,
      alternating with and without the bra, and for each series, patients were asked to
      step off the MRI table and re‐set up in the prone position. Patients were also
      asked to remove and re‐fit the bra for the second MRI. Each pair of images were
      superimposed to match the shape of the skin surface, and the maximum difference
      in tumor geometric center in three axes was measured. The required set up margin 
      was calculated as: required margin = mean difference in geometric center + 2.5
      standard deviation. The volumetric overlap of the tumor, as well as contouring
      uncertainties, was evaluated using contour analysis software. Results: The median
      breast size was 498 cc. The required margins for the lateral, vertical, and
      longitudinal directions were estimated to be 4.1, 4.1, and 5.0 mm, respectively, 
      with the bra, and 5.1, 6.9, and 6.7 mm, respectively, without the bra. These
      margins covered the dislocation of more than 33 lesions in total. With the bra,
      33 lesions had achieved an objective overlap of 95% and 99% with 2 and 4 mm
      margins, respectively, whereas 4 and 8 mm, respectively, were needed without the 
      bra. Conclusion: The use of an immobilizing bra reduced the setup margin for
      prone position fixation of breast tumors.

TI  - Breast tissue stiffness estimation for surgical guidance using gravity-induced
      excitation.
PG  - 4756-76
AB  - Tissue stiffness interrogation is fundamental in breast cancer diagnosis and
      treatment. Furthermore, biomechanical models for predicting breast deformations
      have been created for several breast cancer applications. Within these
      applications, constitutive mechanical properties must be defined and the accuracy
      of this estimation directly impacts the overall performance of the model. In this
      study, we present an image-derived computational framework to obtain
      quantitative, patient specific stiffness properties for application in
      image-guided breast cancer surgery and interventions. The method uses two MR
      acquisitions of the breast in different supine gravity-loaded configurations to
      fit mechanical properties to a biomechanical breast model. A reproducibility
      assessment of the method was performed in a test–retest study using healthy
      volunteers and was further characterized in simulation. In five human data sets, 
      the within subject coefficient of variation ranged from 10.7% to 27% and the
      intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.91–0.944 for assessment of
      fibroglandular and adipose tissue stiffness. In simulation, fibroglandular
      content and deformation magnitude were shown to have significant effects on the
      shape and convexity of the objective function defined by image similarity. These 
      observations provide an important step forward in characterizing the use of
      nonrigid image registration methodologies in conjunction with biomechanical
      models to estimate tissue stiffness. In addition, the results suggest that
      stiffness estimation methods using gravity-induced excitation can reliably and
      feasibly be implemented in breast cancer surgery/intervention workflows.

TI  - Weight and weight changes in early adulthood and later breast cancer risk.
PG  - 2003-14
AB  - Obesity is a well-established cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. However,
      early life adiposity is inversely associated with breast cancer incidence. To
      understand these conflicting relations, we use validated measures to assess
      adiposity in childhood and late adolescence, as well as weight change, in
      relation to total invasive breast cancer incidence and receptor subtypes.We
      conducted a prospective observational study among 74,177 women from the Nurses’
      Health Study from 1980–2012, with updated risk factors every 2 years during which
      4965 incident invasive breast cancers occurred.Overall, weight at age 18 was
      inversely associated with both premenopausal (HR per 30 kg = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.39 
      – 0.71) and postmenopausal (HR per 30 kg = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72 – 0.92) breast
      cancer which was largely explained by adiposity at age 10. Long-term weight gain 
      from age 18 both during premenopause and postmenopause were positively associated
      with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. However, premenopausal weight gain was
      not related to premenopausal breast cancer risk. Furthermore, weight gain since
      age 18 was positively associated with ER+/PR+ postmenopausal breast cancer (HR
      per 30 kg = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.36 – 1.65) but not ER+/PR− (HR per 30 kg = 0.96, 95%
      CI = 0.78 – 1.19) or ER−/PR− (HR per 30 kg = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.95 – 1.42)
      postmenopausal breast cancer.Overall, 17% of ER+/PR+ postmenopausal breast cancer
      and 14% of total postmenopausal breast cancer are attributable to weight gain of 
      > 5 kg since age 18.

TI  - State Variation in the Receipt of a Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy Among
      Women Who Received a Diagnosis of Invasive Unilateral Early-Stage Breast Cancer
      in the United States, 2004-2012.
PG  - 648-57
AB  - Importance: The use of contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (CPMs) among
      patients with invasive unilateral breast cancer has increased substantially
      during the past decade in the United States despite the lack of evidence for
      survival benefit. However, whether this trend varies by state or whether it is
      correlated with changes in proportions of reconstructive surgery among these
      patients is unclear. Objective: To determine state variation in the temporal
      trend and in the proportion of CPMs among women with early-stage unilateral
      breast cancer treated with surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: A
      retrospective cohort study of 1.2 million women 20 years of age or older
      diagnosed with invasive unilateral early-stage breast cancer and treated with
      surgery from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2012, in 45 states and the
      District of Columbia as compiled by the North American Association of Central
      Cancer Registries. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2015, to August 31,
      2016. Exposure: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Main Outcomes and
      Measures: Temporal changes in the proportion of CPMs among women with early-stage
      unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery by age and state, overall and in
      relation to changes in the proportions of those who underwent reconstructive
      surgery. Results: Among the 1 224 947 women with early-stage breast cancer
      treated with surgery, the proportion who underwent a CPM nationally increased
      between 2004 and 2012 from 3.6% (4013 of 113 001) to 10.4% (12 890 of 124 231)
      for those 45 years or older and from 10.5% (1879 of 17 862) to 33.3% (5237 of
      15 745) for those aged 20 to 44 years. The increase was evident in all states,
      although the magnitude of the increase varied substantially across states. For
      example, among women 20 to 44 years of age, the proportion who underwent a CPM
      from 2004-2006 to 2010-2012 increased from 14.9% (317 of 2121) to 24.8% (436 of
      1755) (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.46-1.89) in New Jersey compared
      with an increase from 9.8% (162 of 1657) to 32.2% (495 of 1538) (PR, 3.29; 95%
      CI, 2.80-3.88) in Virginia. In this age group, CPM proportions for the period
      from 2010 to 2012 were over 42% in the contiguous states of Nebraska, Missouri,
      Colorado, Iowa, and South Dakota. From 2004 to 2012, the proportion of
      reconstructive surgical procedures among women aged 20 to 44 years who were
      diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and received a CPM increased in many
      states; however, it did not correlate with the proportion of women who received a
      CPM. Conclusions and Relevance: The increase in the proportion of CPMs among
      women with early-stage unilateral breast cancer treated with surgery varied
      substantially across states. Notably, in 5 contiguous Midwest states, nearly half
      of young women with invasive early-stage breast cancer underwent a CPM from 2010 
      to 2012. Future studies should examine the reasons for the geographic variation
      and increasing trend in the use of CPMs.

TI  - Optimization of intra‐voxel incoherent motion measurement in diffusion‐weighted
      imaging of breast cancer.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to optimize intra‐voxel incoherent motion 
      (IVIM) measurement in diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) of breast cancer by
      separating perfusion and diffusion effects through the determination of an
      optimal threshold b‐value, thus benign and cancerous breast tissues can be
      accurately differentiated using IVIM‐derived diffusion and perfusion parameters. 
      Materials and Methods: Twenty‐eight patients, with biopsy‐confirmed breast
      cancers, were studied with a 3T MRI scanner, using T1‐weighted dynamic
      contrast‐enhanced MRI images, and diffusion‐weighted images with nine b‐values,
      ranging from 0 to 1000 s/mm². IVIM‐derived parameter maps for tissue diffusion
      coefficients D, perfusion fraction f, and pseudo‐diffusion coefficients D* were
      computed using the segmented fitting method with optimized threshold b‐value, and
      the sum of squared residuals (SSR) were calculated for IVIM‐derived parameters in
      different breast lesions. Results: The IVIM analysis method developed in this
      work can separate perfusion and diffusion effects with the optimal threshold
      b‐value of 300 s/mm², and the results of diffusion and perfusion parameters from 
      IVIM analysis can be used to differentiate pathological changes in breast
      tissues. It was found that the averages and standard deviations of the diffusion 
      and perfusion parameters, D, f, D*, are the following, for malignant, benign and 
      normal breast tissues respectively: D (0.813 ± 0.225 × 10−3 mm2/s, 1.437 ± 0.538 
      × 10−3 mm2/s, 1.838 ± 0.213 × 10−3 mm2/s), f (10.73 ± 3.44%, 7.86 ± 3.70%, 8.92 ±
      3.72%), D* (15.23 ± 12.17×10−3 mm²/s, 12.02 ± 3.19 × 10−3 mm2/s, 12.03 ± 7.21 ×
      10−3 mm2/s). Conclusion: IVIM‐derived diffusion and perfusion parameter maps
      depend highly on the choice of threshold b‐value. Using the methodology developed
      in this work, and with the optimized threshold b‐value, the diffusion and
      perfusion parameters of breast tissues can be accurately assessed, making IVIM
      MRI a technique of choice for differential diagnosis of breast cancer.

TI  - Brain Metastases in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Study.
PG  - 1069-77
AB  - Question: What are the incidence and prognosis of patients with breast cancer and
      brain metastases at diagnosis? Findings: In this population-based cohort study,
      patients with triple-negative and hormone receptor–negative human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2–positive subtypes and metastatic disease to any distant 
      site harbored the highest likelihood (11.37% and 11.45%, respectively) of
      presenting with brain metastases at diagnosis of breast cancer. The prognosis of 
      patients with triple-negative disease was poorest (median survival, 6 months).
      Meaning: Future studies evaluating the utility of screening brain magnetic
      resonance imaging among patients at high risk of brain metastases may be
      warranted.

TI  - Association of the Timing of Pregnancy With Survival in Women With Breast Cancer.
PG  - 659-65
AB  - Importance: Increasing numbers of women experience pregnancy around the time of, 
      or after, a diagnosis of breast cancer. Understanding the effect of pregnancy on 
      survival in women with breast cancer will help in the counseling and treatment of
      these women. Objective: To compare the overall survival of women diagnosed with
      breast cancer during pregnancy or in the postpartum period with that of women who
      had breast cancer but did not become pregnant. Design, Setting, and Participants:
      This population-based, retrospective cohort study linked health administrative
      databases in Ontario, Canada, comprising 7553 women aged 20 to 45 years at the
      time of diagnosis with invasive breast cancer, from January 1, 2003, to December 
      31, 2014. Exposures: Any pregnancy in the period from 5 years before, until 5
      years after, the index date of the diagnosis of breast cancer. Women were
      classified into the following 4 exposure groups: no pregnancy (the referent),
      pregnancy before breast cancer, pregnancy-associated breast cancer, and pregnancy
      following breast cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five-year actuarial survival
      rates for all exposure groups, age-adjusted and multivariable hazard ratios [HRs]
      of pregnancy for overall survival for all exposure groups, and time-dependent
      hazard ratios for women with pregnancy following breast cancer. Results: Among
      the 7553 women in the study (mean age at diagnosis, 39.1 years; median, 40 years;
      range, 20-44 years) the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 87.5% (95% CI,
      86.5%-88.4%) for women with no pregnancy, 85.3% (95% CI, 82.8%-87.8%) for women
      with pregnancy before breast cancer (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI,
      0.85-1.27; P = .73), and 82.1% (95% CI, 78.3%-85.9%) for women with
      pregnancy-associated breast cancer (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI,
      0.91-1.53; P = .20). The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 96.7% (95% CI,
      94.1%-99.3%) for women who had pregnancy 6 months or more after diagnosis of
      breast cancer, vs 87.5% (95% CI, 86.5%-88.4%) for women with no pregnancy)
      (age-adjusted HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.49; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: 
      Pregnancy did not adversely affect survival in women with breast cancer. For
      breast cancer survivors who wish to conceive, the risk of death is lowest if
      pregnancy occurs 6 months or more after diagnosis.

TI  - Adjuvant Capecitabine in Combination With Docetaxel, Epirubicin, and
      Cyclophosphamide for Early Breast Cancer: The Randomized Clinical FinXX Trial.
PG  - 793-800
AB  - Question: Does integration of capecitabine into a taxane- and
      anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen improve survival as adjuvant
      treatment of early breast cancer? Findings: In the FinXX trial, patients randomly
      allocated to receive a capecitabine-containing regimen did not survive longer
      than patients treated without capecitabine during a median follow-up of 10.3
      years. The subset of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) survived 
      longer when treated with the capecitabine-containing regimen. Meaning:
      Integration of capecitabine into adjuvant chemotherapy did not prolong survival, 
      but patients with TNBC may benefit from capecitabine.

TI  - Intrinsic Subtypes and Gene Expression Profiles in Primary and Metastatic Breast 
      Cancer.
PG  - 2213-21
AB  - Biological changes that occur during metastatic progression of breast cancer are 
      still incompletely characterized. In this study, we compared intrinsic molecular 
      subtypes and gene expression in 123 paired primary and metastatic tissues from
      breast cancer patients. Intrinsic subtype was identified using a PAM50 classifier
      and χ2 tests determined the differences in variable distribution. The rate of
      subtype conversion was 0% in basal-like tumors, 23.1% in HER2-enriched (HER2-E)
      tumors, 30.0% in luminal B tumors, and 55.3% in luminal A tumors. In 40.2% of
      cases, luminal A tumors converted to luminal B tumors, whereas in 14.3% of cases 
      luminal A and B tumors converted to HER2-E tumors. We identified 47 genes that
      were expressed differentially in metastatic versus primary disease. Metastatic
      tumors were enriched for proliferation-related and migration-related genes and
      diminished for luminal-related genes. Expression of proliferation-related genes
      were better at predicting overall survival in metastatic disease (OSmet) when
      analyzed in metastatic tissue rather than primary tissue. In contrast, a
      basal-like gene expression signature was better at predicting OSmet in primary
      disease compared with metastatic tissue. We observed correlations between time to
      tumor relapse and the magnitude of changes of proliferation, luminal B, or HER2-E
      signatures in metastatic versus primary disease. Although the intrinsic subtype
      was largely maintained during metastatic progression, luminal/HER2-negative
      tumors acquired a luminal B or HER2-E profile during metastatic progression,
      likely reflecting tumor evolution or acquisition of estrogen independence.
      Overall, our analysis revealed the value of stratifying gene expression by both
      cancer subtype and tissue type, providing clinicians more refined tools to
      evaluate prognosis and treatment.

TI  - Lung volume reproducibility under ABC control and self‐sustained breath‐holding.
PG  - 154-62
AB  - An Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) can be employed to induce breath‐holds
      during CT imaging and radiotherapy of lung, breast and liver cancer, and recently
      during lung cancer MRI. The apparatus measures and controls respiratory volume,
      hence subject lung volume reproducibility is its principal measure of
      effectiveness. To assess ABC control quality, the intra‐session reproducibility
      of ABC‐induced lung volumes was evaluated and compared with that reached by
      applying the clinical standard of operator‐guided self‐sustained breath‐holds on 
      healthy volunteers during MRI. Inter‐session reproducibility was investigated by 
      repeating ABC‐controlled breath‐holds on a second visit. Additionally, lung
      volume agreement with ABC devices used with different imaging modalities in the
      same institution (MR, CT), or for a breast trial treatment, was assessed. Lung
      volumes were derived from three‐dimensional (3D) T1‐weighted MRI datasets by
      three observers employing semiautomatic lung delineation on a radiotherapy
      treatment planning system. Inter‐observer variability was less than 6% of the
      delineated lung volumes. Lung volume agreement between the different conditions
      over all subjects was investigated using descriptive statistics. The ABC
      equipment dedicated for MR application exhibited good intra‐session and
      inter‐session lung volume reproducibility (1.8% and 3% lung volume variability on
      average, respectively). MR‐assessed lung volumes were similar using different ABC
      equipment dedicated to MR, CT, or breast radiotherapy. Overall, lung volumes
      controlled by the same or different ABC devices agreed better than with
      self‐controlled breath‐holds, as suggested by the average ABC variation of 1.8%
      of the measured lung volumes (99 mL), compared to the 4.1% (226 mL) variability
      observed on average with self‐sustained breath‐holding.

TI  - Genomic characterization of HER2-positive breast cancer and response to
      neoadjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy—results from the ACOSOG Z1041 (Alliance)
      trial.
PG  - 1070-7
AB  - Background: HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification and its corresponding overexpression 
      are present in 15–30% of invasive breast cancers. While HER2-targeted agents are 
      effective treatments, resistance remains a major cause of death. The American
      College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1041 trial (NCT00513292) was designed to
      compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of distinct regimens of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab, but ultimately identified no
      difference. Patients and methods: In supplement to tissues from 37 Z1041 cases,
      11 similarly treated cases were obtained from a single institution study
      (NCT00353483). We have extracted genomic DNA from both pre-treatment tumor
      biopsies and blood of these 48 cases, and performed whole genome (WGS) and exome 
      sequencing. Coincident with these efforts, we have generated RNA-seq profiles
      from 42 of the tumor biopsies. Among patients in this cohort, 24 (50%) achieved a
      pCR. Results: We have characterized the genomic landscape of HER2-positive breast
      cancer and investigated associations between genomic features and pCR. Cases
      assigned to the HER2-enriched subtype by RNA-seq analysis were more likely to
      achieve a pCR compared to the luminal, basal-like, or normal-like subtypes (19/27
      versus 3/15; P = 0.0032). Mutational events led to the generation of putatively
      active neoantigens, but were overall not associated with pCR. ERBB2 and GRB7 were
      the genes most commonly observed in fusion events, and genomic copy number
      analysis of the ERBB2 locus indicated that cases with either no observable or
      low-level ERBB2 amplification were less likely to achieve a pCR (7/8 versus
      17/40; P = 0.048). Moreover, among cases that achieved a pCR, tumors consistently
      expressed immune signatures that may contribute to therapeutic response.
      Conclusion: The identification of these features suggests that it may be possible
      to predict, at the time of diagnosis, those HER2-positive breast cancer patients 
      who will not respond to treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab.

TI  - Sleep duration and breast cancer prognosis: perspectives from the Women's Healthy
      Eating and Living Study.
PG  - 581-9
AB  - Purpose: To examine whether baseline sleep duration or changes in sleep duration 
      are associated with breast cancer prognosis among early-stage breast cancer
      survivors in the multi-center Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study. Methods:
      Data were collected from 1995 to 2010. Analysis included 3047 women. Sleep
      duration was self-reported at baseline and follow-up intervals. Cox proportional 
      hazard models were used to investigate whether baseline sleep duration was
      associated with breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and
      all-cause mortality. Time-varying models investigated whether changes in sleep
      duration were associated with breast cancer prognosis. Results: Compared to women
      who slept 7–8 h/night at baseline, sleeping ≥9 h/night was associated with a 48% 
      increased risk of breast cancer recurrence (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, 95%
      Confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 2.00), a 52% increased risk of breast
      cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09, 2.13), and a 43% greater risk of
      all-cause mortality (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07, 1.92). Time-varying models showed
      analogous increased risk in those who inconsistently slept ≥9 h/night (all P <
      0.05), but not in those who consistently slept ≥9 h/night. Conclusions:
      Consistent long or short sleep, which may reflect inter-individual variability in
      the need for sleep, does not appear to influence prognosis among early-stage
      breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Question: Can breast cancer of the chest wall be treated with chemoimmunotherapy?
      Findings: In a single-arm phase 2 clinical trial of 14 patients, 5 achieved a
      compete response and 5 were partial responders for an overall response rate of
      72%. Elevated pretreatment levels of peripheral blood programmed death-1–positive
      T cells and monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells were associated with
      suboptimal response. Meaning: Even in treatment-refractory disease,
      chemoimmunotherapy can induce remission. Peripheral blood biomarkers associated
      with response can be identified.

TI  - Electromagnetic tracking (EMT) technology for improved treatment quality
      assurance in interstitial brachytherapy.
PG  - 211-22
AB  - Electromagnetic Tracking (EMT) is a novel technique for error detection and
      quality assurance (QA) in interstitial high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR‐iBT).
      The purpose of this study is to provide a concept for data acquisition developed 
      as part of a clinical evaluation study on the use of EMT during interstitial
      treatment of breast cancer patients. The stability, accuracy, and precision of
      EMT‐determined dwell positions were quantified. Dwell position reconstruction
      based on EMT was investigated on CT table, HDR table and PDR bed to examine the
      influence on precision and accuracy in a typical clinical workflow. All
      investigations were performed using a precise PMMA phantom. The track of
      catheters inserted in that phantom was measured by manually inserting a 5 degree 
      of freedom (DoF) sensor while recording the position of three 6DoF fiducial
      sensors on the phantom surface to correct motion influences. From the corrected
      data, dwell positions were reconstructed along the catheter's track. The accuracy
      of the EMT‐determined dwell positions was quantified by the residual distances to
      reference dwell positions after using a rigid registration. Precision and
      accuracy were investigated for different phantom‐table and sensor‐field generator
      (FG) distances. The measured precision of the EMT‐determined dwell positions was 
      ≤ 0.28 mm (95th percentile). Stability tests showed a drift of 0.03 mm in the
      first 20 min of use. Sudden shaking of the FG or (large) metallic objects close
      to the FG degrade the precision. The accuracy with respect to the reference dwell
      positions was on all clinical tables < 1 mm at 200 mm FG distance and 120 mm
      phantom‐table distance. Phantom measurements showed that EMT‐determined
      localization of dwell positions in HDR‐iBT is stable, precise, and sufficiently
      accurate for clinical assessment. The presented method may be viable for clinical
      applications in HDR‐iBT, like implant definition, error detection or
      quantification of uncertainties. Further clinical investigations are needed.

TI  - Algorithms for Prediction of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score using
      Clinicopathologic Data: A Review and Comparison using an Independent Dataset.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Purpose: Given the potential savings in cost and resource utilization, several
      algorithms have been proposed to predict Oncotype DX recurrence score (ODX RS)
      using commonly acquired histopathologic variables. Although promising, additional
      independent validation of these surrogate markers is needed prior to guiding
      patient management. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 305
      patients with invasive breast cancer at our institution that had ODX RS
      available. We selected five equations that provide a surrogate measure of ODX as 
      previously published by Klein et. al. (Magee equations 1-3), Gage et. al., and
      Tang et. al. All equations used estrogen receptor status and progesterone
      receptor status along with different combinations of grade, proliferation indices
      (Ki-67, mitotic rate), HER2 status, and tumor size. Results: Of all surrogate
      scores tested, the Magee equation 2 provided the highest correlation with ODX
      both with regards to raw score (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.66 95% CI
      0.59-0.72) and categorical correlation (Cohen’s kappa = 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). 
      Although Magee equation 2 provided a way to reliably identify high risk disease
      by assigning 95% of the patients with high ODX RS to either the intermediate or
      high risk group, it was unable to reliably identify the potential for patients to
      have intermediate or high risk disease by ODX (66% of such patients identified). 
      Conclusions: Although commonly available surrogates for ODX appear to predict
      high risk ODX RS, they are unable to reliably rule out the presence of patients
      with intermediate risk disease by ODX. Given the potential benefit of adjuvant
      chemotherapy in women with intermediate risk disease by ODX, current surrogates
      are unable to safely substitute for ODX. Characterizing the true recurrence risk 
      in patients with intermediate risk disease by ODX is critical to the clinical
      adoption of current surrogate markers and is an area of ongoing clinical trials.

TI  - Phase I dose escalation study of the PI3kinase pathway inhibitor BKM120 and the
      oral poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib for the treatment of 
      high-grade serous ovarian and breast cancer.
PG  - 512-8
AB  - Background: Based upon preclinical synergy in murine models, we carried out a
      phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicities,
      pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers of response for the combination of BKM120, a
      PI3K inhibitor, and olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. Patients and methods: Olaparib
      was administered twice daily (tablet formulation) and BKM120 daily on a 28-day
      cycle, both orally. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was employed with the primary 
      objective of defining the combination MTD, and secondary objectives were to
      define toxicities, activity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Eligibility included
      recurrent breast (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC); dose-expansion cohorts at the MTD
      were enrolled for each cancer. Results: In total, 69 of 70 patients enrolled
      received study treatment; one patient never received study treatment because of
      ineligibility. Twenty-four patients had BC; 46 patients had OC. Thirty-five
      patients had a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAm). Two DLTs (grade 3 transaminitis
      and hyperglycemia) were observed at DL0 (BKM120 60 mg/olaparib and 100 mg
      b.i.d.). The MTD was determined to be BKM120 50 mg q.d. and olaparib 300 mg
      b.i.d. (DL8). Additional DLTs included grade 3 depression and transaminitis,
      occurring early in cycle 2 (DL7). Anticancer activity was observed in BC and OC
      and in gBRCAm and gBRCA wild-type (gBRCAwt) patients. Conclusions: BKM120 and
      olaparib can be co-administered, but the combination requires attenuation of the 
      BKM120 dose. Clinical benefit was observed in both gBRCAm and gBRCAwt pts.
      Randomized phase II studies will be needed to further define the efficacy of
      PI3K/PARP-inhibitor combinations as compared with a PARP inhibitor alone.

TI  - Mammography rates after the 2009 revision to the United States Preventive
      Services Task Force breast cancer screening recommendation.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - Background: In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
      recommended against routine mammography screening for women aged 40–49 years.
      This revised recommendation was widely criticized and has sparked off intense
      debate. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the revised
      recommendation on the proportion of women receiving mammograms and how the effect
      varied by age. Methods: We identified women who had continuous health insurance
      coverage and who did not have breast cancer between 2008 and 2011 in the Truven
      Health MarketScan Commercial Claims Databases using mammogram procedure codes.
      Using women aged 50–59 years as a control group, we used a
      differences-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of the revised
      recommendation on the proportion of women ages 40–49 years who received at least 
      one mammogram. We also compared the age-specific changes in the proportion of
      women ages 35–59 years who were screened before and after the release of the
      revised recommendation. Results: The proportion of women screened among the 40–49
      and 50–59 age groups were 58.5 and 62.5%, respectively, between 2008 and 2009,
      and 56.9 and 62.0%, respectively, between 2010 and 2011. After 2009, the
      proportion of women screened declined by 1.2 percentage point among women aged
      40–49 years (P < 0.01). The proportion of women screened decreased for all ages, 
      and decreases were larger among women closer to the 40-year threshold.
      Conclusions: The 2009 USPSTF breast cancer recommendation was followed by a small
      reduction in the proportion of insured women aged 40–49 years who were screened. 
      Reductions were larger among women at the younger end of the age range, who
      presumably had less prior experience with mammography than women nearing 50.

TI  - An Antiestrogenic Activity Score for tamoxifen and its metabolites is associated 
      with breast cancer outcome.
PG  - 567-74
AB  - Purpose: Endoxifen concentrations have been associated with breast cancer
      recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients. However, tamoxifen itself and other
      metabolites also show antiestrogenic anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to develop a comprehensive Antiestrogenic Activity Score (AAS),
      which accounts for concentration and antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen and
      three metabolites. An association between the AAS and recurrence-free survival
      was investigated and compared to a previously published threshold for endoxifen
      concentrations of 5.97 ng/mL. Patients and methods: The antiestrogenic activities
      of tamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen, and N-desmethyltamoxifen
      were determined in a cell proliferation assay. The AAS was determined by
      calculating the sum of each metabolite concentration multiplied by an IC50 ratio,
      relative to tamoxifen. The AAS was calculated for 1370 patients with estrogen
      receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer. An association between AAS and
      recurrence was investigated using Cox regression and compared with the 5.97 ng/mL
      endoxifen threshold using concordance indices. Results: An AAS threshold of 1798 
      was associated with recurrence-free survival, hazard ratio (HR) 0.67 (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.47–0.96), bias corrected after bootstrap HR 0.69 (95% 
      CI 0.48–0.99). The concordance indices for AAS and endoxifen did not
      significantly differ; however, using the AAS threshold instead of endoxifen led
      to different dose recommendations for 5.2% of the patients. Conclusions:
      Endoxifen concentrations can serve as a proxy for the antiestrogenic effect of
      tamoxifen and metabolites. However, for the aggregate effect of tamoxifen and
      three metabolites, defined by an integrative algorithm, a trend towards improving
      treatment is seen and moreover, is significantly associated with breast cancer
      recurrence.

TI  - Discordance between Original and Central Laboratories in ER and HER2 Results in a
      Diverse, Population-Based Sample.
PG  - 375-84
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the discordance between original and central laboratories
      in estrogen receptor (ER) status, in tumors originally deemed to be ER-negative, 
      and in HER2 status in a diverse population-based sample. Methods: In a follow up 
      study of 1785 women with Stage I–III breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 – 2007 
      in the Detroit and Los Angeles County SEER registry catchment areas, participants
      were asked to consent to reassessment of ER (in tumors originally deemed to be
      ER-negative) and HER2 status on archival tumor samples approximately four years
      after diagnosis. Specimens (either slides or blocks) were centrally prepared and 
      analyzed for ER and HER2 using standardized methods and the guidelines of the
      American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists.
      Analyses determined the discordance between original and central laboratories.
      Results: 132 (31%) of those eligible for ER reassessment and 367 (21%) eligible
      for HER2 reassessment had archival blocks reassessed centrally. ER discordance
      was only 6%. HER2 discordance by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 26%, but final
      HER2 results—employing FISH in tumors that were IHC 2+ at the central
      laboratory—were discordant in only 6%. Half of the original laboratories did not 
      perform their own assays. Conclusions: Discordance between original and central
      laboratories in two large metropolitan areas was low in this population-based
      sample compared to previously-reported patient samples. Centralization of testing
      for key pathology variables appears to be occurring in many hospitals. In
      addition, quality improvement efforts may have preceded the publication and
      dissemination of specialty society guidelines.

TI  - Development of a deep inspiration breath‐hold system for radiotherapy utilizing a
      laser distance measurer.
PG  - 260-4
AB  - Deep inspiration breath‐hold (DIBH) is a technique for treating left‐sided breast
      cancer (LSBC). In modern radiotherapy, one of the main aims is to exclude the
      heart from the beam aperture with an individualized beam design for LSBC. A deep 
      inhalation will raise the chest wall while the volume of the lungs increase, this
      will again push the heart away from the breast to be treated. There are a few
      commercial DIBH systems, both invasive and noninvasive. We present an alternative
      noninvasive DIBH system based upon an industrial laser distance measurer. This
      system can be installed in a treatment room at a low cost; it is very easy to use
      and requires limited amount of training for the personnel and the patient. The
      system is capable of measuring the position of the chest wall with high frequency
      and precision in real time. The patient views its breathing curve through video
      glasses, and gets instructions during the treatment session. The system is well
      tolerated by test subjects due to its noninvasiveness.

TI  - Lgr6 labels a rare population of mammary gland progenitor cells that are able to 
      originate luminal mammary tumours.
PG  - 1346-56
AB  - The mammary gland is composed of a complex cellular hierarchy with unusual
      postnatal plasticity. The identities of stem/progenitor cell populations, as well
      as tumour-initiating cells that give rise to breast cancer, are incompletely
      understood. Here we show that Lgr6 marks rare populations of cells in both basal 
      and luminal mammary gland compartments in mice. Lineage tracing analysis showed
      that Lgr6+ cells are unipotent progenitors, which expand clonally during puberty 
      but diminish in adulthood. In pregnancy or upon stimulation with ovarian
      hormones, adult Lgr6+ cells regained proliferative potency and their progeny
      formed alveoli over repeated pregnancies. Oncogenic mutations in Lgr6+ cells
      resulted in expansion of luminal cells, culminating in mammary gland tumours.
      Conversely, depletion of Lgr6+ cells in the MMTV-PyMT model of mammary
      tumourigenesis significantly impaired tumour growth. Thus, Lgr6 marks mammary
      gland progenitor cells that can initiate tumours, and cells of luminal breast
      tumours required for efficient tumour maintenance.

TI  - Intrinsic Subtype and Therapeutic Response Among HER2-Positive Breast Tumors from
      the NCCTG (Alliance) N9831 Trial.
LID - djw207
AB  - Background: Genomic data from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive
      (HER2+) tumors were analyzed to assess the association between intrinsic subtype 
      and clinical outcome in a large, well-annotated patient cohort.Methods: Samples
      from the NCCTG (Alliance) N9831 trial were analyzed using the Prosigna algorithm 
      on the NanoString platform to define intrinsic subtype, risk of recurrence
      scores, and risk categories for 1392 HER2+ tumors. Subtypes were evaluated for
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox model analysis
      following adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 484) or chemotherapy plus trastuzumab
      (n = 908). All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Patients with HER2+
      tumors from N9831 were primarily scored as HER2-enriched (72.1%). These
      individuals received statistically significant benefit from trastuzumab (hazard
      ratio [HR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 0.89, P = .005), as did
      the patients (291 of 1392) with luminal-type tumors (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.32 to 
      0.85, P = .01). Patients with basal-like tumors (97 of 1392) did not have
      statistically significantly better RFS when treated with trastuzumab and
      chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.53 to 2.13, 
      P = .87).Conclusions: The majority of clinically defined HER2-positive tumors
      were classified as HER2-enriched or luminal using the Prosigna algorithm.
      Intrinsic subtype alone cannot replace conventional histopathological evaluation 
      of HER2 status because many tumors that are classified as luminal A or luminal B 
      will benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab if that subtype is accompanied by HER2
      overexpression. However, among tumors that overexpress HER2, we speculate that
      assessment of intrinsic subtype may influence treatment, particularly with
      respect to evaluating alternative therapeutic approaches for that subset of
      HER2-positive tumors of the basal-like subtype.

TI  - Continuous measurement of breast tumor hormone receptor expression: a comparison 
      of two computational pathology platforms.
PG  - 428-34
AB  - Background: Computational pathology platforms incorporate digital microscopy with
      sophisticated image analysis to permit rapid, continuous measurement of protein
      expression. We compared two computational pathology platforms on their
      measurement of breast tumor estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)
      expression. Methods: Breast tumor microarrays from the Nurses’ Health Study were 
      stained for ER (n=592) and PR (n=187). One expert pathologist scored cases as
      positive if ≥1% of tumor nuclei exhibited stain. ER and PR were then measured
      with the Definiens Tissue Studio (automated) and Aperio Digital Pathology
      (user-supervised) platforms. Platform-specific measurements were compared using
      boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation statistics. Classification of ER and PR 
      positivity by platform-specific measurements was evaluated with areas under
      receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) from univariable logistic
      regression models, using expert pathologist classification as the standard.
      Results: Both platforms showed considerable overlap in continuous measurements of
      ER and PR between positive and negative groups classified by expert pathologist. 
      Platform-specific measurements were strongly and positively correlated with one
      another (rho≥0.77). The user-supervised Aperio workflow performed slightly better
      than the automated Definiens workflow at classifying ER positivity
      (AUCAperio=0.97; AUCDefiniens=0.90; difference=0.07, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.09) and PR
      positivity (AUCAperio=0.94; AUCDefiniens=0.87; difference=0.07, 95% CI: 0.03,
      0.12). Conclusion: Paired hormone receptor expression measurements from two
      different computational pathology platforms agreed well with one another. The
      user-supervised workflow yielded better classification accuracy than the
      automated workflow. Appropriately validated computational pathology algorithms
      enrich molecular epidemiology studies with continuous protein expression data and
      may accelerate tumor biomarker discovery.

TI  - Clinical and therapeutic relevance of the metabolic oncogene fatty acid synthase 
      in HER2+ breast cancer.
PG  - 687-98
AB  - Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key lipogenic enzyme for de novo fatty acid
      biosynthesis and a druggable metabolic oncoprotein that is activated in most
      human cancers. We evaluated whether the HER2-driven lipogenic phenotype might
      represent a biomarker for sensitivity to pharmacological FASN blockade. A
      majority of clinically HER2-positive tumors were scored as FASN overexpressors in
      a series of almost 200 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Re-classification
      of HER2-positive breast tumors based on FASN gene expression predicted a
      significantly inferior relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival in
      HER2+/FASN+ patients. Notably, non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells
      engineered to overexpress HER2 upregulated FASN gene expression, and the FASN
      inhibitor C75 abolished HER2-induced anchorage-independent growth and survival.
      Furthermore, in the presence of high concentrations of C75, HER2-negative MCF-7
      breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 (MCF-7/HER2) had significantly higher
      levels of apoptosis than HER2-negative cells. Finally, C75 at non-cytotoxic
      concentrations significantly reduced the capacity of MCF-7/HER2 cells to form
      mammospheres, an in vitro indicator of cancer stem-like cells. Collectively, our 
      findings strongly suggest that the HER2-FASN lipogenic axis delineates a group of
      breast cancer patients that might benefit from treatment with therapeutic
      regimens containing FASN inhibitors.

TI  - Equivalent survival after nipple-sparing compared to non-nipple-sparing
      mastectomy: data from California, 1988–2013.
PG  - 333-8
AB  - Purpose: Nipple-sparing mastectomy, which may improve cosmesis, body image, and
      sexual function in comparison to non-nipple-sparing mastectomy, is increasingly
      used to treat early-stage breast cancer; however, long-term survival data are
      lacking. We evaluated survival after nipple-sparing mastectomy versus
      non-nipple-sparing mastectomy in a population-based cancer registry. Methods: We 
      conducted an observational study using the California Cancer Registry,
      considering all stage 0–III breast cancers diagnosed in California from 1988 to
      2013. We compared breast cancer-specific and overall survival time after
      nipple-sparing versus non-nipple-sparing mastectomy, using multivariable
      analysis. Results: Among 157,592 stage 0–III female breast cancer patients
      treated with unilateral mastectomy from 1988–2013, 993 (0.6 %) were reported as
      having nipple-sparing and 156,599 (99.4 %) non-nipple-sparing mastectomies;
      median follow-up was 7.9 years. The proportion of mastectomies that were
      nipple-sparing increased over time (1988, 0.2 %; 2013, 5.1 %) and with
      neighborhood socioeconomic status, and decreased with age and stage. On
      multivariable analysis, nipple-sparing mastectomy was associated with a lower
      risk of breast cancer-specific mortality compared to non-nipple-sparing
      mastectomy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.98].
      However, when restricting to diagnoses 1996 or later and adjusting for a larger
      set of covariates, risk was attenuated (HR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.52–1.42). Conclusions:
      Among California breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1988–2013, nipple-sparing 
      mastectomy was not associated with worse survival than non-nipple-sparing
      mastectomy. These results may inform the decisions of patients and doctors
      deliberating between these surgical approaches for breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Characteristics of quantitative perfusion parameters on dynamic contrast‐enhanced
      MRI in mammographically occult breast cancer.
PG  - 377-90
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics of quantitative
      perfusion parameters obtained from dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with mammographically occult (MO) breast
      cancers and those with mammographically visible (MV) breast cancers. Quantitative
      parameters (AUC, Ktrans,kep,ve,vp, and wi) from 13 MO breast cancers and 16 MV
      breast cancers were mapped after the DCE‐MRI data were acquired. Various
      prognostic factors, including axillary nodal status, estrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PR), Ki‐67, p53, E‐cadherin, and human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) were obtained in each group. Fisher's exact test was
      used to compare any differences of the various prognostic factors between the two
      groups. The Mann‐Whitney U test was applied to compare the quantitative
      parameters between these two groups. Finally, Spearman's correlation was used to 
      investigate the relationships between perfusion indices and four factors — age,
      tumor size, Ki‐67, and p53 — for each group. Although age, tumor size, and the
      prognostic factors were not statistically different between the two groups, the
      mean values of the quantitative parameters, except wi in the MV group, were
      higher than those in the MO group without statistical significance (p=0.219). The
      kep value was significantly different between the two groups (p=0.048), but the
      other parameters were not. In the MO group, vp with size, ve with p53, and Ktrans
      and vp with Ki‐67 had significant correlations (p<0.05). However, in the MV
      group, only kep showed significant correlation with age. The kep value was only
      the perfusion parameter of statistical significance between MO and MV breast
      cancers.PACS number(s): 87.19.U‐, 87.61.‐c

PG  - 534-41
AB  - Monitoring and controlling respiratory motion is a challenge for the accuracy and
      safety of therapeutic irradiation of thoracic tumors. Various commercial systems 
      based on the monitoring of internal or external surrogates have been developed
      but remain costly. In this article we describe and validate Madibreast, an
      in‐house‐made respiratory monitoring and processing device based on optical
      tracking of external markers. We designed an optical apparatus to ensure
      real‐time submillimetric image resolution at 4 m. Using OpenCv libraries, we
      optically tracked high‐contrast markers set on patients' breasts. Validation of
      spatial and time accuracy was performed on a mechanical phantom and on human
      breast. Madibreast was able to track motion of markers up to a 5 cm/s speed, at a
      frame rate of 30 fps, with submillimetric accuracy on mechanical phantom and
      human breasts. Latency was below 100 ms. Concomitant monitoring of three
      different locations on the breast showed discrepancies in axial motion up to 4 mm
      for deep‐breathing patterns. This low‐cost, computer‐vision system for real‐time 
      motion monitoring of the irradiation of breast cancer patients showed
      submillimetric accuracy and acceptable latency. It allowed the authors to
      highlight differences in surface motion that may be correlated to tumor
      motion.PACS number(s): 87.55.km

TI  - Surface imaging, laser positioning or volumetric imaging for breast cancer with
      nodal involvement treated by helical TomoTherapy.
PG  - 200-11
AB  - A surface imaging system, Catalyst (C‐Rad), was compared with laser‐based
      positioning and daily mega voltage computed tomography (MVCT) setup for breast
      patients with nodal involvement treated by helical TomoTherapy. Catalyst‐based
      positioning performed better than laser‐based positioning. The respective
      modalities resulted in a standard deviation (SD), 68% confidence interval (CI) of
      positioning of left–right, craniocaudal, anterior–posterior, roll: 2.4 mm, 2.7
      mm, 2.4 mm, 0.9° for Catalyst positioning, and 6.1 mm, 3.8 mm, 4.9 mm, 1.1° for
      laser‐based positioning, respectively. MVCT‐based precision is a combination of
      the interoperator variability for MVCT fusion and the patient movement during the
      time it takes for MVCT and fusion. The MVCT fusion interoperator variability for 
      breast patients was evaluated at one SD left–right, craniocaudal, ant–post, roll 
      as: 1.4 mm, 1.8 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.0°.There was no statistically significant
      difference between the automatic MVCT registration result and the manual
      adjustment; the automatic fusion results were within the 95% CI of the mean
      result of 10 users, except for one specific case where the patient was positioned
      with large yaw. We found that users add variability to the roll correction as the
      automatic registration was more consistent.The patient position uncertainty
      confidence interval was evaluated as 1.9 mm, 2.2 mm, 1.6 mm, 0.9° after 4 min,
      and 2.3 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.2 mm, 1° after 10 min. The combination of this patient
      movement with MVCT fusion interoperator variability results in total standard
      deviations of patient position when treatment starts 4 or 10 min after initial
      positioning of, respectively: 2.3 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.3° and 2.7 mm, 3.3 mm,
      2.6 mm, 1.4°.Surface based positioning arrives at the same precision when taking 
      into account the time required for MVCT imaging and fusion. These results can be 
      used on a patient‐per‐patient basis to decide which positioning system performs
      the best after the first 5 fractions and when daily MVCT can be omitted. Ideally,
      real‐time monitoring is required to reduce important intrafraction movement.PACS

TI  - Evaluation of cassette‐based digital radiography detectors using standardized
      image quality metrics: AAPM TG‐150 Draft Image Detector Tests.
PG  - 391-417
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate several of the standardized image
      quality metrics proposed by the American Association of Physics in Medicine
      (AAPM) Task Group 150. The task group suggested region‐of‐interest (ROI)‐based
      techniques to measure nonuniformity, minimum signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR), number 
      of anomalous pixels, and modulation transfer function (MTF). This study evaluated
      the effects of ROI size and layout on the image metrics by using four different
      ROI sets, assessed result uncertainty by repeating measurements, and compared
      results with two commercially available quality control tools, namely the
      Carestream DIRECTVIEW Total Quality Tool (TQT) and the GE Healthcare Quality
      Assurance Process (QAP). Seven Carestream DRX‐1C (CsI) detectors on mobile DR
      systems and four GE FlashPad detectors in radiographic rooms were tested. Images 
      were analyzed using MATLAB software that had been previously validated and
      reported. Our values for signal and SNR nonuniformity and MTF agree with values
      published by other investigators. Our results show that ROI size affects
      nonuniformity and minimum SNR measurements, but not detection of anomalous
      pixels. Exposure geometry affects all tested image metrics except for the MTF.
      TG‐150 metrics in general agree with the TQT, but agree with the QAP only for
      local and global signal nonuniformity. The difference in SNR nonuniformity and
      MTF values between the TG‐150 and QAP may be explained by differences in the
      calculation of noise and acquisition beam quality, respectively. TG‐150's SNR
      nonuniformity metrics are also more sensitive to detector nonuniformity compared 
      to the QAP. Our results suggest that fixed ROI size should be used for
      consistency because nonuniformity metrics depend on ROI size. Ideally, detector
      tests should be performed at the exact calibration position. If not feasible, a
      baseline should be established from the mean of several repeated measurements.
      Our study indicates that the TG‐150 tests can be used as an independent
      standardized procedure for detector performance assessment.PACS number(s):

TI  - Multiplexed imaging reveals heterogeneity of PI3K/MAPK network signaling in
      breast lesions of known PIK3CA genotype.
PG  - 575-83
AB  - Purpose: Activating genetic changes in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
      signaling pathway are found in over half of invasive breast cancers (IBC).
      Previously, we discovered numerous hotspot PIK3CA mutations in proliferative
      breast lesions. Here, we investigate the spatial nature of PI3K pathway signaling
      and its relationship with PI3K genotype in breast lesions. Methods: We identified
      PI3K phosphosignaling network signatures in columnar cell change (CCL), usual
      ductal hyperplasia (UDH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC in 29 lesions
      of known PIK3CA genotype from 10 human breast specimens using a
      hyperspectral-based multiplexed tissue imaging platform (MTIP) to simultaneously 
      quantitate PI3K/MAPK pathway targets (pAKT473, pAKT308, pPRAS40, pS6, and pERK)
      in FFPE tissue, with single cell resolution. Results: We found that breast
      lesional epithelia contained spatially heterogeneous patterns of PI3K pathway
      phosphoprotein signatures, even within microscopic areas of CCL, UDH, DCIS and
      IBC. Most lesions contained 3–12 unique phosphoprotein signatures within the same
      microscopic field. The dominant phosphoprotein signature for each lesion was not 
      well-correlated with lesion genotype or lesion histology, yet samples from the
      same patient tended to group together. Further, 5 UDH/CCL lesions across
      different patients had a common phosphosignature at the epithelial-stromal
      interface (possible myoepithelial cells) that was distinct from both the adjacent
      lesional epithelium, and distinct from adjacent stroma. Conclusion: We present
      the first spatial mapping of PI3K phosphoprotein networks in proliferative breast
      lesions, and demonstrate complex PI3K signaling heterogeneity that defies simple 
      correlation between PIK3CA genotype and phosphosignal pattern.

TI  - HALT-D: A Phase II Evaluation of Crofelemer for the Prevention and Prophylaxis of
      Diarrhea in Patients With Breast Cancer on Pertuzumab-Based Regimens.
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Approximately 40% to 80% of patients receiving pertuzumab-directed therapy for
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer will
      develop chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID). Loperamide and octreotide are
      frequently used to treat CID after diarrhea occurs, but neither is used
      prophylactically or targets the underlying mechanism. Previous studies suggest
      blocking epidermal growth factor receptor may cause excess chloride secretion,
      resulting in diarrhea. Crofelemer is derived from the red latex of the Croton
      lechleri tree, blocks gastrointestinal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
      and calcium-activated chloride channels, and is U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      approved for relief of diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients on anti-retroviral therapy. 
      Crofelemer is not systemically absorbed, has relatively few side effects, and
      presents a targeted approach at preventing CID in patients receiving
      pertuzumab-based therapy. HALT-D (DiarrHeA Prevention and ProphyLaxis with
      Crofelemer in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Trastuzumab,
      Pertuzumab, and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel with or without Carboplatin, NCT02910219)
      is a phase II, randomized, open-label trial that aims to recruit 46 patients from
      3 MedStar sites. Adults with HER2-positive breast cancer being treated with
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel or paclitaxel (THP) or trastuzumab,
      pertuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin (TCHP) will be randomized to receive
      crofelemer or no medication for diarrhea prophylaxis. The primary endpoint is
      incidence of all grade diarrhea for ≥ 2 consecutive days during cycles 1 to 2 of 
      THP or TCHP. Secondary endpoints include overall incidence, duration, and
      severity of diarrhea; time to onset of diarrhea; use of other anti-diarrheal
      medications; stool frequency and consistency; and quality of life. HALT-D will
      provide important information about the feasibility and tolerability of
      crofelemer in preventing diarrhea for patients receiving THP or TCHP.

TI  - Body fatness throughout the life course and the incidence of premenopausal breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1103-12
AB  - Background: The role of body fatness in the aetiology of breast cancer is
      complex. We evaluated the independent and synergistic effects of body fatness, at
      different stages throughout a woman's life course, on premenopausal breast cancer
      risk.Methods: Premenopausal participants of the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII)
      were followed from 1991 up to 2009. Body fatness factors including birthweight,
      somatotype (a 9-level pictogram with level 1 being the leanest) at ages 5 and 10 
      years and body mass index (BMI) at age 18 were collected at baseline. Current BMI
      was updated biennially. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate 
      the association between each body fatness factor as well as cross-classification 
      of all factors and the incidence of breast cancer.Results: Based on 1574 incident
      premenopausal breast cancer cases and 1 133 893 person-years of follow-up, a
      lower incidence was associated with lower birthweight: hazard ratio (HR) [95%
      confidence interval (CI)] = 0.74 (0.58–0.95) for <2.5kg vs 3.9+kg, P for trend < 
      0.001; higher somatotype at age 5: HR=0.57 (95% CI 0.44–0.73) for 5–9 vs 1, P
      fortrend < 0.0001]; and at age 10: HR=0.61 (95% CI 0.49–0.75) for 5–9 vs 1, P for
      trend < 0.0001]; and BMI at age 18: HR=0.67 (95% 0.47–0.95) for ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 vs <
      18.5 kg/m2, P for trend = 0.009], after adjusting for age and body fatness
      measures earlier in life and other risk factors, respectively. No significant
      interaction between body fatness measures was found. Women with the lowest
      birthweight, the highest somatotype at ages 5 and 10 and the highest BMI at age
      18 and currently had a 72% (95% CI 54%-83%) lower incidence of invasive
      premenopausal breast cancer than women with the opposite extreme of each body
      fatness indicator.Conclusion: The lowest incidence of premenopausal breast cancer
      was associated with the lowest birthweight and the highest childhood, adolescent 
      and early adult body fatness.

TI  - Evaluation of target and cardiac position during visually monitored deep
      inspiration breath‐hold for breast radiotherapy.
PG  - 25-36
AB  - A low‐resource visually monitored deep inspiration breath‐hold (VM‐DIBH)
      technique was successfully implemented in our clinic to reduce cardiac dose in
      left‐sided breast radiotherapy. In this study, we retrospectively characterized
      the chest wall and heart positioning accuracy of VM‐DIBH using cine portal images
      from 42 patients. Central chest wall position from field edge and in‐field
      maximum heart distance (MHD) were manually measured on cine images and compared
      to the planned positions based on the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs).
      An in‐house program was designed to measure left anterior descending artery (LAD)
      and chest wall separation on the planning DIBH CT scan with respect to
      breath‐hold level (BHL) during simulation to determine a minimum BHL for VM‐DIBH 
      eligibility. Systematic and random setup uncertainties of 3.0 mm and 2.6 mm,
      respectively, were found for VM‐DIBH treatment from the chest wall measurements. 
      Intrabeam breath‐hold stability was found to be good, with over 96% of delivered 
      fields within 3 mm. Average treatment MHD was significantly larger for those
      patients where some of the heart was planned in the field compared to patients
      whose heart was completely shielded in the plan (p < 0.001). No evidence for a
      minimum BHL was found, suggesting that all patients who can tolerate DIBH may
      yield a benefit from it.PACS number(s): 87.53.Jw, 87.53.Kn, 87.55.D‐

TI  - The Neo-Bioscore Update for Staging Breast Cancer Treated With Neoadjuvant
      Chemotherapy: Incorporation of Prognostic Biologic Factors Into Staging After
      Treatment.
PG  - 929-36
AB  - IMPORTANCE: We previously described and validated a breast cancer staging system 
      (CPS+EG, clinical-pathologic scoring system incorporating estrogen
      receptor–negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology) for assessing
      prognosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using pretreatment clinical stage,
      posttreatment pathologic stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and grade.
      Development of the CPS+EG staging system predated routine administration of
      trastuzumab in patients with ERBB2-positive disease (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu). 
      OBJECTIVE: To validate the CPS+EG staging system using the new definition of ER
      positivity (≥1%) and to develop an updated staging system (Neo-Bioscore) that
      incorporates ERBB2 status into the previously developed CPS+EG. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of data collected prospectively from
      January 2005 through December 2012 on patients with breast cancer treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Prognostic scores were computed using 2 versions of
      the CPS+EG staging system, one with ER considered positive if it measured 10% or 
      higher, the other with ER considered positive if it measured 1% or higher. Fits
      of the Cox proportional hazards model for the 2 sets of prognostic scores were
      compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Status of ERBB2 was added 
      to the model, and the likelihood ratio test was used to determine improvement in 
      fit. RESULTS: A total of 2377 patients were included; all were women (median age,
      50 years [range, 21-87 years]); ER status was less than 1% in 28.9%, 1% to 9% in 
      8.3%, and 10% or higher in 62.8%; 591 patients were ERBB2 positive. Median
      follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.5-11.7 years). Five-year disease-specific
      survival was 89% (95% CI, 87%-90%). Using 1% or higher as the cutoff for ER
      positivity, 5-year disease-specific survival estimates determined using the
      CPS+EG stage ranged from 52% to 98%, thereby validating our previous finding that
      the CPS+EG score facilitates more refined categorization into prognostic
      subgroups than clinical or final pathologic stage alone. The AIC value for this
      model was 3333.06, while for a model using 10% or higher as the cutoff for ER
      positivity, it was 3333.38, indicating that the model fits were nearly identical.
      The improvement in fit of the model when ERBB2 status was added was highly
      significant, with 5-year disease-specific survival estimates ranging from 48% to 
      99% (P < .001). Incorporating ERBB2 into the staging system defined the
      Neo-Bioscore, which provided improved stratification of patients with respect to 
      prognosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Neo-Bioscore improves our previously
      validated staging system and allows its application in ERBB2-positive patients.
      We recommend that treatment response and biologic markers be incorporated into
      the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.

TI  - Effect of Body Mass Index– and Actual Weight– Based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
      Doses on Pathologic Complete Response in Operable Breast Cancer.
PG  - 480-6
AB  - The effect of body mass index (BMI) on pathologic complete response (pCR)
      accounting for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) dose reductions remains undefined. 
      In 171 patients with operable breast cancer who received NAC, those with a BMI of
      ≥25 were less likely to tolerate uncapped taxane doses. Any chemotherapy dose
      reduction resulted in greater odds of not attaining a pCR in obese patients,
      independent of known predictors.Introduction: The effect of body mass index (BMI)
      and chemotherapy dose reduction on pathologic complete response (pCR) after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locoregional breast cancer remains unclear.
      Contemporary studies have reported largely on trial populations and used
      dose-capping. Patients and Methods: Patient registries at the University of Iowa 
      were queried to identify patients with operable breast cancer who received NAC.
      Dose reductions were calculated for taxanes (T), anthracyclines (A) and non–A-T
      chemotherapy. Clinical-pathologic characteristics, chemotherapy dose reductions, 
      and adverse events were compared between normal (BMI <25) and overweight/obese
      patients (BMI ≥25). Additionally, the synergistic effect of BMI and chemotherapy 
      dose reduction on pCR was assessed. Results: Of 171 eligible patients, 112 were
      overweight/obese. Chemotherapy dosing was capped in 2 patients; all others
      initiated full weight-based treatment. Overweight/obese patients required more
      frequent taxane (44.6% vs. 25.4%; P = .01) and any chemotherapy dose reductions
      (50.9% vs. 33.9%; P = .03). pCR was attained in 29.2% of patients. In a
      multivariable model, the interaction term for BMI as a continuous variable and
      any chemotherapy dose reduction was significant independent of the clinical stage
      and tumor receptor status (P = .04). For obese patients, any chemotherapy dose
      reduction was significantly associated with increased odds of not attaining pCR. 
      Conclusion: During NAC, overweight/obese patients more often have chemotherapy
      dose reductions. Chemotherapy dose reduction in obese patients was a powerful
      predictor of not attaining pCR. This was not seen for normal or overweight
      patients. Opportunities might exist to improve pCR rates in this higher-risk
      group.

TI  - Transcriptomic profiling of curcumin treated human breast stem cells identifies a
      role for stearoyl coa-desaturase in breast cancer prevention.
PG  - 29-41
AB  - Curcumin is a potential agent for both the prevention and treatment of cancers.
      Curcumin treatment alone, or in combination with piperine, limits breast stem
      cell self-renewal while remaining non-toxic to normal differentiated cells. We
      paired fluorescence activated cell sorting with RNA sequencing to characterize
      the genome-wide changes induced specifically in normal breast stem cells
      following treatment with these compounds. We generated genome-wide maps of the
      transcriptional changes that occur in epithelial-like (ALDH+) and
      mesenchymal-like (ALDH−/CD44+/CD24−) normal breast stem/progenitor cells
      following treatment with curcumin and piperine. We show that curcumin targets
      both stem cell populations by down-regulating expression of breast stem cell
      genes including ALDH1A3, CD49f, PROM1, and TP63. We also identified novel genes
      and pathways targeted by curcumin, including downregulation of SCD. Transient
      siRNA knockdown of SCD in MCF10A cells significantly inhibited mammosphere
      formation and the mean proportion of CD44+/CD24− cells, suggesting that SCD is a 
      regulator of breast stemness and a target of curcumin in breast stem cells. These
      findings extend previous reports of curcumin targeting stem cells, here in two
      phenotypically distinct stem/progenitor populations isolated from normal human
      breast tissue. We identified novel mechanisms by which curcumin and piperine
      target breast stem cell self-renewal, such as by targeting lipid metabolism,
      providing a mechanistic link between curcumin treatment and stem cell self
      renewal. These results elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin may act as a
      cancer preventive compound and provide novel targets for cancer prevention and
      treatment.

TI  - Breast Cancer Screening Among Women with Medicaid, 2006–2008: a Multilevel
      Analysis.
PG  - 446-54
AB  - Introduction: Nationally, about one third of women with breast cancer (BC) are
      diagnosed at late stage, which might be reduced with greater utilization of BC
      screening. The purpose of this paper is to examine the predictors of BC
      mammography use among women with Medicaid, and differences among Medicaid
      beneficiaries in their propensity to use mammography. Methods: The sample
      included 2,450,527 women drawn from both fee-for-service and managed care
      Medicaid claims from 25 states, during 2006–2008. The authors used multilevel
      modeling of predictors at person, county, and state levels of influence and
      examined traditional factors affecting access and the expanded scope of practice 
      allowed for the nurse practitioner (NP) in some states to provide primary care
      independent of physician oversight. Results: Black [OR = 0.87; 95 % CI
      (0.87–0.88)] and American Indian women [OR = 0.74; 95 % CI (0.71–0.76)] had lower
      odds ratio of mammography use than white women, while Hispanic [OR = 1.06; 95 %
      CI (1.05–1.07)] had higher odds ratio of mammography use than white women. Living
      in counties with higher Hispanic residential segregation [OR = 1.16; 95 % CI
      (1.10–1.23)] was associated with a higher odds ratio of mammography use compared 
      to areas with low Hispanic residential segregation, whereas living among more
      segregated black [OR = 0.78; 95 % CI (0.75–0.81)] or Asian [OR = 0.19; 95 % CI
      (0.17–0.21)] communities had lower odds ratio compared to areas with low
      segregation. Holding constant statistically the perceived shortage of MDs, which 
      was associated with significantly lower mammography use, the NP regulatory
      variable [OR = 1.03; 95 % CI (1.01–1.07)] enhanced the odds ratio of mammography 
      use among women in the six states with expanded scope of practice, compared with 
      women residing in 19 more restrictive states. Conclusions: Racial and ethnic
      disparities exist in the use of mammography among Medicaid-insured women. More
      expansive NP practice privileges in states are associated with higher
      utilization, and may help reduce rural disparities.

TI  - Protective Effect of Aerobic Physical Activity on Sleep Behavior in Breast Cancer
      Survivors.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Hypotheses. Sleep disorders are associated with an increased risk of cancer,
      including breast cancer (BC). Physical activity (PA) can produce beneficial
      effects on sleep. Study design. We designed a randomized controlled trial to test
      the effect of 3 months of physical activity on sleep and circadian rhythm
      activity level evaluated by actigraphy. Methods. 40 BC women, aged 35-70 years,
      were randomized into an intervention (IG) and a control group (CG). IG performed 
      a 3 month of aerobic exercise. At baseline and after 3 months, the following
      parameters were evaluated both for IG and CG: anthropometric and body composition
      measurements, energy expenditure and motion level; sleep parameters (Actual Sleep
      Time-AST, Actual Wake Time-AWT, Sleep Efficiency-SE, Sleep Latency-SL, Mean
      Activity Score-MAS, Movement and Fragmentation Index-MFI and Immobility Time-IT) 
      and activity level circadian rhythm using the Actigraph Actiwatch. Results. The
      CG showed a deterioration of sleep, whereas the IG showed a stable pattern. In
      the CG the SE, AST and IT decreased and the AWT, SL, MAS and MFI increased. In
      the IG, the SE, IT, AWT, SL, and MAS showed no changes and AST and MFI showed a
      less pronounced change in the IG than in the CG. The rhythmometric analysis
      revealed a significant circadian rhythm in two groups. After 3 months of PA, IG
      showed reduced fat mass %, while CG had improved weight and BMI. Conclusion.
      Physical activity may be beneficial against sleep disruption. Indeed, PA
      prevented sleep worsening in IG. PA can represent an integrative intervention
      therapy able to modify sleep behaviour.

TI  - Effects of a Community-Based Multimodal Exercise Program on Health-Related
      Physical Fitness and Physical Function in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 446-54
AB  - Purpose. Breast cancer and oncological treatment can result in significant acute 
      and late localized and systemic negative effects on health-related physical
      fitness and physical function. The aim of this single-arm study was to examine
      the effects of a 12-week community-based multimodal exercise program on
      health-related physical fitness and physical function in breast cancer survivors.
      Methods. A total of 52 female breast cancer survivors (mean age = 59.7 ± 10.4
      years) completed supervised exercise training consisting of (1) aerobic
      conditioning, (2) resistance training, and (3) balance and flexibility training, 
      for 30 minutes each, totaling 90 minutes twice weekly for 12 weeks. Pretreatment 
      and posttreatment outcome measures—mobility: (1) Timed Up and Go (TUG) and (2)
      6-minute walk test (6MWT); muscular strength: (3) leg press strength and (4)
      chest press strength; upper-extremity flexibility: (5) back scratch test; and
      balance: (6) functional reach (FR) and (7) single-leg stance time—were assessed
      and compared. Results. Postintervention assessment measures given as percentage
      improvement and effect size (ES) for mobility, TUG (18%, 0.59), and 6MWT (14%,
      0.74) were significantly (P < .001) improved. Outcome measures of muscular
      strength, leg press strength (32%, 0.58) and chest press strength (40%, 0.61),
      both significantly (P < .001) improved. Postintervention assessment measure of
      upper-extremity flexibility (42%, 0.41) showed significant (P < .001)
      improvements. Outcome measures for balance, FR (18%, 0.75) and single leg stance 
      time (24%, 0.30), showed significant (P < .001) improvements. Conclusions.
      Outcome measures showed moderate to large ES improvements after participants
      completed the 12-week multimodal exercise program for breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Initial Surgery and Survival in Stage IV Breast Cancer in the United States,
      1988–2011.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Management of the primary tumor site in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the patterns of
      receipt of initial breast surgery for female patients with stage IV breast cancer
      in the United States, with particular attention to women who survived at least 10
      years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study using data
      from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Female
      patients diagnosed as having stage IV breast cancer between 1988 and 2011 and who
      did not receive radiation therapy as part of the first course of treatment were
      included (N = 21 372). Kaplan-Meier estimates of median survival and descriptive 
      statistics were used to compare patient and tumor characteristics by receipt of
      breast surgery at diagnosis. A Royston-Parmar survival model and logistic
      regression analysis assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with
      survival and prolonged survival (of at least 10 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURES: Differences in survival, particularly survival of at least 10 years, by
      receipt of initial surgery to the primary tumor. RESULTS: Among the 21 372
      patients, the median survival increased from 20 months (1988–1991) to 26 months
      (2007–2011). During this time, the rate of surgery declined (odds ratio [OR],
      0.16; 95% CI, 0.12–0.21). Even so, receipt of surgery was associated with
      improved survival in multivariate analysis, which controlled for patient and
      clinical characteristics, along with time period (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI,
      0.57–0.63). For women diagnosed as having cancer before 2002 (n = 7504), survival
      of at least 10 years was seen in 9.6%(n = 353) and 2.9% (n = 107) of those who
      did and did not receive surgery, respectively (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.89–4.50). In
      multivariate analysis, survival of at least 10 years was associated with receipt 
      of surgery (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.08–3.77), hormone receptor–positive
      disease (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.25–2.48), older age (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32–0.54),
      larger tumor size (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.27–0.51), marital status of being
      separated at the time of diagnosis (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.88), and more recent
      year of diagnosis (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02–1.99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      Survival in stage IV breast cancer has improved and is increasingly of prolonged 
      duration, particularly for some women undergoing initial breast surgery. As
      systemic therapy advances provide better control of distant disease in stage IV
      breast cancer, and as women present with lower distant disease burdens, these
      findings on initial surgery to the primary tumor may be of importance.

TI  - Relationship Between Breast Density and Selective Estrogen-Receptor Modulators,
      Aromatase Inhibitors, Physical Activity, and Diet: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 127-44
AB  - Background. Lower breast density (BD) is associated with lower risk of breast
      cancer and may serve as a biomarker for the efficacy of chemopreventive
      strategies. This review explores parameters that are thought to be associated
      with lower BD. We conducted a systematic review of articles published to date
      using the PRISMA strategy. Articles that assessed change in BD with
      estrogen-receptor modulators (tamoxifene [TAM], raloxifene [RLX], and tibolone)
      and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal
      studies (LSs) that assessed association between BD and physical activity (PA) or 
      diet were reviewed. Results. Ten studies assessed change in BD with TAM; all
      reported TAM-mediated BD decreases. Change in BD with RLX was assessed by 11
      studies; 3 reported a reduction in BD. Effect of tibolone was assessed by 5 RCTs;
      only 1 reported change in BD. AI-mediated BD reduction was reported by 3 out of
      10 studies. The association between PA and BD was assessed by 21 studies; 4
      reported an inverse association. The relationship between diet and BD was
      assessed in 34 studies. All studies on calcium and vitamin D as well as vegetable
      intake reported an inverse association with BD in premenopausal women. Two RCTs
      demonstrated BD reduction with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate intervention.
      Conclusion. TAM induces BD reduction; however, the effect of RLX, tibolone, and
      AIs on BD is unclear. Although data on association between diet and BD in
      adulthood are contradictory, intake of vegetables, vitamin D, and calcium appear 
      to be associated with lower BD in premenopausal women.

      biopsy under intracardiac echocardiography guidance.
LID - bcr2016215146
AB  - Precise diagnosis of intracardiac masses is fundamental to their treatment.
      However, the findings of non-invasive imaging techniques are frequently
      inconclusive. In this setting, percutaneous transcatheter biopsy might represent 
      a valid alternative to surgical biopsy. Intracardiac echocardiography
      (ICE)-guided biopsy offers high-quality imaging, is a relatively quick and easy
      interventional procedure to perform and does not require patient intubation or
      the assistance of an echocardiographer. We describe the case of a 47-year-old
      woman undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, who presented with a right
      atrial mass. Non-invasive imaging was inconclusive. Since no changes in the
      aspect or size of the mass were noticed after 2-week treatment with heparin,
      ICE-guided biopsy was performed, which confirmed the thrombotic nature of the
      mass. The patient underwent surgical resection of the thrombus and curative
      treatment of her breast cancer was pursued.

AB  - Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a relatively rare and aggressive subtype,
      accounting for nearly 2.5% of all diagnosed breast cancers worldwide. It is
      usually characterised by an acute onset, rapid clinical progression, poor
      prognosis and micrometastasis at the time of presentation. Prompt recognition of 
      clinical symptoms and identification of warning signs are vital in diagnosing and

TI  - Mammography Use Among Medicare Beneficiaries After Elimination of Cost Sharing.
PG  - 394-9
AB  - Background: We examined mammography use before and after Medicare eliminated cost
      sharing for screening mammography in January 2011. Methods: Using National Health
      Interview Survey data, we examined changes in mammography use between 2010 and
      2013 among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–74 years. Logistic regression and
      predictive margins were used to examine changes in use after adjusting for
      covariates. Results: In 2013, 74.7% of women reported a mammogram within 2 years,
      a 3.5 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, −0.3, 7.2) compared
      with 2010. Increases occurred among women aged 65–69 years, unmarried women, and 
      women with usual sources of care and 2–5 physician visits in the prior year.
      After adjustment, mammography use increased in 2013 versus 2010 (74.8% vs. 71.3%,
      P = 0.039). Interactions between year and income, insurance, race, or ethnicity
      were not significant. Conclusions: There was a modest increase in mammography use
      from 2010 to 2013 among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–74 years, possibly
      consistent with an effect of eliminating Medicare cost sharing during this time. 
      Findings suggest that eliminating cost sharing might increase use of recommended 
      screening services.

LID - bcr2016214349
AB  - A 68-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presented with skin lesions
      and sternal pain. Clinical examination revealed ulcerative lesions on mastectomy 
      scar and CT scan showed contiguous sternal osteolysis. The main hypothesis was a 
      breast cancer recurrence; however, cutaneous and bone biopsies did not reveal any
      cancer cells. Skin tissue culture detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting
      ecthyma gangrenosum despite the absence of bacteraemia in our patient and despite
      her immunocompetence. Surgical treatment was performed, followed by a long course
      of antibiotherapy.

TI  - A novel method for radiotherapy patient identification using surface imaging.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - Performing a procedure on the wrong patient or site is one of the greatest errors
      that can occur in medicine. The addition of automation has been shown to reduce
      errors in many processes. In this work we explore the use of an automated patient
      identification process using optical surface imaging for radiotherapy treatments.
      Surface imaging uses visible light to align the patient to a reference surface in
      the treatment room. It is possible to evaluate the similarity between a daily
      set‐up surface image and the reference image using distance to agreement between 
      the points on the two surfaces. The higher the percentage overlapping points
      within a defined distance, the more similar the surfaces. This similarity metric 
      was used to intercompare 16 left‐sided breast patients. The reference surface for
      each patient was compared to 10 daily treatment surfaces for the same patient,
      and 10 surfaces from each of the other 15 patients (for a total of 160
      comparisons per patient), looking at the percent of points overlapping. For each 
      patient, the minimum same‐patient similarity score was higher than the maximum
      different‐patient score. For the group as a whole a threshold was able to
      classify correct and incorrect patients with high levels of accuracy. A 10‐fold
      cross‐validation using linear discriminant analysis gave cross‐validation loss of
      0.0074. An automated process using surface imaging is a feasible option to
      provide nonharmful daily patient identification verification using currently
      available technology.PACS number(s): 87.53.Jw, 87.55.N‐, 87.55.Qr, 87.57.N‐,

TI  - Prognostic Value of Circulating Tumor Cells Identified prior to Surgical
      Resection in Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be identified in approximately 25%
      of non-metastatic breast cancer patients (BC), and data are emerging regarding
      their prognostic significance. We hypothesized that CTCs identified prior to
      resection of the primary tumor would predict worse outcome in non-metastatic BC
      patients. Study Design: We performed CTC enumerations on 509 patients with
      non-metastatic BC as part of an IRB approved study. CTCs (per 7.5 ml blood) were 
      identified using the Cell Search® System (Janssen). The presence of ≥ 1 CTC
      meeting morphological criteria for malignancy was considered a positive result.
      Log-rank test and Cox regression analysis were applied to establish the
      association of CTCs with relapse-free and overall survival. Results: Median
      follow-up was 48 months and mean age was 53 years. Fifty-nine percent of patients
      (299/509) had tumors >2cm, and 46% (234/509) had positive lymph nodes. One
      hundred sixty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to CTC 
      assessment, and 343 patients were chemonaïve. One or more CTC was identified in
      43/166 (26%) of NACT treated patients, and in 81/343 (24%) of chemonaïve
      patients. CTCs were not associated with tumor size, grade, or lymph node status
      (P= NS). Detection of one or more CTCs predicted decreased relapse-free (log-rank
      P<0.001, HR = 2.72, 95% CI, 1.57 to 4.72; P<0.001) and overall survival (log-rank
      P=0.02, HR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.67; P = 0.03) at 48 months of follow-up.
      Conclusions: One or more CTCs identified prior to resection of the primary breast
      tumor predicted worse relapse-free and overall survival, irrespective of primary 
      tumor size, grade, or lymph node positivity.

TI  - Radiographically occult intrasinusoidal liver metastases leading to hepatic
      failure in a case of breast cancer.
LID - bcr2015214120
AB  - The liver is one of the commonest sites of metastatic involvement in breast
      cancer, usually evident as focal lesions on imaging tests. Rarely, the pattern of
      metastatic spread is so diffuse that it remains radiologically occult. Such
      patients usually present with signs of hepatic insufficiency without any focal
      lesions on liver imaging. In such cases, liver biopsy is required to make a
      definitive diagnosis. We report a case of a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman with
      metastatic breast cancer who presented with subacute progressive liver failure.
      Repeated imaging of the liver was normal or non-descript. Liver biopsy finally
      established the diagnosis of intrasinusoidal metastases from breast cancer.
