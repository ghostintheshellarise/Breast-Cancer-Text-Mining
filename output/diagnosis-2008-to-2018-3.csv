breast cancer biology and treatment  These assays\nhave traditionally been performed by analysis of cell culture or tissue\nsamples  More recently  functional and molecular imaging has\nallowed the in vivo assay of biochemistry and molecular biology \nwhich is highly complementary to tissue-based assays  This review\nbriefly describes different imaging modalities used in molecular\nimaging and then reviews applications of molecular imaging to\nbreast cancer  with a focus on translational work  It includes\nsections describing work in functional and physiological tumor\nimaging  imaging gene product expression  imaging the tumor\nmicroenvironment  reporter gene imaging  and cell labeling  Work in\nboth animal models and human is discussed with an eye towards\nstudies that have relevance to breast cancer treatment in patients \n\nIntroduction\nThe ability to assay cancer biological features is key to\nadvances in both the basic and clinical science of breast\ncancer  Advances in our ability to assay molecular processes \nincluding gene expression  protein expression  and molecular\nand cellular biochemistry  have fueled recent advances in our\nunderstanding of breast cancer biology and our ability to treat\nbreast cancer in patients  Most assays require sampling of\ncells or tissues to perform the measurements  Thus  the cell\nculture system  animal model  or patient must be perturbed in\norder to perform the assay  This requirement makes serial\nassays over time more difficult and leaves open the possibility\nthat the assay itself may change the state of the system being\nmeasured  The ability to measure biological processes\nwithout perturbing them would be highly desirable and would\noffer complementary information to that obtained by most\ntraditional assay methods \n\nAdvances in both technology and cancer science have led to\nthe ability to perform non-invasive molecular assays  An\nexample is the use of reporter genes whose expression\nresults in the production of material such as green\n\nfluorescent protein or luciferase that can be detected without\ntissue sampling [1]  Another advance  applicable to the entire\nrange of biological systems from cell culture to human  is\nmolecular imaging [2 3]  which is the focus of this review \n\nImaging has traditionally relied on structural and anatomic\nfeatures to detect breast cancer and determine its extent [4] \nThis traditional form of imaging  often termed anatomic\nimaging  has made an important contribution to cancer care \nand is widely used in the detection and staging of breast\ncancer patients using methods such as X-ray mammography\nand computed tomography  CT  More recently  imaging has\nexpanded to include the ability to image regional biochemistry\nand molecular biology  often termed molecular imaging [2] \nThe focus for molecular imaging is not structure  but rather\nregional biology  Quantitative analysis is an important feature\nof this type of imaging  for example  the ability to measure\nregional tumor receptor expression [5 6]  As such  molecular\nimaging can be considered an in vivo assay technique \ncapable of measuring regional tumor biology without perturb-\ning it  This makes molecular imaging a unique tool for probing\nbreast cancer biology  complementary to traditional assay\nmethods  and a potentially very powerful tool for translational\nscience  In the sections that follow  imaging methods used in\nmolecular imaging are reviewed  the biological processes that\ncan be assayed are discussed  and selected examples of\ntranslational science using molecular imaging are reviewed \nThe focus is on in vivo imaging of animal models and patients \n\nIt is important to keep in perspective inherent differences in\ncapabilities between tissue-based assays and in vivo assays\nusing molecular imaging  Imaging is non-invasive and \ntherefore  better suited to serial assay  In addition  imaging\ntypically surveys the entire animal or patient and  therefore \navoids sampling errors that can occur for assays that require\ntissue sampling  especially when there is significant tumor\nheterogeneity  However

Suppl 1 Mankoff\n\nassay many different processes at once - for example  the\nexpression of an array of genes [7] - imaging can typically\nsample at most a few processes at the same time  Also  while\nit is possible to ‘batch’ process for many samples at the same\ntime  imaging needs to be performed one subject at a time \nFurthermore  the need for sophisticated equipment and\nimaging probes makes imaging typically more expensive than\nsample-based assays  These last two factors limit the number\nof subjects that can be studied by imaging compared to\nsample assays  In general  imaging methods are comple-\nmentary to assay-based methods and best used to explore\nbreast cancer biology in intact animal models or patients  or\nto image the effects of therapeutic intervention on in vivo\ntumor biology \n\nImaging modalities\nThe imaging modalities most commonly used in molecular\nimaging are listed in Table 1  Common among these modali-\nties is the ability to image functional and molecular tissue\nproperties such as perfusion  metabolism  and receptor or\noncogene expression [5 8-12]  This section provides a brief\ndescription of each modality  along with its advantages and\ndisadvantages \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMagnetic resonance  MR  relies upon the interaction of\natomic nuclei with radiofrequency signals in the presence of\nstrong magnetic fields  MR imaging  MRI  offers high spatial\nresolution and functional contrast agents using magnetic\nelements such as Gd and Fe [10]  Breast MRI using non-\n\nspecific contrast agents such ad Gd-DTPA has become an\nimportant part of clinical breast cancer [13]  and there have\nbeen some notable recent successes in the use of breast\nMRI for breast cancer detection [14]  More detailed and\nquantitative approaches to dynamic contrast enhanced\n DCE  breast MRI have been increasingly used to examine\ntumor perfusion and capillary permeability as an indicator of\ntumor angiogenesis [15-17]  More specific and targeted MRI\nagents have also been developed and undergone preliminary\ntesting [18]  however  the range of possible molecular agents\nis somewhat constrained by the need to include a\nmagnetically active atom such as Gd or Fe  Recent advances\nin pulse sequences and image acquisition have led to the\nability to measure other tissue properties  such as water\ndiffusion  that can provide information on cellularity and\ninterstitial transport without the need for contrast [19 20]  An\nadvantage of MRI is its high spatial resolution and image\nquality  especially with increasing magnetic field strength \nmaking it applicable to both small animals and patient\nimaging  Limitations include the cost of the imaging system\nand the thus far somewhat limited range of imaging probes\nthat serve as MR contrast agents  although new approaches\ntested in pre-clinical models will provide increased capabili-\nties for animal research and may be able to be translated to\npatient studies [18] \n\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy\nMR spectroscopy  MRS  takes advantage of the ability of\nnuclear magnetic resonance to identify specific chemical\nsignatures and measures the regional concentrations of bio-\n\nTable 1\n\nFunctional and molecular imaging methods\n\nModality Advantages Disadvantages\n\nMagnetic resonance\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging  MRI  High spatial

possible relatively superficial sites\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nchemical species  using methods similar to those developed\nfor basic chemical assays [9]  Much of current work in\npatients uses hydrogen spectroscopy  however  spectroscopy\nfor other biologically relevant nuclei  such as phosphorus or\nsodium  is also possible [21]  MRS can quantify the\nconcentration of prevalent biochemical species without\nperturbing the system being imaged  and without the need for\nimaging contrast administration  MRS has considerably more\nlimited spatial resolution compared to MRI  however  recent\nadvances in magnetic field strength and MRS technology\nhave yielded the ability to generate three-dimensional MRS\nconcentration maps  MRS images  MRSI  with resolution on\nthe order of 1 cm or less [9]  Recent studies suggest that\nchanges in local metabolites with therapy may provide a very\nearly indicator of breast cancer response [22]  MRS has the\nadvantage of being able to directly quantify molecular species\nwithout the need for contrast  with the disadvantages of more\nlimited spatial resolution and the need for relatively high\nabundance to be able to reliably quantify regional bio-\nchemical concentration  It shares the need for relatively\nexpensive equipment with MRI  and in fact  requires fairly high\nfield strength  typically 3T or more  to be effective for animal\nand patient breast studies [9] \n\nRadionuclide imaging\nRadionuclide imaging relies on the use of imaging probes \ntypically termed radiopharmaceuticals  tagged with radio-\nactive nuclei [5]  Position-sensitive radiation detectors identify\nemitted photons and generate images of regional\nradiopharmaceutical concentration  This imaging approach \nsometimes called nuclear medicine  has traditionally relied on\ngamma-emitters such as 99mTc or 131I to form images in a\ntechnique often termed single-photon computed tomography\n SPECT  Somewhat more recently  advances in both\ninstrumentation and radiochemistry have led to the ability to\nimage positron-emitting nuclei  such as 11C and 18F  in a wide\nrange of molecules in an approach known as positron\nemission tomography  PET  [23]  Compared to SPECT  PET\noffers the potential for better spatial resolution  more accurate\nimage quantification  and a wider range of possible imaging\nprobes  however  both PET and SPECT have made notable\ncontributions to breast cancer clinical care and research\n[5 23 24]  The chief advantage of radionuclide imaging is the\nability to measure probe concentrations in the nanomolar  and\neven picomolar  range  leading to the ability to measure even\nthe most sensitive molecular processes without perturbing\nthem  A wide range of radiopharmaceuticals has been\ndeveloped to image diverse aspects of breast cancer biology\n[25]  Disadvantages include more limited spatial resolution\nand the need to produce and distribute relatively short-lived\nimaging probes  Recent development in dedicated imaging\ndevices for small animals [26] and breast-specific imaging\n[27] has overcome some of the limitations in spatial\nresolution  however  inherent spatial resolution is less than for\nother methods such as CT or MRI  The combination of PET or\nSPECT with X-ray CT  PET/CT or SPECT/CT  yields co-\n\nregistered molecular and anatomic images and the\nopportunity to image molecular biology and anatomy\nsimultaneously [28]  Radionuclide imaging probes and\ninstrumentation are relatively expensive  with costs\ncomparable to MRI \n\nOptical imaging\nOne of the oldest forms of imaging is optical imaging  using\nvisible light to generate images  In many ways optical imaging\nis the earliest form of cancer imaging  in the form of light\nmicroscopy  Recent advances in instrumentation  computa-\ntional algorithms  and imaging probes have led to new\ncapabilities in optical imaging of living organisms  including\nsmall animal models and patients [29]  A variety of optical\nmethods have been developed that can yield in vivo images\nwith high contrast  and  in some cases  considerable detail \ndown to the microscopic level  Methods can measure\nregional biology such as vascularity and blood volume using\ninherent tissue optical properties [29]  or take advantage of\nan ever increasing array of optical probes to image specific\nmolecular processes [30]  Low cost  portability  ease of use \nand wide availability of imaging probes are key advantages of\noptical imaging  Its chief disadvantage is relatively limited\ntissue penetration  Thus  while optical imaging has become\nan essential tool for breast cancer animal research [31]  its\nuse in patients has been more limited  While promising early\nstudies in breast tumor imaging point towards future clinical\napplication [29]  optical imaging has been mostly confined\nthus far to the pre-clinical setting  where it is an important tool\nfor breast cancer research \n\nUltrasound\nUltrasound imaging works by using acoustical transducers to\nsend and receive ultrasound frequency energy and generate\nthree-dimensional images from either reflection or through-\ntransmission [8]  Conventional ultrasound provides high-\nresolution anatomic detail  and breast ultrasound plays an\nimportant role in breast cancer diagnosis [32]  Doppler\ntechnology also provides information on tumor vascularity \nand with the advent of microbubble contrast agents  tumor\nperfusion [33]  Recent advances in imaging technology [34]\nand the development of targeted microbubble contrast\nagents hold promise for molecular imaging [33]  The\nportability and relatively low cost of ultrasound make it an\nideal tool for both animal and patient imaging  and the ability\nto measure molecular processes will make ultrasound a\nvaluable tool for breast cancer research  Disadvantages\ninclude some operator dependence in image acquisition and\ninterpretation  and some challenges in developing molecularly\ntargeted micobubble contrast agents \n\nOther imaging modalities such as X-ray radiography and\nX-ray CT play an important role in structural imaging  but are\nmore limited for molecular imaging  Dynamic contrast CT can\nbe used to measure tissue perfusion  similar to DCE-MRI \nwith the disadvantage of relatively high radiation exposure \n\nAvailable online http //breast-cancer-research com/content/10/S1/S3\n\n\n\nOther techniques are also being investigated [35]  but are at\nrelatively early stages of development and not discussed in\ndetail here \n\nImaging assays  what can be measured \nMolecular and functional imaging that can measure a range of\ncancer biological features have been developed and validated \nThese capabilities are reviewed in this section  broadly\ndividing categories of imaging assays into functional/physio-\nlogical properties  protein expression  with an emphasis on\ntumor receptors  the tumor microenvironment  and tumor\ngene expression  Both applications to animal models [36]\nand patients [23] are reviewed \n\nFunctional physiological tumor properties\nImaging is ideally suited to measuring in vivo tumor biology\nrelated to basic physiological properties such as perfusion \nmetabolism  biosynthesis  cell proliferation  and cell death  In\nfact  many of these processes are difficult to assay by tissue\nsampling  therefore  imaging provides a unique and quantitative\nmeasure of these properties that can only be measured in vivo \n\nTumor perfusion is one of the earliest physiological properties\nto be measured  and advances in methodology have led to\nincreasingly quantitative approaches  The most physiologi-\ncally robust and quantitative measures of tumor blood flow\nuse freely diffusible imaging probes  where blood flow can be\ninferred from the time course of probe uptake and washout \nadapting methods developed for measuring cerebral blood\nflow [37]  One example is the use of 15O-water to measure\ntumor blood flow by PET  which yields measures of tumor\nblood flow in ml/minute/g that have been validated against\nmicrosphere methods [38]  Water PET imaging has been\nshown to be effective in monitoring breast cancer response \nand changes in tumor perfusion with treatment measured by\nwater PET are predictive of survival [39]  Diffusable optical\nprobes may also be used for this purpose [29]  Considerable\neffort has been devoted to the quantification of tumor\nperfusion and tumor capillary permeability using radiographic\nand MRI contrast agents [40-44]  These agents have some-\nwhat limited permeability across capillaries  therefore  their in\nvivo kinetics are dependent upon both blood flow and\ncapillary permeability  Increasingly sophisticated image\nacquisition and analysis methods  for DCE-MRI in particular \nhave led to the ability to measure regional breast cancer\nperfusion and capillary permeability in both animal models\nand patients [17]  Novel MRI contrast agents  including\nmacromolecular agents  may offer additional capabilities [45] \nThese methods have been applied in early trials of anti-\nangiogenic therapy breast cancer and have yielded insights\ninto the nature of response [16]  Standardized methods for\nDCE-MRI for clinical trials have been proposed [46] \n\nTumor perfusion imaging requires good vascular access for\nprompt and reliable delivery of the imaging probe  and has\ntherefore been more challenging in animal models  however \n\nrecent work using inhaled radionuclide agents hold promise\nfor small animal research applications [47] \n\nTumor metabolism has also been widely studied by imaging \nPerhaps the best known example is the measurement of\nregional glucose metabolism using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\n FDG  PET  which is now routinely used in breast cancer\nclinical practice to determine the extent of tumor spread and\nassess response to treatment [5 25]  This method can also\nbe readily applied to animal models [48]  and can yield\ndetailed physiological information through kinetic analysis of\ndynamic images [49 50]  Other PET radiopharmaceuticals\ncan be used to measure other aspects of metabolism  inclu-\nding regional oxygen consumption and fatty acid metabolism\n[25]  MRS has also been quite useful in measuring\nmetabolism through 1H spectroscopy to measure levels of\nlactate and other biochemical species key in metabolism [51]\nand also through phosphorous spectroscopy to measure\nconcentrations of adenine nucleotides as an indicator of\nenergy metabolism [52]  Other studies in a variety of tumors \nespecially in brain tumors and prostate cancer  have shown\nthe ability to measure biochemical species in a variety of\nmetabolic pathways - for example  membrane lipids  choline \nand metabolic intermediates  citrate  - and have provided\nimproved diagnosis  early measures of response  and insights\ninto pathophysiology [53-58]  The chemical composition of\nthe breast  particularly its high lipid content  provides some\nchallenges for MRS  but recent progress in magnet field\nstrength  acquisition  and processing methods may offer\nimproved capabilities in breast cancer [59] \n\nAberrant cellular proliferation is a fundamental property of\ncancer  including breast cancer [60]  Labeled compounds\nsuch as 14C- or 3H-thmyidine have been an important method\nfor measuring cellular proliferation through sampling  dating\nback over 40 years [61]  Early work used PET and 11C-\nthymidine to measure tumor proliferation by imaging  and\nquantitative imaging approaches were validated against in\nvitro assay gold standards [62]  However  the short half-life of\n11C  20 minutes  and the extensive in vivo metabolism of\nthymidine limit the feasibility of this approach for both animal\nand patient imaging  More recent work using thymidine\nanalogs labeled with 18F  half-life 109 minutes  have been\ndeveloped and undergone considerable advances in recent\nyears [63 64]  The most promising of these had been 18F-\nfluorothymidine  FLT  with notable recent results in both\nanimal and patient breast cancer imaging [65-68]  FLT PET\nappears especially promising for measuring the early effects\nof therapy on breast cancer growth  as suggested by recent\nstudies by Kenny and colleagues [66]  This imaging approach\nhad also been validated against in vitro assay of proliferation\n reviewed in [63]  and is poised for greater use in both animal\nresearch and human clinical trials \n\nMethods for imaging cell death have also been investigated \nbut are at an earlier stage of development  Many of these\n\nBreast Cancer Research    Vol 10 Suppl 1 Mankoff\n\nPage 4 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\n\n\nhave been based upon an extension of Annexin V staining in\nvitro  which indicates apoptotic cells through binding to\nphosphotidyl serines [69]  The molecules are found only on\nthe inner surface of plasma membranes and  therefore \nnormally not accessible to Annexin V  a peptide  for binding \nHowever  during apoptosis  these molecules are transiently\nexposed to the extracellular space  allowing binding of\nAnnexin [69]  The earliest studies used 99mTc-annexin and\nSPECT imaging to measure apoptosis in animal models and\npatients [69 70]  More recently  methods for annexin-based\napoptosis imaging have been developed for PET  MRI  optical\nimaging  and ultrasound [71]  One limitation of this approach\nhas been the transient nature of phosphatidyl serine exposure\nduring cell death  resulting in fairly limited signal for imaging\n[72]  Other approaches targeted to other aspects of the\napoptotic cascade are being investigated [71]  An alternative \nbut less specific approach has been to use MRI measures of\nwater diffusion through the extracellular space as an indirect\nmeasure of tumor cellularity [19 73]  Increases in the diffusion\ncoefficient  as an indicator of a decrease in tumor cellularity \nhave correlated with measures of apoptosis in animal models\n[19] and response to therapy in early patient studies [20 73] \nThis method has the advantage of being available using\nexisting MRI instrumentation for both animal and patient\nimaging without the need for imaging probes  but provides a\nrelatively indirect measure of cell death \n\nSeveral methods can also measure biosynthesis as an\nindicator of tumor growth  with approaches targeted to\nprotein synthesis and membrane synthesis  The uptake of\nlabeled amino acids  such as 11C-methionine  has been\nshown to correlate with tumor growth  and changes in uptake\nprovide an early indication of breast cancer response to\ntherapy [74]  This approach  however  is limited by the\ncomplex nature of amino acid metabolism pathways  making it\ndifficult to measure protein synthetic rate versus amino acid\ntransport and metabolism [75]  Artificial amino acids have\nalso been tested as indicators of amino acid transport [76] \n\nProliferating tumor cells also engage in enhanced lipid bio-\nsynthesis to provide material needed for cellular membranes\n[77]  This process can also be assayed through molecular\nimaging using several different methods  Spurred by results in\nbrain tumor imaging [57]  MRS studies of breast cancer have\nshown increased choline pool sizes to be a feature of breast\nmalignancy [9 78]  Interestingly  changes in the choline\nconcentration measured by MRS early in treatment appear to\nbe a marker for early response to therapy  as early as 24 hours\nafter treatment with chemotherapy [22]  These exciting early\nfindings are now being tested in a large prospective\ncooperative group trial  Lipid metabolism can also be studied\nby PET using either 11C or 18F labeled choline  or 11C-acetate\n[79]  which enters lipid synthesis from the tricarboxylic acid\n TCA  cycle via fatty acid synthetase  Fatty acid synthetase\nhas been show to have increased activity and expression in\ncancer and may be a target for therapy [80]  This approach\n\nhas shown considerable promise in other tumors such as\nprostate cancer [81]  including therapeutic response [82]  but\nhas not been applied to the same extent in breast cancer [83] \n\nProtein expression  tumor receptors\nThe ability to measure the expression of specific proteins that\nare gene products associated with breast cancer has led to\nimportant advances in breast cancer treatment  Examples\ninclude the expression of estrogen receptors  ERs  a target for\nendocrine therapy [84]  and HER2  also increasingly a target of\ntumor-specific treatment [85]  Molecular imaging has also been\napplied to measuring specific protein expression [6 24] \nAdvantages of imaging include its non-invasiveness  the ability\nto measure receptor expression in the entire disease burden\nand thus the ability to avoid sampling error that can occur with\nheterogeneous receptor expression  and the potential for serial\nstudies of in vivo drug effects on the target  A very practical\nconsideration is that imaging can assess receptor expression\nat sites that are challenging to sample and assay  for example \nbone metastases  where de-calcification can make assay of\ntumor gene products challenging \n\nImaging protein expression  particularly tumor receptors \nposes some unique challenges  For receptors  imaging\nresults can be quite sensitive to the molecular quantity of the\nimaging probe needed to generate the image  Most receptors\nhave high affinity for their ligands and are active at micromolar\nor nanomolar concentrations of the ligand  Even small molar\nquantities of the imaging agent may saturate the receptor and\nlimit the ability to visualize receptor expression [86 87]  For\nthis reason  molecular imaging of tumor receptors has been\nmost successful to date with radionuclide imaging  PET and\nSPECT  where it is possible to generate images with nano-\nmolar or picomolar amounts of the imaging probe  For larger\nmolecules  like peptides and monoclonal antibodies  other\nlabels suitable for optical  MR  and ultrasound imaging are\npossible [6]  however  for small-molecule receptor imaging\nagents  such as labeled steroids for steroid receptors  radio-\nnuclide imaging appears to be the only feasible approach \n\nThe most work to date in this area of breast cancer research\nhas been done for steroid receptors [6 88]  Considerable\nefforts have gone into the development of radiopharma-\nceuticals for ER imaging  as reviewed in [88-90]  Although a\nvariety of ER imaging agents have been tested  and continue\nto be developed and tested  the most successful ER imaging\nradiopharmaceutical to date is 16 alpha-[18F]-fluoro-17 beta-\nestradiol  FES  [87 91]  FES has binding characteristics\nsimilar to estradiol for both the ER and the transport protein\nSHBG [92 93]  It can be synthesized with sufficient specific\nactivity that high-quality patient images can be made with\ninjections of less than 5 μg of FES [94]  Regional estrogen\nbinding is readily quantified by FES PET  and FES uptake has\nbeen validated as a measure of ER expression in breast\ntumors against ER expression assay of tissue samples by\nradioligand binding [95] and immunohistochemistry [96]  FES\n\nAvailable online http //breast-cancer-research com/content/10/S1/S3\n\nPage 5 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\n\n\nuptake is readily visualized and quantified in primary and\nmetastatic breast cancer [97]  It can identify heterogeneous\nER expression  for example  loss of ER expression in meta-\nstases arising from ER-expressing primary tumors [94 97] \nThe level of FES uptake has been shown to be predictive of\nresponse to endocrine therapy [94 98]  including heavily\npre-treated patients  Figure 1  Serial FES PET can also\nmeasure the pharmacodynamic effect of drugs on estradiol\nbinding to the ER [98 99]  yielding insights into determinants\nof drug efficacy \n\nWhile PET ER imaging had been successful  efforts to image\nprogesterone receptor  PR  have been less successful\n[100 101]  In a study of the PR imaging agent 21-[18F]fluoro-\n16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone  uptake was seen in some\ntumors  but the level of uptake did not correlate with the level\nof PR expression  This may be in large part due to the\nrelatively low affinity of progestins for the PR  with binding\naffinities that are orders of magnitude lower than those of\nandrogens and androgen receptors and estrogens and ERs\n[101]  As such  relatively high non-specific binding compared\nto specific binding of imaging probes may limit their utility for\nPR imaging  Later studies also showed that the radiopharma-\nceutical tested was rapidly metabolized in human to a\nmetabolite with poor receptor binding [102]  a finding that\n\nwas not predicted by pre-clinical models  Efforts to develop\neffective PR imaging agents continue [103] \n\nHER2  ErbB2  expression in breast cancer has become an\nimportant indicator of prognosis and an increasingly impor-\ntant target for therapy [104]  Recent efforts have focused on\nimaging HER2 expression in breast cancer  The most\nsuccess and largest number of studies to date used imaging\nprobes based upon immune recognition to image HER2\nexpression  Specific imaging probes based on radiolabeled\nantibodies or fragments [105-109]  or novel constructs such\nas affibodies [110 111]  have shown success in early studies \nStudies using a 68Ga-labeled F ab’ 2 fragment of trastuzumab\nby Smith-Jones and colleagues [112 113] demonstrated the\nfeasibility of measuring regional HER2 expression in murine\nanimal models  The imaging results nicely demonstrated\nalterations in HER2 expression accompanying experimental\ntherapy using HSP90-directed agents  geldamycin analogs \nto disrupt protein chaperoning and reduce HER2 expression\n[112 113]  Studies using 131I- or 111In-labeled trastuzumab\nhave demonstrated the ability to image tumor expression of\nHER2 and tumor and normal tissue accumulation of\ntrastuzumab [108 114 115]  although there has been some\ncontroversy about the significance of uptake in normal tissues\nprone to trastuzumab toxicity  such as the heart [108 115] \nPromising early patient studies have also been presented for\n89Zr-labeled trastuzumab [116] \n\nFor imaging using larger molecules like monoclonal anti-\nbodies and fragments  as in the case of HER2 imaging  an\neven wider range of probes  and therefore imaging\nmodalities  may be possible  including optical  ultrasound \nand MR-based probes [117-122]  Koyama [123] demon-\nstrated specific fluorescence imaging of HER2-expressing\nlung metastasis in an animal model  Others have used near-\ninfrared imaging of HER2 expression in vitro using gold\nnanoshell bioconjugates [124] and fluorochrome labeling\n[125]  Pre-clinical studies using specific antibodies conju-\ngated to gadolinium or magnetic nanoparticles demonstrated\nthe feasibility of MRI antibody imaging in cells [126] and\nanimal models [118]  Early studies of nanoparticle-based\nultrasound probes conjugated to HER2-specific antibodies\nhave demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in early in\nvitro studies and simulated in vivo studies [119 127]  The\nability to image with multiple modalities is particularly helpful\nfor translating research from the pre-clinical to clinical setting \nFor example  optical imaging is extremely valuable for small-\nanimal studies  but has limited utility in patients due to poor\ntissue penetration for imaging deeper structures  The ability\nto translate optical imaging findings into PET or MRI imaging\nin patients  seen in early work for HER2 imaging  holds great\npromise for facilitating translational research \n\nTumor microenvironment\nMolecular imaging provides a unique opportunity to image the\ntumor microenvironment  which is challenging by

129] \nhas been widely studied by imaging  with some recent\nstudies in breast cancer [130]  Most work has been done\nusing PET imaging and the agent 18F-fluoromisonidazole\n FMISO   Figure 2  however  other PET hypoxia probes have\nbeen developed and tested [38]  Other hypoxia imaging\nmethods based upon MRI and optical approaches are at an\nearlier stage of development  but appear promising [131 132] \n\nTumor vasculature plays a key role in tumor growth and\nmetastasis  and is also important in the delivery of systemic\ntherapeutic agents  Imaging of tumor vasculature and the\ndelivery of nutrients and drugs has also been an area of\ninterest  Tumor perfusion and capillary transport provide an\nindirect measure of tumor vasculature and can be imaged by\nDCE-MRI and PET  which have been effective in measuring\ntumor response in early studies [16 38 39]  In addition \ntargeted imaging probes can non-invasively and specifically\nassess tumor neo-vasculature  PET probes based upon\nspecific labeled peptides that bind to integrins expressed in\nneovessels have been studied in animals and tested in\nhumans [133 134]  MRI probes have been developed and\nare at an earlier stage of testing [40]  Such agents may be\nespecially helpful for therapies directed at tumor neo-\nvasculature  such as bevacizumab \n\nImaging methods to measure nutrient and drug transport have\nalso been developed and tested  For example  the SPECT\nagent 99mTc-sestamibi  developed for myocardial perfusion\nimaging  has been shown to be a substrate for the drug efflux\ntransporter P-glycoprotein [135]  Studies in the setting of pre-\nsurgical chemotherapy showed that the uptake and retention\nof 99mTc-sestamibi was predictive of response to chemo-\ntherapeutic agents that are substrates for P-glycoprotein  such\nas epirubicin [136]  Somewhat more specific and quantitative\nprobes of P-glycoprotein transport have been developed for\nPET imaging [137-139]  Macromolecular MRI contrast agents\nare undergoing testing in patients [140] and may be useful for\nmeasuring the delivery of therapeutic agents  such as\ntrastuzumab  that are large molecules where capillary and\ninterstitial transport may pose significant barriers \n\nReporter gene imaging and cell labeling\nAdvances in cancer biology have led to an increasing array of\napproaches to breast cancer therapy  including immuno-\ntherapy and gene therapy  These advances in turn lead to the\nneed for increasingly sophisticated approaches for imaging to\nmonitor these treatments  An increasing body of work in\nmolecular imaging has therefore been devoted to imaging\napproaches capable of imaging gene expression and cellular\ntrafficking and survival in vivo [12 82] \n\nParalleling work done in reporter systems for cell culture \nimaging reporter systems have been developed and are\nincreasingly used in animal model research [141-143] \n\nReporter imaging can use optical approaches  with reporter\ngenes expressing optically detectable molecules such as\ngreen fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase  Optical\napproaches provide inexpensive  readily available methods for\nimaging reporter gene expression  and are widely used in\ncurrent research [144]  Radionuclide methods have also\nbeen developed and widely tested in animal models [143] \nThe most popular approach has been based upon the use of\nviral thymidine kinase as a reporter gene  combined with\nlabeled probes that are specific substrates for phos-\nphorylation by viral thymidine kinase [145 146]  This results in\nprobe trapping and high-contrast  readily quantifiable images\n[147]  A variety of other radionuclide reporter systems have\nbeen used  including the NaI symporter and radioiodine \nreceptor expression  for example  dopamine  and receptor\nbinding ligands  and alternative metabolic substrates\n[148 149]  Some progress has also been made in MRI\nreporter systems [150 151]  however  this work is at an\nearlier stage than optical and PET approaches \n\nThe development of therapeutic approaches mediated by\nspecific cells - for example  immunotherapy - has generated\nincreasing interest in cell labeling and imaging  Cell labeling\n\nAvailable online http //breast-cancer-research com/content/10/S1/S3\n\nPage 7 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nFigure 2\n\nBreast tumor

often\nrequires isolation of the cells to assure that only the desired\ncells are imaged  In cell therapy where molecular\nmanipulation is possible  cells engineered with reporter\nsystems can also be used to provide specific cell labeling\nthat does not require isolation of cells and that remains with\nthe cells through subsequent generations  unlike most non-\nspecific methods [153]  For immunotherapy  the generation\nof reporter systems that do not themselves engender an\nimmune response is a challenge and represents an active\narea of research [154] \n\nSummary and future directions\nAdvances in molecular biology create new opportunities for\nunderstanding and treating breast cancer  and also create\nnew needs for increasingly sophisticated and quantitative\nassays  Advances in both technology and molecular biology\nhave led to the capability for molecular imaging  a method for\nnon-invasive and regional assay of in vivo tumor biology \nWhile some molecular imaging methods  most notably\nSPECT and PET  have begun to be used in patients  many\nmolecular imaging approaches have  as yet  undergone only\nearly testing at a pre-clinical stage  Some methods  such as\noptical reporter gene imaging  have already become an\nimportant part of basic research in animal models  Other\napproaches  such as PET imaging of tumor receptor\nexpression  look very promising in early patient studies  but\nhave yet to make it to larger clinical trials or clinical practice \nOnly a relatively few approaches  such as FDG PET  have\nmade their way into clinical practice \n\nMolecular imaging offers a very powerful tool for translating\nbasic science into clinical benefit  This can happen in several\nways  Demonstration that molecular pathways discovered in\nanimal models have relevance to human breast cancer is a\ncritical aspect of breast cancer translational research  Mole-\ncular imaging offers a way to assess and quantify pathways in\nboth animal models and patients in order to verify that the\npathways behave similarly in both cases  In addition  molecular\nimaging used to guide drug development and pre-clinical\ntesting can be applied to early clinical studies to provide\nproof-of-concept  early evidence of efficacy  and a pharma-\ncodynamic measure by which to optimize dosing [155] \n\nThere are a number of potential hurdles to translating\nmolecular imaging methods from animals to humans  Some\napproaches that work well in animals - for example  optical\nimaging - may not be applicable to patients  Multi-modality\nimaging approaches - for example  combined optical/MR/PET\nreporters - may be very helpful in this regard  There may be\nsignificant regulatory hurdles to the use of some imaging\nprobes in patients  Recent efforts in collaborations between\nthe NCI  FDA  and other organizations show promise in\nhelping to facilitate clinical trials of new probes [156] \n\nEchoing trends in molecular breast cancer therapy  clinical\ntrials of molecular imaging may need new approaches to\nclinical study design  using measures such as prognosis or\nresponse as endpoints  rather than sensitivity and specificity\nfor tumor detection [4]  Cooperative groups and scientific\norganizations have recognized this need and are beginning to\naddress it through a variety of approaches  including multi-\ncenter trials [157]  While somewhat daunting  these hurdles\nare clearly surmountable by close collaboration between\nbreast cancer biologists  clinicians  and imagers  Early results\nsuggest that molecular imaging will play an important role in\ntranslational breast cancer research and the care of breast\ncancer patients and strongly support ongoing efforts in this\narea of research

October 22  2008  sent for review October 11  2008 \n\nAlthough the role of liganded nuclear receptors in mediating\ncoactivator/corepressor exchange is well-established  little is\nknown about the potential regulation of chromosomal organiza-\ntion in the 3-dimensional space of the nucleus in achieving inte-\ngrated transcriptional responses to diverse signaling events  Here \nwe report that ligand induces rapid interchromosomal interactions\namong specific subsets of estrogen receptor  -bound transcription\nunits  with a dramatic reorganization of nuclear territories  which\ndepends on the actions of nuclear actin/myosin-I machinery and\ndynein light chain 1  The histone lysine demethylase  LSD1  is\nrequired for these ligand-induced interactive loci to associate with\ndistinct interchromatin granules  long thought to serve as ‘‘stor-\nage’’ sites for the splicing machinery  some critical transcription\nelongation factors  and various chromatin remodeling complexes \nWe demonstrate that this 2-step nuclear rearrangement is essential\nfor achieving enhanced  coordinated transcription of nuclear re-\nceptor target genes \n\nenhancement of gene expression   nuclear architecture  \nchromosomal movement   interchromosomal interactions   SC35 domains\n\nThe molecular mechanism used by nuclear receptors to mediatecoactivator/corepressor exchanges in gene activation has been\nwell elucidated  1  2  However  recent genome-wide analyses of\nDNA binding sites for transcription factors  including estrogen\nreceptor  ER   revealed numerous intergenic sites  only a few of\nwhich have clearly been established to function as enhancers in vivo\n 3–5  raising intriguing questions about whether and how some of\nthese remote binding sites might communicate with their putative\ntarget genes via long-distance intrachromosomal and  potentially \ninterchromosomal interactions \nAlthough the architectural organization of the nucleus is still\n\npoorly understood  6  7  repartitioning of active genes from\ninterior to the periphery of nuclear territories has been suggested\nfor Hox genes in ES cells  8  IgH in   lymphocytes  9  c-maf in\nT cells  10  Mash1 in neuronal cells  11  and Cftr in adenocar-\ncinoma cells  12  Many recent studies have documented inter-\nchromosomal interactions to provide novel control mechanisms\nfor regulated gene expression in interphase nuclei  13–20 \nHere  we report rapid and 17 -estradiol  E2 -induced inter-\n\nactions between gene loci located in different chromosomes \nsuggesting a potentially dynamic system that operates to provide\ncoordinated control for regulated gene expression inmammalian\ncells  We found that the interacting loci exhibit LSD1-dependent\ninteractions with interchromatin granules that harbor key factors\nfor transcriptional elongation and pre-mRNA splicing  suggest-\ning at least 2 steps for nuclear reorganization and gene repar-\ntitioning critical for enhanced gene expression  These findings\nprovide a model for coordinated regulation of specific gene\ntranscription in the nucleus  and we suggest that the strategy may\nbe widely used for signal-induced gene expression programs \n\nResults\nIdentification of Estrogen-Induced Interchromosomal Interactions \nWe devised an initial  open-ended approach to detecting long-\ndistance genomic interactions by coupling the chromosome\nconformation capture  3C  assay  21  with the ChIP-DSL strat-\negy that we recently developed for large-scale promoter array\nand tiling array analyses  22  a method we refer to as decon-\nvolution of DNA interaction by DSL or the 3D assay  Fig  1A \nIn pilot experiments on MCF7 cells treated with E2 for 60min \nwe isolated DNA after in situ restriction digestion followed by\nligation under an extreme dilution condition according to the\nestablished 3C protocol  and after sonication of the DNA  we\nused a biotinylated oligonucleotides to capture DNA fragments\nthat contain the enhancer of the well-studied E2-regulated TFF1\ngene  To detect DNA fragments that were linked to the TFF1\nenhancer during 3C  we annealed a set of DSL oligonucleotide\npairs targeting individual genomic blocks in a 1 4 Mb tiled path\nsurrounding the TFF1 gene in chromosome 21  Fig  S1A  After\nselection  ligation  amplification  and hybridization on the cor-\nresponding tiling

2D  These results establish rapid\nnuclear reorganization in interphase cells in response to ligand \n\nRequirements for ER -Dependent Interchromosomal Interactions  In-\nteractions between TFF1 and GREB1 were apparently depen-\ndent on ER  binding  because a specific siRNA  proven to\neffectively knockdown ER   5  27  effectively blocked the\nE2-induced GREB1 TFF1 interactions  Fig  2E  We next per-\nformed single cell nuclear microinjection  using specific siRNAs\nor blocking antibodies against several specific coactivators \nincluding CBP/p300  Fig  2F  and the p160 coactivator SRC1/\npCIP  Fig  2G  as established  5  27  finding that inactivation\nof these coactivators for ER  also abolished the E2-dependent\nTFF1 GREB1 interactions  We also examined the histone lysine\ndemethylase 1  LSD1  which was recently shown to be essential\nfor E2-dependent gene activation  5  Unexpectedly  we ob-\nserved that LSD1 knockdown had little effect on the E2-\ndependent interchromosomal interactions between the two\ngenes  Fig  2H  This finding implies that E2-induced interchro-\nmosomal interactions precede gene activation \nAlthough there is no filamentous actin in the nucleus  nuclear\n\nactin is present in many transcriptional complexes and reported\nto play an important role in transcriptional activation in yeast\n 28  29  We could also detect oligomerized g-actin with a\nspecific monoclonal antibody  30  in the nucleus of normal\nbreast epithelial cells  Fig  S3A  Treatment of E2-stimulated\nbreast epithelial cells with either latrunculin  a well-\ncharacterized drug that blocks actin polymerization  31  or\nJasplakinolide  which inhibits depolymerization of actin net-\nworks  32  caused a complete loss of E2-induced interchromo-\nsomal interactions  Fig  3A and Fig  S2B  These treatments also\ninhibited E2-induced expression of TFF1 and GREB1  but not\nconstitutive genes  e g   -actin  in MCF7 cells  Fig  3B \nTo further investigate the possibility that interchromosomal\n\ninteractions depend on dynamic nuclear reorganization  we\nperformed single cell nuclear microinjection assay to determine\nthe potential requirement for Nuclear Myosin-I  NMI   33 \nfinding that a specific siRNA against NMI abolished E2-induced\nTFF1 GREB1 interactions  Fig  3C  We also found that nuclear\ninjection of antibodies against NMI blocked E2-induced\nTFF1 GREB1 interactions  Fig  3CRight and Fig  S3B–D  as did\nsimilar single cell nuclear microinjection of the monoclonal\nantibody  2G2  against g-actin  Fig  S3 B–D  Immunohisto-\nchemical analysis confirmed nuclear localization of injected IgG\nagainst NMI and g-actin  Fig  S3 B and D  strongly suggesting\na direct functional requirement for NMI in the nucleus  rather\nthan an indirect effect caused by a disrupted cytoskeleton  To\ndocument the involvement of NMI-based nuclear motors in\nmediating E2-induced interchromosomal interactions  we pre-\nformed rescue experiments  using NMImutants that impair actin\nbinding  e g  R353C  or the ATPase activity  e g  S397L  in the\nnuclear myosin-I ‘‘head’’  34  35  We found that the interchro-\nmosomal interactions abolished with anti-NMI IgG could be\nrestored using the expression vector expressing WT  but not\nmutant NMI defective in actin binding or lacking ATPase\nactivity  Fig  3D and E  This finding agrees with a recent report\nshowing that NMI is required for transcription activation-\ninduced DNA looping out of the nuclear territory  36  We also\ndocumented that WT  but not functionally inactive NMI mu-\ntants  rescued the

Disruption of NMI or DLC1 by siRNA did\nnot cause aberrant recruitment of ER  or its coactivators  such\nas CBP/p300  to the TFF1 promoter  Fig  S6  which suggests that\nthese components of the nuclear motor system act after initial\nER  binding and coactivator recruitment events \n\nFunctional Consequences of Induced Interchromosomal Interactions \nBoth the siRNA and the antibody microinjection experiments\ndescribed above established a correlation between hormone-\ninduced interchromosomal interactions and gene activation  To\ndirectly demonstrate the functional requirement of E2-induced\ninterchromosomal interactions for gene activation  we took\nadvantage of the observation that  50% of cells exhibited\nmonoallelic interactions between chromosome 2 and chromo-\nsome 21 to ask whether the transcription of gene loci engaged in\nthe interchromosomal interactions was enhanced compared with\nnoninteracting alleles in the same cells  We performed RNA\nFISH using probes that span exon-exon junctions and confirmed\n\nthe specificity of the probes in detecting RNA by showing that\nRNase A treatment  14  abolished hybridization signals  data\nnot shown  By determining the volume of the RNA signals for\neach transcript for colocalized and noncolocalized signals  we\nwere able to quantify the level of transcription associated with\ninteracting and noninteracting alleles before and after the E2\ntreatment  Fig  4E  We found that E2 induced modest activation\nof TFF1 and GREB1 from ‘‘noninteracting’’ alleles  suggesting\nthat both alleles may be equally competent in transcriptional\nactivation  Remarkably  expression of these ER  target genes\nexhibited enhancement when engaged in specific interchromo-\nsomal interactions  therefore demonstrating the functional sig-\nnificance of interchromosomal interactions in enhancement of\ngene activation  indeed  this was actually more robust in cells\nwith monoallelic  as opposed to biallelic  interactions  Fig  4E \nThree color DNA RNA serial FISH experiments  using a TFF1\nDNA FISH probe confirmed the colocalization of the genomic\nlocus  and the two colocalized RNA transcripts  data not shown \n\nInterchromatin Granules  Hubs for Interchromosomal Interactions \nHaving established nuclear actin/myosin-mediated gene net-\nworking in the nucleus  we next determined potential nuclear\ndomains that permit or underlie such functional interchromo-\nsomal interactions  We suspected a possible spatial relationship\nwith nuclear speckles  formally known as interchromatin gran-\nules that are enriched with several key transcriptional elongation\nfactors  chromatin remodeling complexes  and essentially all\nfactors required for pre-mRNA splicing  7  38  To test this\nhypothesis  we determined colocalization between FISH probes\nand the splicing factor SC35  a marker for interchromatin\ngranules  39  Inmock-treated primary breast epithelial cells  the\nposition of the TFF1 andGREB1 foci were entirely distinct from\nSC35-positive speckles  Upon E2 treatment  however  the inter-\nacting TFF1/GREB1 foci became intimately associated with two\nof the SC35-positive speckles  Intriguingly  in cells exhibiting\nmonoallelic interactions  the interacting loci  but not noninter-\nacting loci  were observed to associate with interchromatin\ngranules  Fig  5A  In cells with biallelic interactions  both were\npresent in interchromatin granules  Fig  5B  Blocking actin\noligomerization with latrunculin or actin depolymerization with\njasplakinolide impaired the association  Fig  S5C  Likewise \nsiRNAs against DLC1 or BAF53 all similarly blocked the colo-\ncalization of the FISH probes with interchromatin granules  Fig \nS5 B and C and data not shown  These findings suggest that\ninterchromatin granules may function as hubs for gene network-\ning in the nucleus \nBecause LSD1 siRNA was able to block E2-dependent tran-\n\nscription of TFF1 and GREB1  but not their interchromosomal\ninteractions  we investigated whether there might be an effect on\ntheir coalescence with nuclear speckles  Intriguingly  depletion\nof LSD1 by specific siRNA prevented the TFF1/GREB1 loci\nfrom interacting with interchromatin granules as determined by\nboth 2D and 3D FISH with wild-type  but not enzymatically\ninactive LSD1  fully rescuing hub  interchromatin granule inter-\naction  Fig  5 C–E  In concert with our previous observation\nthat LSD1 siRNA decreased  but did not abolish ER  recruit-\nment  5  we detected only a modest reduction in the recruitment\nof coactivators  such as CBP/p300  to ER  target genes in\nresponse to E2  Fig  S7  Together  these findings reveal an\nunexpected role of LSD1 in exerting a key regulatory function in\nlinking transcriptional initiation to full gene activation by pro-\nmoting the association of initial interacting loci to nuclear\ndomains enriched with critical factors for transcription and\ncotranscriptional processing \n\nDiscussion\nOur findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of liganded\nnuclear receptors in initiating specific interchromosomal inter-\n\nFig  4  Enhanced

transcription  Our data also connect nuclear receptor-\nmediated recruitment of coactivators to the actions of the\nnuclear motor machinery in establishing ligand-induced intra-\nand interchromosomal interactions and the association of inter-\nacting gene loci with interchromatin granules  which constitutes\na more complex program for hormone-induced gene expression\nthan previously suspected  Our finding that NMI plays a key role\nin E2-induced gene activation program is consistent with its\ndocumented role in gene expression in other experimental\nsystems  28  29  32  40–42 \nThese data suggest a general model in which dynamic nuclear\n\narchitecture permits rapid association of specific interacting\ngenomic loci with potential ‘‘enhancer hubs’’ for higher level\ninteractions of DNA-bound transcription factors with their\ncofactors  Fig  5F  These events appear to represent at least a\n‘‘two-step’’ program  with a specific histone lysine demethylase\n LSD1  serving as a critical mediator to link initial induced\ninteracting gene loci to interchromatin granules  Our findings of\nrapid  regulated nuclear reorganization is in accord with the\ndocumented role of nuclear actin in mediating the assembly of\nPol II and coactivator complexes  29  43  and with specific\ninterchromosomal interaction events observed in other signal-\ninduced transcription systems  20  44–47  These findings un-\nderscore the chromosome mobility in interphase cells  which has\nbeen appreciated only recently  36  48  49 \nIn contrast to yeast  higher eukaryotic cells seem to have\n\npartitioned their nucleus into various subdomains  50  Strik-\ningly  the dynamic E2-dependent  ER -mediated interchromo-\nsomal interactions has proven to coincide with interchromatin\ngranules  and surprisingly  LSD1 is required for the association\nof initial interacting gene loci with these interchromosomal hubs \nwhich have long been considered as ‘‘storage’’ sites for splicing\nfactors  51  Because interchromatin granules are also enriched\nfor phosphorylated Pol II  several transcriptional elongation\nfactors  such as p-TEFb  and key chromatin remodeling com-\n\nplexes  such as SWI/SNF  reviewed in ref  7  we may now\nconsider this nuclear domain as a specialized ‘‘nuclear factory ’’\nFor hormone-induced genes  the detected

metastasis  circulating tumor cells\n\nIntroduction\nRecent studies show that entry of tumor cells into the circulation and subsequent metastasis\noccur early in breast cancer progression  1 2  Although effective detection of “rare” tumor\ncells  a few CTCs in 1-mL of blood  remains technically challenging  populations of CTCs \nidentified by various technologies focusing on the epithelial cell surface marker EpCAM  also\nknown as ESA/Epi/TADST   3 4  have been shown to correlate with cancer progression  5 \n6  Likewise  CTC detection based on multiple epithelial lineage mRNAs using sensitive PCR-\nbased molecular assays  7 8  appear useful for establishing clinical correlations with early\nbreast cancer prognosis \n\nTumor cells expressing invasive phenotypes lose many types of epithelial antigens in a\ntransformation process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition  EMT   9-11  The transition \nwhich occurs early in cancer progression  involves tumor progenitor  TP  cells with stem/\ninvasive cell properties  12 13  Such cells may enter the circulation to generate multiple\npopulations of CTCs with specific phenotypes  2 4  that could contribute to aggressive growth\nof tumor cells in the lung and to early metastatic colony formation  14 15  However  the\nmajority of current technologies for CTC detection involve either use of antibody against\nEpCAM for complex analytic approaches such as immuno-affinity micropost  CTC-chip™ \nor immuno-magnetic particles  CellSearch™  or multiplex qPCR approaches for tumor-\nassociated mRNAs  5 6  Low EpCAM expression by hematopoietic micrometastases has been\nreported  and attempts to isolate CTCs using antibodies against EpCAM result in loss of most\nof the CTCs in some cases  16-19  In addition  whether the epithelial cells isolated by these\nmethods exhibit the invasive phenotype and express stem cell markers is not well understood \n\nSince the proclivity of a tumor cell to invade collagenous matrices is one of the hallmarks of\nmetastasis  20 21  we hypothesized that populations of CTCs that adhere and invade\ncollagenous matrices would be invasive and exhibit the propensity of progenitor cells to\nmetastasize  We reasoned that an enrichment step based on function of invadopodia  which are\nsubcellular structures involved in cell invasion into collagenous matrices  22 23  would serve\nto separate CTCs from the majority of cell types found in the blood  Recently  we demonstrated\nthe principle that metastatic tumor cells derived from peritoneal effusions of ovarian cancer\npatients were invasive when in contact with collagenous matrices  24  We further developed\nCTC enrichment and identification prototypes using collagen adhesion matrix  CAM  for uses\nin cellular analysis of ovarian cancer  25  and molecular analysis of prostate cancer  26  The\nCAM-coated prototypes enrich tumor cells in blood and peritoneal fluid based on their unique\navidity to the CAM enabling sensitive cellular and molecular analyses of ovarian and prostate\ncancers  A particular feature is that CAM surfaces allow direct assessment of tumor cell\ninvasiveness by their ability to remove and ingest CAM fragments  called CAM uptake  and\nfacilitate an independent means of identifying a tumor cell using the CAM uptake criterion \n\nConsidering the wide range of sensitivity  0 7-176 CTCs per mL of blood  and yields\n 14-100%  of CTC detection in patients with metastatic breast cancer  5 6  in this study we\naimed   a  to determine if the CAM method generates an effective and sensitive detection of\nCTCs in breast cancer  and  b  to examine if populations of CTCs with novel phenotypic\nexpression exist  The CAM method achieved effective enrichment and identification  and\nsuccessfully detected CTCs in whole blood of an experimental setting in 18 of 18  100% \nsamples and that of metastatic breast cancer patients in 10 of 10  100%  samples  with a range\n\nLu et al  Page 2\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2010 March 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

circulating\nepithelial cells with the collagen-invasive phenotype in early stage breast cancer patients  We\ndemonstrate that the relative frequency of invasive CTCs correlates to the staging  lymph node-\nstatus and survival of patients with early stage breast cancer  CAM-captured cells derived from\nblood of breast cancer patients are capable of propagation in culture  Concomitantly  we\nshowed by gene expression profiling that CAM-enriched circulating cells retained the\nexpression of distinct sets of epithelial and tumor progenitor or EMT stem cell  CD44 and\nTWIST1  genes  Furthermore  we showed by multiplex fluorescent activated cell sorting\n FACS  that CAM-captured CTC populations consist of epithelial lineage cells  Epi+ cell \nEpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  and tumor progenitor cells  TP+ cell \nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  in which 50-75% of the two populations overlap  Epi+TP+ cell \nCD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  We conclude that the CAM method may provide an\neffective novel tool for

in\nage  surgery type  tumor histology or grade  ER/PR/Her-2 status  including 10 triple negative\npatients  or type of chemo received between the two groups \n\nCTC detection rates varied significantly by stage  most Stage III breast cancer patients  86 4% \nhad at least one detectable CTC  while only about 27 3% of Stage I patients  and 28 6% of\nStage II patients had detectable CTCs

not shown \n\nMolecular phenotyping of circulating cells isolated by CAM from breast cancer patients\nTo examine that cells isolated by CAM are viable  cells of the MNC fraction  pre-CAM  and\ncaptured by Vita-Assay™  post-CAM  were stained using a LIVE/DEAD viability kit  Fig  5-\na b  A mixture of live green fluorescent cells and dead red fluorescent cells in the MNC\nfractions was seen prior to CAM enrichment but reduced dead red cells in post-CAM fraction\n Fig  5-a  Dead red fluorescent cells were frequently seen in the MNC fractions  Fig  5-b  Pre-\nCAM  66%±2% viable  mean±SE  n=10  but dead red fluorescent cells were quite infrequent\nafter CAM enrichment  Fig  5-b  post-CAM  99 9%±0 1% viable  n=10  p>0 0001  indicating\nthat CAM enrichment returns nearly 100% viable circulating cells \n\nTo determine the ability of circulating cells isolated by CAM from breast cancer patients to\npropagate into the epithelial phenotype in vitro  we cultured the cells on the same CAM\nsubstrata  Freshly isolated circulating cells locally degraded the underlying CAM and exhibited\nCAM uptakes within one day of culture  Fig  5-c  large white arrows  This was not observed\nfor hematopoietic cells captured by CAM  Fig  5-c  small arrows  The number and size of\ncells increased over time in culture  resulting in sizeable colonies within 10 days  Fig  5-d \nlarge white arrows pointing to round cells  and large spread cells with epithelial morphology\nafter 20 days  Fig  5-d  open white arrows pointing to spread and large epithelial cells  whereas\nco-purified

\n\nTo examine if markers known to express in breast tumors could be found in certain populations\nof the circulating cells isolated by CAM from breast cancer patients  we performed gene\nexpression

leukocytes  per mL of blood from nine breast cancer patients and none tumor cells\nfrom 7 healthy women  blood sample set A  and subjected blood samples to the one-step CAM\nmethod  Vita-Cap™   b  We then used the RNA extracted from CAM-enriched cells from\ncancer patients and compared it with RNA extracted from CAM-enriched cells from healthy\nwomen to generate gene expression profiles of cancer-associated genes and to subtract genes\nupregulated in the “normal” leukocyte cells captured by CAM  Comparative gene expression\nprofiling was performed using the Affymetrix HG_U133_Plus_2 chip  containing 54 675 gene\nprobes  47 000 transcripts and variants  After a global scaling procedure was performed to\nnormalize the expression data between experiments  we screened >1 000 genes  a fold-change\n>2 at a probability  1 000 genes that were significantly upregulated in cancer samples\n for potential tumor markers  as well as 11 epithelial lineage markers  known to express in\nepithelial tumors  and leukocyte adhesion receptors  as internal marker controls  from the\ngenechip  Figs  6-a  6-b  and supplementary Table 1S  to examine differential expression of\nselected genes in cancer and normal samples \n\nUpregulation of these selected genes in cancer samples was determined in both the training set\nof blood samples  blood sample set A  that consists of 7 normal and 9 breast cancer samples\n Fig  6-a  and the testing set  blood sample set B  that consists of 9 normal and 20 breast cancer\nsamples  Fig  6-b  In cancer samples that contained >60 CTCs/mL blood  the four cytokeratin\ngenes  KRT8  KRT16  KRT17 and KRT19  and eight tumor-associated genes  TERT  MUC16/\nM17S2/CA125  CD44  TWIST1  TACSTD1/EpCAM/CD326/ESA/HEA125/GA733  DPP4/\nCD26  ESR1 and PGR  were upregulated  whereas the 3 internal control genes  ITGA2 \nCD14 and ITGB3  and the six breast tumor genes  VIM  MUC1  ERBB2  CD24  EGFR and\nDPP5/FAP/seprase/APCE  exhibit no specific expression  Figs  6-a  6-b  and supplementary\nTable 1S  The expression data strongly suggest that circulating cells enriched by CAM from\ncancer samples are heterogeneous and contain subpopulations that express specific epithelial\nlineage  stem or progenitor markers \n\nTo examine whether distinct populations of circulating cells isolated by CAM exist  multiplex\nfluorescent activated cell sorting  FACS  of CAM-captured cells was performed  The\nfollowing four-five marker combinations were used to sort individual epithelial  Epi  and tumor\nprogenitor  TP  cells   a  Epi+ cell – EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−   b  TP+ cell –\nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  and  c  Epi+TP+ cell – CD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD− \n\nMultiplex FACS was used to sort the circulating cells pre-enriched by CAM into homogeneous\ncells using the five markers  in which EpCAM and CD44 are for positive selection  but CD34\nand CD45  both conjugated with APC  negatively sort out hematopoietic cells and 7AAD to\nexclude dead cells  Fig  7  FACS gating for specific expression of Epi and TP markers in\ncancer samples includes the use of circulating cells captured by CAM from normal blood\nsamples as the baseline measurement  so that we obtain a cutoff value of ≤5 Epi+ and TP+ cells/\nmL in control normal blood samples  Fig  7-d  e and f  Consistently  >5 Epi+  TP+ and\nEpi+TP+ cells/mL were identified in the blood samples from breast cancer patients  Fig  7-a \nb and c  A single-cell-sorted Epi+ cell is identified as a EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD− cell\nin blood samples  Fig  7-a and d  number of cells/mL in red  TP+ cell is a\nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD− cell  Fig  7-b and e  number of cells/mL blood in red  and\nEpi+TP+ cell is a CD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD− cell  Fig  7-c and f  number of cells/\nmL blood in red  These cells could be discriminated from co-purifying circulating\nhematopoietic stem cells and leukocytes that were CD34+CD45+ and from dead cells that were\n7AAD+  The latter demonstrates that both CAM-enrichment of viable cells and 7AAD\nexclusion of dead cells are crucial to achieve accuracy  as the remaining dead cells show high\n\nLu et al  Page 9\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript

results demonstrate that CAM enrichment\nof circulating cells and multiplex flow cytometry provide a powerful opportunity for\nphenotyping of different populations of circulating tumor cells in cancer patients \n\nDiscussion\nCurrent approaches to enrich or sort tumor cells from the peripheral blood for CTC detection\ninvolve the use of a few epithelial lineage markers in specialized methods and devices  These\napproaches include Ficoll density gradient centrifugation-imaging system  28  flow cytometry\n 29  immunomagnetic particle-imaging system  CellSearch  30  microfluidic imaging\nsystem  CTC chip  31  high-throughput optical-imaging system  32  and fiber optic array\nscanning  33  CellSearch detects CTCs based on a cell enrichment step using anti-EpCAM\nantibodies and tumor cell identification using cytokeratin  KRT8  KRT18 and KRT19 \nexpression  30  and is currently the lead technology approved by FDA for use in the clinical\nsetting  Using similar antibodies to enrich and cytokeratin expression to identify tumor cells \na recent report showed that CTC chip detected one to two orders of magnitude more CTCs  79\n±52 cells/mL  from metastatic breast cancer patients than CellSearch  31  However  there is\nno conscience how to compare CTC detection between these two methods and others  since\nblood samples and modes of cell enrichment and antigens used in other analytic approaches\nsignificantly differ  6 \n\nFor example  the CAM-initiated CTC detection method reported here reveals 126±25  mean\n±SD  cells/mL blood from metastatic breast cancer patients that are CAM+Epi+  i e  cells with\ndetectable expression of upregulated TACSTD1/EpCAM/ CD326/ESA/ HEA125/GA733 and\nKRT-4 5 6 8 10 13 18 antigens  as well as invasive/progenitor cell properties  EpCAM and\ncytokeratin expression is an essential positive selection criterion in major CTC detection\nmethods  However  the CAM method identifies the cell invasiveness simultaneously while\nrecognizing epithelial lineage antigens  Figs  1-2  suggesting that the assay selects a\nsubpopulation of epithelial cells that invades the extracellular matrix  Like disseminated tumor\ncells in bone marrow isolated by the Ficoll density gradient centrifugation method  34  CAM-\ncaptured cells are capable of propagation in culture  Fig  5 \n\nAlthough HER2  ER and PR are considered as important breast tumor markers  our\nimmunofluorescent assay for CTC identification  involving CAM  Epi and CD45  did not find\ncorrelations between the expression of HER2  ER and PR in primary tumors and levels of\nCTCs detected  Table 1  However  we showed by Affymetrix DNA microarray profiling of\ncirculating cells isolated by the single step Vita-Cap™ method  Fig  6  that some known breast\ntumor markers  including CD44  TACSTD1/EpCAM  TERT  MUC16/CA125  DPP4/CD26 \nESR1/ER and PGR/PR  are likely upregulated in specific populations of the circulating cells\ncaptured by CAM from cancer blood samples  whereas others  including MUC1  VIM  DPP5/\nFAP and ERBB2/Erb-2/HER2  are also expressed in un-identified populations of CAM-avid\ncells in normal blood samples  Considering that HER2  ER and PR are important therapeutic\ntargets for breast cancer  it will be interesting to investigate which populations of circulating\ncells enriched by CAM that express these targets in patients during therapeutic intervention \n\nExpression profiling of CAM-captured cells from breast cancer patients indeed shows the\nupregulation of mRNAs reflective of multiple populations of CTCs  To validate this concept \nwe showed by multiplex FACS  Fig  7  that CAM-captured circulating cells from breast cancer\npatients consisted of three distinct populations  epithelial lineage cells  Epi+ cell \nEpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  and tumor progenitor cells  TP+ cell \nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  in which 50-75% of the two populations overlap  Epi+TP+ cell \nCD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  Thus  the CAM method could detect at least three\nsubpopulations of invasive CTCs with epithelial  progenitor and epithelial/progenitor\n\nLu et al  Page 10\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2010 March

sample showing\nthat CAM+Epi+ cells substantially overlapped with Epi+TP+ cells \n\nIn spiking model experiments we found that the CAM method is about 100-times more\nsensitive than the epithelial cell immuno-magnetic isolation to detect MDA-MB-231 tumor\ncells spiked in whole blood  Fig  1-a  Previous reports showed that  when cells derived from\ndifferent tumor cell lines were used to perform epithelial cell capture using specific antibodies\nfor the initial cell enrichment  the spiked tumor cells were recovered with different rates  30 \n31  Specifically  the CAM method enriched MDA-MB-231 tumor cells spiked in whole blood\nto the extent that were readily detected by fluorescence microscopic assay for epithelial markers\n EpCAM  ESA and cytokeratins  but CellSearch™ that targeted on EpCAM for the initial cell\nenrichment could not detect any MDA-MB-231 cells that had low EpCAM expression on the\ncell surface  4  However  the CellSearch™ test could effectively detect other tumor cell types\nthat expressed high EpCAM on the cell surface  4  Thus  commonly used antibody-based cell\nenrichment methods such as the CellSearch™ test are effective to detect specific populations\nof CTCs that express targeted antigens  whereas the CAM method is efficient in the recovery\nof rare circulating cells that have strong avidity to the ECM to enable immuno-phenotyping of\nmultiple populations of CTCs \n\nWe have made an attempt to compare capture efficiency of tumor cells spiked in the “model”\nblood using a one-step CAM enrichment  Fig  1-a  WB Vita-Cap™  and a two-step method\n Fig  1-a  MNC-1 Vita-Assay™  in which the blood samples were pre-processed using Ficoll\ndensity gradient centrifugation  Original tumor cell dose spiked in whole blood was determined\nby first removing their red blood cells using a red cell lysing buffer  and measuring by FACS\nin a Trucount tube  BD Biosciences  We found that there is 30-40% cell loss in the MNC\nfractionation that generates a recovery rate of 77 3%±7 1%  n=9  Fig  1-a  MNC-1 Vita-\nAssay™  of tumor cells with the two-step CAM method  Fig  1-a  In comparison  the one-\nstep CAM method has recovery rate of 46 8%±12 2%  n=9  Fig  1-a  WB Vita-Cap™  Fig  1-\na  We also found that the level of CAM+Epi+ cells resolved with the two-step CAM method\ncorrelates with expression profiling of circulating cells isolated by the single step Vita-Cap™\nmethod  Fig  6  that retain the upregulated expression of epithelial lineage  KRT8  KRT16 \nKRT17  KRT19  TERT and MUC16/M17S2/CA125  and EMT stem cell  CD44 and TWIST1 \ngenes  Together  these results suggest that pre-processing of blood samples is not necessary\nfor CAM procedures \n\nIn this study  we also investigated the prognostic value of epithelial cells with the invasive\nphenotype present in peripheral blood of patients with early stage breast cancer  We reason\nthat detection of these invasive CTCs may offer an alternative method to assess metastatic\nprogression that may be of prognostic value  We demonstrated that invasive CTCs were\ndetected in 52% of patients with stage I-III breast cancer and the CTC counts significantly\ncorrelated with advanced stage disease  lymph node status  shorter disease-free survival and\nshorter overall survival  Also  we documented the decreased disease-free survival  p-value\n0 005  and overall survival  p-value 0 04  in early stage  stages I-III  breast cancer patients\nwho had ≥10 CTC counts per mL of blood  The cut-off value is higher than that of commonly\nused methods  We could explain that these circulating cells might represent subpopulations of\n“normal-like or stem” cells  which are yet to develop their aggressive behavior and could not\nbe detected by other commonly used methods  Nevertheless  our findings indicate that as breast\ncancer progresses  a greater number of invasive CTCs are present \n\nCTCs  as defined by cytokeratin  CK  positivity and CD45 negativity  are detected in metastatic\nbreast cancer patients and their higher number is related with worse disease-free and overall\nsurvival in these patients  35  Although the clinical significance of CTCs in patients with early\nstage breast cancer  28 36  was not found using the CK+CD45− criterion  similar studies using\n\nLu et al  Page 11\n\nInt J

molecular assays  7 8  showed encouraging clinical correlations  The\ndetection of CTCs by PCR using CK19 and MGB1 mRNA before adjuvant chemotherapy\npredicts poor disease-free survival in women with early breast cancer  7  Also  the detection\nof CTCs by PCR using stanniocalcin-1  STC-1  N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase\n GalNacT  and melanoma antigen gene family-A3  MAGE-A3  offers a novel means to assess\nthe presence of systemic disease spreading relative to lymph node status  8  Although the\ncellular origin of these mRNAs remains unknown  their findings that high blood mRNAs\ncorrelate with poor disease-free survival and lymph node status are similar to ours using the\ncellular assay  Nevertheless  CTCs can be reliably detected by the use of multiple mRNA\nmarkers  as used in these molecular assays \n\nIn summary  the CAM method is unique in the CTC field for the detection of epithelial and\ntumor progenitor cells with the invasive phenotype in blood  and it warrants further clinical\nstudies to evaluate the value of invasive CTCs in guiding therapy for patients with early stage\nbreast cancer \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed

bisphosphonates in the inhibition of tumor\nangiogenesis in breast cancer cells \n\nKeywords\nbisphosphonates  breast cancer  IGF-1  HIF-1α  VEGF  PI-3K/Akt  angiogenesis\n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is the leading cancer affecting millions of women worldwide with aggressive\nosteolytic bone metastases in the advanced diseases 1  2 and longstanding morbidity or\nskeletal complications  including bone pain  pathological fracture  hypercalcemia  spinal\ncord or nerve root compression syndrome 3\n\nBisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of inorganic pyrophosphate  containing a\nphosphorus-carbon-phosphorus  P-C-P  backbone and variable side chains that determine\nthe specific potency for inhibition of bone resorption 4 5 Bisphosphonates that lack a\nnitrogen functional group in the R2 side chain  such as clodronate  condense with an\naminoacyladenylate to form nonhydrolyzable analogues of ATP that inhibit ATP-dependent\nintracellular enzymes 6  7 On the other hand  nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates  NBPs \nsuch as pamidronate  inhibit the activity of farnesyl diphosphate synthase  a key enzyme in\nthe mevalonate pathway 6  7 Due to their potent anti-resorptive activity  some\nbisphosphonates  clodronate  pamidronate  ibandronaye  zoledronate  have emerged in\nrecent years as a highly effective therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of\nskeletal complications secondary to bone metastases 5  7  8\n\nAside from the anti-resorptive activity  bisphosphonates also exhibit potent antitumor\neffects  both in vitro and in vivo 9 via several mechanisms including inhibition of tumor cell\nadhesion to bone 10 tumor cell invasion 11 12 proliferation  survival and apoptosis 11–16 as\nwell as enhancement of the tumoricidal effect of various anti-neoplastic agents 11  17\nMoreover  bisphosphonates have been reported to suppress tumor angiogenesis by directly\nsuppressing endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation  decreasing capillary-like tube\nformation  and inhibiting the formation of blood vessels in several animal models 11  18–21\nThese findings  together with recent reports that bisphosphonates altered circulating\nangiogenic factors in metastatic breast cancer patients 22 23 suggest that bisphosphonates\nare also potent anti-angiogenic agents  However  the underlying mechanism by which\nbisphosphonates suppress tumor angiogenesis remains largely unknown \n\nCentral to cellular response to hypoxia is the increased expression and activity of hypoxia-\ninducible factor  HIF -1α  which regulates a large subset of target genes essential for cellular\nadaptation to low oxygen conditions 24  25 Under normoxic condition  HIF-1α is modified\nat the proline residues  pro564 and pro402  by prolyl hydroxylases  interacts with the von\nHippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein  VHL  a recognition component of an E3\nubiquitin-protein ligase  and is targeted for proteosomal degradation 26  27 However  under\nhypoxic condition  HIF-1α protein is stabilized through the inactivation of an oxygen-\ndependent HIF-1α-prolyl hydroxylase 26 27 and translocates to the nucleus where it\ndimerizes with HIF-1β unit  In addition to intratumoral hypoxia  HIF-1α activity is also\nfrequently upregulated in several cancers in response to a variety of non-hypoxic signals\nincluding the inactivation of several tumor suppressors such as p53  pVHL  and PTEN  the\nactivation of oncogenic pathways such as Src  HER/2  and Ha-Ras 28–30 and the\nstimulation of certain hormones  cytokines  and growth factors 31–35 and viral\noncoproteins 36  37 Cumulative evidence has indicated that almost all of the hallmarks of\n\nTang et al  Page 2\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript

studies have demonstrated the critical role of HIF-1α in breast cancer 47\ncorrelating HIF-1α levels with tumor grade  aggressiveness  metastasis  and an overall poor\nprognosis and clinical outcome in breast cancer after conventional adjuvant therapy 48  49–\n52 Increased HIF-1α activity has been shown to enhance the invasiveness and osteolytic\nbone metastases of breast cancer cells 44 53 and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic\ndrugs 54  55 Therefore  inhibition of HIF-1α activation using a variety of small molecules\ncan regulate tumor growth and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy 56  57  58 Activation of\nIGF-1 receptor  IGF-R1 -mediating signaling in breast epithelial cells leads to an increase in\ncell proliferation  invasion/migration  a decrease in apoptosis  and resistance to\nantineoplastic agents 59–62 suggesting that IGF-1/IGF-R1 plays an important role in\nmammary tumorigenesis  Previous studies have shown that IGF-1 can potently stimulate\nHIF-1α activity in a variety of types of cancer 33–35  63 including breast cancer cells 64  65\nThese findings suggest that IGF-1/HIF-1α pathway might be a promising molecular target\nfor chemoprevention and treatment of breast cancer \n\nIn the present study  we investigated the effects of clodronate  a non-nitrogen containing\nbisphosphonate  and pamidronate  a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate  on IGF-1-induced\nHIF-1α and VEGF gene expression in estrogen receptor  ER -positive human breast cancer\ncells  MCF-7  We found that both clodronate and pamidronate specifically inhibited IGF-1-\ninduced HIF-1α protein level by accelerating its protein degradation  In addition \nbisphosphonates suppressed VEGF expression in MCF-7 cells by interfering with PI-3K/\nAKT/mTOR signaling pathways  Functionally  these bisphosphonates abrogated IGF-1-\nstimulated formation of capillary tube-like structures in vitro and tumor angiogenesis in\nvivo  These results suggest a potent

determine whether pamidronate and clodronate inhibit IGF-1-induced VEGF expression\nin MCF-7 cells  we examined VEGF mRNA expression and protein production in the\nconditioned media by RT-PCR and

human VEGF promoter followed by treatment with various concentrations of\npamidronate or clodronate  and IGF-1 for 16 hours  Our results showed that IGF-1\nremarkably enhanced VEGF promoter activities  Fig  2d  P<0 01  which are abrogated by\nboth pamidronate and clodronate in a concentration-dependent manner  Fig  2d  There\nappeared no obvious changes in cell morphology and toxicity in MCF-7

studies have shown that the PI-3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are\ninvolved in IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation and VEGF expression 63  68 Here \nwe also found IGF-1 stimulated Akt

pretreatment with PD98059  a specific\ninhibitor of ERK1/2  showed no obvious effects on IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein\naccumulation and VEGF protein secretion  data not shown \n\nPrevious studies have shown that IGF-1-mediated activation of PI-3K/Akt is essential to\nregulate HIF-1α protein synthesis via activation of several protein translational regulators \nincluding mTOR  p70S6K  and 4E-BP1 63  68 Thus  we next investigated the effects of\nbisphosphonates on the protein translational machinery  Our results showed that IGF-1\nstimulated activation of mTOR  p70S6K  and 4E-BP1 in MCF-7 cells in a time-dependent\nmanner  Fig  3a  and treatment with pamidronate or clodronate strikingly inhibited IGF-1-\ninduced activation of mTOR  p70S6K  and 4E-BP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner\n Fig  3b  Consistent with above findings  clodronate demonstrated a stronger inhibitory\neffect on IGF-1-induced activation of mTOR and 4E-BP-1 than pamidronate\n Supplementary Fig  2b and 2d  To further confirm these results  we pretreated serum-\nstarved MCF-7 cells with rapamycin  a specific inhibitor of mTOR  followed by exposure to\nIGF-1 for 16 hours  As expected pretreatment with rapamycin significantly suppressed\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation  Fig  3c  and VEGF secretion  Fig  3e \nP<0 01  Collectively  these results suggest that pamidronate and clodronate inhibited\nIGF-1-induced HIF-1α accumulation and its downstream target gene  VEGF  possibly by\ninterfering with PI-3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways that play a pivotal role in the protein\ntranslational machinery 29  31  39  46\n\nBisphosphonates inhibited IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation in MCF-7 cells by\npromoting HIF-1α protein degradation\n\nTo further explore the molecular mechanisms whereby pamidronate and clodronate inhibit\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation  we observed their effects on the degradation\nkinetic of HIF-1α protein in response to IGF-1 stimulation in MCF-7 cells  To this end \nserum-starved MCF-7 cells were exposed to IGF-1 for 16 hours followed by treatment with\nCHX to block ongoing protein synthesis in the presence or absence of bisphosphonates for\ndifferent time periods  Our results showed that pamidronate and clodronate promoted the\ndegradation of IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein as compared with that treated with CHX alone\n Fig  4 b & 4c versus Fig 4a  The estimated half-lives of IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein are\n25 45 min and 37 48 min in MCF-7 cells treated with pamidronate and clodronate \nrespectively  as compared to 83 01 min in the absence of bisphosphonates  whereas\npamidronate appeared to have a stronger effect in promoting the degradation rate than\nclodronate  Fig  4d  These findings indicate that pamidronate and clodronate reduce IGF-1-\ninduced HIF-1α protein accumulation  at least in part  by accelerating its degradation or\nreducing its stability in MCF-7 cells \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that HIF-1α protein is rapidly degraded under normoxic\nconditions mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome system26  27 and the accumulation rate of\nHIF-1α protein due to proteasomal inhibition indirectly reflects the synthesis rate of the\nprotein 26  56–58 To determine whether bisphosphonates could also affect the synthesis of\nHIF-1α protein  experiments with the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 were performed\nas previously described56–58  To this end  MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 20 µmol/L of\nMG-132 for 30 min followed by incubation with IGF-1 for 6 hours in the presence or\nabsence of pamidronate or clodronate  Our results showed that in the absence of IGF-1 \ntreatment with MG132 alone led to an increase in the ubiquitinated fraction of HIF-1α\nprotein  but only a slight increase in the 120 kDa HIF-1α protein level  Fig  4e  lane 2  As\npostulated  the increased levels of the newly synthesized 120 kDa HIF-1α protein induced\nby IGF-1 significantly

whether the IGF-1 induced\nangiogenic effect would be suppressed by treatment with bisphopshonates  Our data showed\nthat pretreatment with 50µmol/L of pamidronate or clodronate abrogated tubule formation in\nboth IGF-1 treated or untreated conditioned media exposed endothelial cells  Fig  5a  panels\nV and VI vs IV  Fig  5b \n\nTo further determine the effect of bisphosphonates on MCF-7 cells-induced tumor\nangiogenesis in vivo  we performed Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in nude mice  a\ncommonly used in vivo model to test the antiangiogenic effects of compounds or drugs 66\nOur results showed that Matrigel plugs mixed with the untreated conditioned medium did\nnot induce angiogenesis  Fig  6a-I  showing barely detectable or low hemoglobin levels\n Fig  6b  However  stimulation with IGF-1 greatly enhanced MCF-7 cell tumor\nangiogenesis  Fig  6a-V vs Fig  6a-II  shown here as a 20-fold higher hemoglobin levels in\nthe angiogenic plugs as compared to control  P < 0 01  Fig  6b  In addition  our results\nindicated that treatment of MCF-7 cells with clodronate significantly abrogated IGF-1-\nstimulated tumor angiogenesis  Fig  6a-VI vs Fig  6a-V  and dramatically decreased the\nhemoglobin levels  P < 0 01  Fig  6b  but had no obvious effect on unstimulated tumor\ninduced blood vessel formation  Fig  6a-V and Fig  6b  We also found that IGF-1\nsignificantly increased HIF-1α protein expression in MCF-7 xenografts  Fig  6c-III vs Fig \n6c-I  which was drastically attenuated in the presence of clodronate  Fig  6c-IV vs Fig  6c-\nIII  Similar findings were observed in MCF-7 cells treated with pamidronate  data not\nshown  Taken together  our results indicated that clodronate and pamidronate exert their\nanti-angiogenic effects possibly via disrupting HIF-1α/VEGF pathway that plays an\nimportant role in tumor angiogenesis 25  35  43  66\n\nDiscussion\nNumerous studies have suggested that IGF-1/IGF-1R-mediated activation of downstream\nsignaling pathways play an important role in mammary tumorigenesis and progression of\nbreast cancer 59–62 However  due to the heterogeneity of breast tumor cells  either ER-\npositive or ER-negative  response to IGF-1 stimulated growth varies with cell types59  It\nappears that the altered response to IGF-1 stimulation might be due to the different\nexpression levels of IGF-1-associated signaling molecules  For instance  previous studies\nhave demonstrated that ER-positive IGF-1-responsive breast cancer cells  like MCF-7 \nexpress relatively higher levels and activation of IGF-R1 than ER-negative IGF-1-\nunresponsive breast cancer cells  like MDA-MB-468 59 Meanwhile  as compared to MDA-\nMB-468 cells  ER-positive MCF-7 cells displayed higher levels of endogenous insulin\nreceptor substrates  IRS 59 which play a central role in IGF-1/IGF-R1 activated\ndownstream signaling pathways 69 These findings provide a possible explanation that IGF-1\nsignificantly enhances HIF-1α protein accumulation in ER-positive MCF-7 cells  but not in\n\nTang et al  Page 9\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2011 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nER-negative MDA-MB-468 cells  However  further studies are required to confirm the\nunderlying mechanisms \n\nCurrent therapeutic protocol has incorporated bisphosphonates in the treatment and\nprevention of skeletal complications secondary to bone metastases in breast cancer 5–8 In\naddition to their antiresorptive effects  bisphosphonates have also been shown to have direct\nand indirect antitumor activities through a variety of mechanisms9–17  including their\npotential anti-angiogenic activities 11  18–21 However  it is of note that there are\ndiscrepancies and even controversial reports between structurally different non nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates in terms of their\nefficacy in reducing cell viability/anti-proliferation and/or apoptosis induction in cancer\ncells 12–16 For instance  several studies have shown that as compared with nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates such as pamidronate and alendronate  clodronate  a non\nnitrogen-containing bisphosphonate  displayed the least 15  16 and under certain conditions \neven no obvious 12 anti-proliferative and apoptotic inductive activity in breast cancer cells \nOn the contrary  in the present study we found that clodronate reduced the cell viability and\nabrogated IGF-1-stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells more than pamidronate\n Supplementary Figure 1  This is in consistent with a previous report by Fromigue et al that\nclodronate exhibited stronger antagonizing effects than pamidronate on the stimulatory\neffects of several growth factors  including IGF-1  on the proliferation of breast cancer cells \n13 Such discrepancies between non nitrogen-containing and nitrogen-containing\nbisphosphonates in terms of their efficacy in reducing the cell viability/anti-proliferation of\ncancer cells may possibly due to the different mechanisms of pharmacological actions7 and\ndifferent cell contexts and experimental conditions 12–16 Therefore  the detailed\nmechanisms warrant further investigation \n\nIn addition to the anti-tumoral activities of both non nitrogen-containing and nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates  accumulating evidence has shown that these compounds also\npossess potent anti-angiogenic effects both in vitro and in vivo 18–23 In agreement with\nthese findings  our present study also showed that both clodronate and pamidronate\ndramatically suppressed both in vitro and in vivo tumor angiogenesis induced by MCF-7\ncells in response to IGF-1  Fig  5  Fig  6  However  up to date the underlying molecular\nmechanisms remain largely unknown  Because VEGF  as a potent mediator of new blood\nvessel formation or angiogenesis that plays a pivotal role in the growth and metastasis of\ncancer24  25  72  can be induced either by hypoxia or non-hypoxic stimuli via\ntransactivation of the major hypoxia-responsive transcription activator  HIF-1α 28  31  63 \n68 then we further explored whether bisphosphonates could disrupt this pro-angiogenic\npathway in breast cancer cells  As postulated  we demonstrated for the first time that both\nclodronate and pamidronate indeed significantly inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation\n Fig  1  Fig  6c  and VEGF expression in ER-positive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in\nresponse to IGF-1 stimulation  Fig  2  Our findings suggest that disruption of HIF-1α/\nVEGF axis might contribute  at least in part  to the anti-angiogenic activity of\nbisphosphonates \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that a variety of small molecules and compounds inhibit\nhypoxia- or growth factor-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation through stimulating the\ndegradation and/or decreasing the synthesis rate of the protein 35  56–58 We then\ninvestigated the potential molecular mechanisms whereby pamidonate and clodronate inhibit\nIGF-1-upregulated HIF-1α protein accumulation in breast cancer cells  Firstly  we\ndemonstrated that treatment of MCF-7 cells with clodronate or pamidronate had no obvious\neffects on the expression of HIF-1α mRNA  Fig  1d  suggesting that both drugs inhibit\nHIF-1α protein accumulation at the translational and/or post-translational levels  Secondly \nwe tested whether bisphosphonates could affect the degradation of HIF-1α protein  and we\n\nTang et al  Page

both clodronate and pamidronate could significantly speed the degradation rate of\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein  whereas pamidronate appeared to possess stronger effects\nthan clodronate in this regard  Fig  4a~d  In addition  because rapid degradation of HIF-1α\nprotein occurs under normoxic conditions mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway 26 \n27 the accumulation rate of HIF-1α protein due to proteasomal inhibition indirectly reflects\nthe synthesis rate of the protein 26  56–58 We subsequently observed the effects of\nbisphosphonates on IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation in breast cells after\ntreatment with MG132  a specific proteasomal inhibitor  Our data showed that the presence\nof clodronate or pamidronate led to a dose-dependent decrease in the newly-synthesized 120\nkDa HIF-1α protein levels induced by IGF-1 in cells after proteasomal inhibition    whereas\nclodronate appeared to be more potent than pamidronate  Fig  4e and 4f  Even though\npamidronate and clodronate exhibited a different degree of efficacy in stimulating the\ndegradation and decreasing the synthesis of HIF-1α protein  the overall net inhibition of\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation caused by clodronate was more pronounced\nthan that by pamidronate  Fig  1  Such differences in the efficacy of clodronate and\npamidronate in reducing IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation may reflect their\ndifferent molecule structures and mechanisms of pharmacological actions 7  12–26\nHowever  further investigation was required to address the mechanism in detail \n\nSeveral lines of evidence have shown that an increased HIF-1α protein accumulation\ninduced by non-hypoxic stimuli such as oncogenic activation  cytokines and growth factors\nincluding IGF-1 is mainly due to an increased HIF-1α protein synthesis 28–35 whereby\nPI-3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways play a pivotal role 28  29  31  32  43  46 Then we\nalso explored whether bisphosphonates had any effect on these signaling pathways  We\nfound that bisphosphonates significantly inhibited IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of\nAKT  mTOR  p70S6K1 and 4E-BP1  Fig  3b  all of which compromise essential\ncomponents of the protein translational machinery cascades 70  71 Correspondingly \ntreatment of MCF-7 cells with wortmannin  a specific inhibitor of PI-3K  or rapamycin  a\nspecific inhibitor of mTOR  drastically inhibited IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein\naccumulation and VEGF expression  Fig  3c~3e  Collectively  these findings suggest that\nthe mechanisms by which clodronate and pamidronate inhibit IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein\naccumulation may involve  at least in part  the disruption of PI-3K/AKT/mTOR signaling\npathways and translational machineries  Recently  Han et al reported that PI-3K/Akt\npathway does not play a major role in protecting IGF-1-induced HIF-1α from degradation\nmediated by SCH66336  a farnesyltransferase inhibitor 35 Therefore  further studies are\nrequired to validate whether PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathways are directly involved in\nbisphosphonate-mediated increased degradation and reduced synthesis of IGF-1 induced\nHIF-1α protein in breast cancer cells \nIn summary  in the present study we have demonstrated  to our knowledge for the first time \nthat clodronate and pamidronate inhibited in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis mediated by\nIGF-1 stimulated breast cancer cells possibly through the inhibition of IGF-1-induced\nHIF-1α protein accumulation and VEGF expression  Meanwhile  our studies imply that the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of clodronate and pamidronate on\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation might involve simultaneous inhibition of\nHIF-1α protein synthesis and enhancement of its degradation  Therefore  our findings have\nhighlighted an important mechanism of the pharmacological action of bisphosphonates in\nthe inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer cells

2009\n\nAbstract  The safety of silicone-based implant for mammoplasty has been debated for decades  A series of anec-\ndotal case reports and a recent epidemiological case-control study have suggested a possible association between \nsilicone implant and the development of primary breast ALK1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma  ALCL  a \nrare type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma  In this report  we describe an additional case of primary breast ALK1- \nnegative ALCL in the fibrous capsule and cystic fluid of silicone breast implant in a 58 year old woman who under-\nwent breast reconstructive surgery after lumpectomy for her infiltrating breast adenocarcinoma  Morphologically \nand immunohistochemically  the lymphoma cells may be confused with recurrent infiltrating breast adenocarcino-\nma or other nonhematolymphoid malignancies  Molecular studies were needed to determine T-lineage differentia-\ntion of the malignant lymphoma cells  We will also review the case reports and case series published in the English \nliterature and discuss our current understanding of silicone implant in primary breast ALK1-negative ALCL \n\nKey words  Breast implant  silicone  anaplastic large cell lymphoma  ALK1  ALCL\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrimary breast lymphoma is uncommon  compris-\ning less than 1% of all primary breast malignan-\ncies and about 2% of all extranodal nonHodgkin \nlymphomas [1  2]  The majority of primary breast \nlymphomas are of B-cell origin  including diffuse \nlarge B-cell lymphoma  marginal zone B-cell lym-\nphoma  follicle center cell lymphoma and other \nB-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [1-3]  Primary \nbreast T-cell lymphoma is even rarer  comprising \nless than 10% of all primary breast non-Hodgkin \nlymphomas [1  2  4]  In fact  in a recent study by \nLin YC et al  there was no single case of primary \nbreast T-cell lymphoma in one of the largest series \nreported from Taiwan [5] \n\nSilicone-based implant for breast augmentation \nis primarily used in women for cosmetic purpose  \nIt has also been used in patients after lumpecto-\nmy or mastectomy for breast cancer [6]  The safe-\nty of this procedure has been debated for decades  \nparticularly its association with connective tissue \ndisorders  In the last decade or so  attention has \nbeen shifted to the long term effect of silicone \nimplant on cancer development  A single epide-\nmiological study reported an increased risk of \n\ncancer death among women with silicone breast \nimplants compared with women in the general \npopulation [7]  Several large epidemiological stud-\nies  however  have subsequently shown no evi-\ndence of increased risk of developing malignancy \nin the breast or other tissues after breast aug-\nmentation with silicone implant  perhaps with the \nexception of lung cancer [8-10]  \n\nALK1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma \n ALCL  is a rare peripheral T-cell lymphoma  \nAnecdotal case reports and a recent large retro-\nspective epidemiological case-control study from \nSweden have raised concern of silicone implant \nin the development of lymphoma [4  11-21]  Here \nwe describe another case of primary breast \nALK1-negative ALCL in association with silicone \nbreast implant and review the literature to dis-\ncuss our current understanding of silicone \nimplant in primary breast lymphomas \n\nReport of a case\n\nThe patient was a 58 year old woman with a \nhistory of small infiltrating ductal carcinoma \n less than 5 mm in maximum diameter  of her \nleft breast diagnosed in November 2002  She \n\n\n\nSilicone implant and primary breast anaplastic large cell lymphoma\n\n118 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2010 3 1 117-127\n\nstaging bone marrow biopsy was negative for \ninvolvement by malignant lymphoma or meta-\nstatic disease  She was treated with 6 cycles of \nCHOP  cyclophosphamide  adriamycin  vincris-\ntine and prednisone  and had no evidence of \ndisease 10 months after treatment  \n\nunderwent lumpectomy followed by treatment \nwith tamoxifen and cosmetic breast reconstruc-\ntive surgery with a silicone-based saline-filled \nimplant  About five and a half years following \nthe surgery  she was found to have left breast \nswelling with a painless mass  Magnetic reso-\nnance imaging  MRI  of the chest showed fluid \ncollection around her implant \n\nFine needle aspiration of the fluid around the \nbreast implant showed large atypical mono-\nnuclear cells with irregular nuclear contours and \nprominent nucleoli in a background of small lym-\nphocytes  Figure 1A  suspicious for recurrence of \nthe patient’s infiltrating ductal carcinoma  The \nimplant was then surgically removed and submit-\nted for pathological examination  The implant was \ngrossly intact surrounded by a fibrous capsule  \nSections of the cell block from the fine needle \naspiration and the fibrous capsule both demon-\nstrated the presence of large atypical mononucle-\nar cells forming cohesive clusters  Figures 1B and \n1C  again raising the diagnostic consideration of \nrecurrent breast adenocarcinoma \n\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed on \nthe cell block as well as the seroma  The  atypical \nmononuclear cells were positive for CD30  but \nnegative for CD3  CD20 and CD45  Figure 2  \nEpithelial membrane protein  EMA  was also posi-\ntive  data not shown  The malignant cells are neg-\native for keratin  AE1/AE3  S100  CD68  HMB45  \nCD5  CD79a  CD138  kappa  lambda  and ALK  \nFluorescence in situ hybridization studies with the \nALK breakapart probe was also negative for ALK \ngene rearrangement  data not shown  Even \nthough immunostain for keratin was negative  the \npossibility of recurrent breast adenocarcinoma \ncannot be completely excluded because of the \npatient’s history and lineage non-specificity of \nCD30 and EMA  Therefore  molecular studies were \nperformed and the results demonstrated mono-\nclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma \ngene without evidence of monoclonality of B cells \n Figure 3  The morphologic  immunohistochemi-\ncal and molecular findings support a diagnosis of \nALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma aris-\ning in association with silicone breast implant \nrather than  recurrent infiltrating breast cancer or \nother nonhematolymphoid malignancies  \n\nPhysical examination and computerized \n tomography scans showed no evidence of \nlymphadenopathy or organomegaly  A complete \nblood count with differential was normal  A \n\nFigure 1  Cytological and histological features \nof the primary

or without a \nmass lesion  with seroma as the most common \npresentation  This unusual presentation indi-\ncates the importance of careful pathological \nexamination of tissues removed for implant-re-\nlated complications  In implant-associated pri-\nmary breast ALCL  both sides are equally affect-\ned  which is different from the reported \npredilection for involvement of the right breast \nby other types of primary breast lymphomas  \nThe age of patients with implant-related ALCL \nranged from 24 to 87 years  and lymphoma \ndeveloped 1 to 23 years after mammo plasty sur-\ngery  Slightly more than half of the procedures \nwere performed for cosmetic reason  while the \nremainders were for breast cancer  Table 1  \n\nThe lymphoma cells in primary breast ALCL with \nor without association of silicone implant were \nmorphologically similar  The lymphoma cells \ndemonstrate bulky eosinophilic to amphophilic \ncytoplasm  and the nuclei are large and pleo-\nmorphic with vesicular chromatin and promi-\nnent nucleoli  Figure 1  Mitoses are frequently \nseen  and the proliferation index in cases \nassessed with Ki6-7 is high  >80% in the cases \nexamined  Like nodal ALCL  these cells tend to \nform cohesive sheets in the fibrous capsule of \nthe silicone implant  mimicking invasive carci-\nnoma  Horseshoe-like hallmark cells may also \nbe seen  There was no skin involvement in all \nreported cases  The lymphoma cells are also \npresent in the fluid collection surrounding the \nintact or leaky implant  \n\nImmunohistochemically  primary breast ALCL \ncells are uniformly and strongly positive for  \nCD30 with both membrane and Golgi staining \n Figure 2  and are mostly positive for EMA in the \ncases evaluated  Most cases demonstrated \nexpression of at least one T-cell marker  such as \nCD3  CD4  CD5  CD7 or CD43  a feature that can \nbe used to distinguish ALCL from recurrent infil-\ntrating breast adenocarcinoma and other non-\nhematolymphoid malignancies  TIA1  cytotoxic \ngranule protein  is positive in a subset of cases \nexamined  However  molecular studies to demon-\nstrate clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor \ngene are essential to confirm the diagnosis  \nExcept for one  all primary breast ALCL demon-\nstrated clonal rearrangement of the T-cell recep-\ntor gene in the cases analyzed  Figure 3  \nImmunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrange-\nment is not present  ALK1 expression was absent \nin all ALCL associated with silicone breast implant \n\ntissue disorders because implant recipients \nproduced autoantibodies against silicone  \n\nThe risk of developing cancer in breast and \nother tissues has been the focus of attention \nthe last decade or so because a retrospective \nepidemiological study reported a higher risk of \ncancer-related death among women with sili-\ncone breast implants compared with women in \nthe general population [7  8]  However  subse-\nquent large epidemiological studies demon-\nstrated no evidence of increased cancer risk in \nassociation with silicone breast implant  In fact  \nthe standard incidence rate for breast cancer is \nlower in silicone breast implant recipients than \nin the general population [9  10]  There might \nbe a slightly increased risk of lung cancer in the \nrecipient population  which may have been \nrelated to other factors such as history of smok-\ning and urban indwelling environment rather \nthan silicone breast mammoplasty per se  \n\nThe possible association between silicone \nimplant and primary breast nonHodgkin lympho-\nma was first suggested by Duvic et al in 1995 \n[24]  The authors reported three cases of cutane-\nous T-cell lymphoma  CTCL  in association with \nbreast implant  However  CTCL is such a common \ncutaneous lymphoma that reporting of 3 cases \namong the more than 1 million breast implant \nrecipients could have been coincidental  \n\nALK1-negative ALCL is a rare peripheral T-cell \nlymphoma and a provisional entity in the most \nrecent WHO classification of hematolymphoid \nneoplasms  The first case of ALCL in associa-\ntion with a saline-filled breast implant was \nreported by Keech and Creech in 1997 [14]  \nThe patient was 41 year-old white female who \ndeveloped ALCL 5 years after cosmetic silicone \nbreast augmentation for postpartum mammary \nhypoplasia  ALK1 expression was not described  \nShe was successfully treated with chemothera-\npy without evidence of recurrent disease  \nAmong the 30 cases of primary breast ALCL \nreported in the English literature so far  22 of \nthem were associated with silicone-based \nimplant  including the case reported here and \none large series from Sweden  Table 1  \n\nPrimary breast lymphoma typically presents with \na mass lesion  including primary breast ALCL not \nassociated with silicone implant  Most patients \nwith primary breast ALCL associated with sili-\ncone implant  however  presented

is unknown  Chemotherapy \nfor breast cancer has been shown to increase \nthe risk of secondary cancer development  \nsuch as Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloid neo-\nplasm  Less than half of the silicone-associated \nprimary breast ALK1-negative ALCL had the \nmammoplasty performed after lumpectomy or \nmastectomy of breast cancer  It is unlikely that \nthese lymphomas are due to chemotherapy for \nthe underlying breast cancer  Silicone has been \nshown to incite chronic inflammatory response \nwith production of autoantibodies  Since  chronic \ninflammation has been associated with devel-\nopment of malignant lymphomas  such as H  \npylori infection in gastric extranodal marginal \nzone lymphoma and hepatitis C infection in \nmarginal zone B-cell lymphoma  it is possible \nthat chronic inflammatory stimulation may be \nrelated to the increased risk of development of \nprimary breast ALK1-negative ALCL in silicone \nimplant recipients  \n\nIt should be noted the wide range of odds ratio in \nthe retrospective case control study by de Jong \net al [23]  5 of the 11 primary breast ALK1-\nnegative ALCLs had no history of silicone breast \nimplantation [23]  One of the patients developed \nALCL 1 year after cosmetic implantation  These \nfacts also raise the possibility of random asso-\nciation between silicone implant and primary \nbreast ALK1-negative ALCL  Further studies are \nnecessary to confirm or repute the causal asso-\nciation between silicone implant and primary \nbreast ALK1-negative ALCL  Laboratory investi-\ngation is also needed to identify the underlying \nmolecular mechanism  particularly the role of \nchronic inflammatory stimulation in lymphom-\nagenesis  if the association does exist \n\nPlease address all correspondences to

immunohistochemical stains \nand  in a few cases  by cytogenetic techniques \nincluding fluorescence in situ hybridization  \n\nClinical follow-up was available in only about \nhalf of the patients with primary breast ALCL \nassociated with silicone implant  Table 1  Most \nof these patients received chemotherapy with \nor without radiation therapy  Some patients \nwere followed with observation only after remov-\nal of the seroma and silicone implant  Except for \none with recurrent disease 12 months later  all \npatients were in remission without disease dur-\ning the follow-up period  suggesting a relatively \nindolent disease of primary breast ALCL associ-\nated with silicone implant  \n\nALCL with secondary breast involvement has \nalso been reported  Talwalkar et al described 2 \nALK1-negative ALCL with secondary involve-\nment of the breast [2]  One patient had a history \nof lymphomatoid papulosis and classical \nHodgkin lymphoma  When breast involvement \nwas diagnosed  the patient had systemic involve-\nment of skin  lung  lymph node and bone \n marrow  The patient died 36 months after the \ndiagnosis  The second patient had a history of \ncutaneous ALCL before developing ALK1-\nnegative ALCL of the breast  She was alive with-\nout evidence of disease with 5 months of follow-\nup  Interestingly  both cases were associated \nwith silicone breast implant  They also reported \n4 cases of ALK1-positive ALCL with secondary \nbreast involvement  and none of these 4 cases \nwere in association with breast implant  \n\nThough primary breast lymphomas are most \ncommonly of B-cell origin  only three B cell lym-\nphomas have been described in association \nwith breast implant  These are follicular lympho-\nma [25]  primary effusion lymphoma [26]  and \nlymphoplasmacytic lymphoma [27]  There was \nno single case report of primary breast diffuse \nlarge B-cell lymphoma arising in association \nwith breast implant  If the association between \nsilicone implant and primary breast lymphoma \nis by chance alone  one would expect to observe \nmore primary breast B cell lymphomas than pri-\nmary breast ALK1-negative ALCL in association \nwith silicone mammoplasty since silicone \nimplant has been widely used and ALK-negative \nALCL is such an uncommon lymphoma \n\nIt appears that silicone implant may play a role \nin the development of

human papillomavirus\n HPV  and cervical cancer  two new approaches for the prevention of cervical cancer have\nemerged  1  HPV vaccination for primary HPV prevention in younger women and 2 \ncarcinogenic HPV detection for secondary prevention via identifying and treating cervical\nprecancer and early cancers  Both have demonstrated high degrees of efficacy with\nmaximum effectiveness guided by an understanding of the causal model and application of\nthese technologies in an age-appropriate manner  1  Despite the advent of these promising\nprevention tools  there is a real need to develop non-surgical methods for treating cervical\nprecancerous lesions and even early cancer for three reasons  First  current HPV vaccines\nare prophylactic and do not treat pre-existing HPV infections  1  Second  surgical excision\nof screen-detected precancerous lesions  while a highly efficacious  90–95%  treatment  1 \nincreases the risk of preterm delivery and infant morbidity and mortality  2  Third  most\nwomen who screen positive by a Pap and/or HPV do not have clinically-actionable disease \nyet these women are at risk of cervical precancer and cancer in the future and must be\nfollowed-up intensively  Finally  in the low-resource settings  surgical methods are not\ncommonly available and cryotherapy  while moderately efficacious when its use is limited to\nsmaller lesions  causes significant watery discharge and requires sexual abstinence for\nseveral weeks to permit healing of treated epithelium \n\nDespite the knowledge that HPV infection is the obligate cause of cervical cancer  targeted\nimmunological approaches for therapy such as therapeutic vaccines have been unsuccessful\n 3  Chung and Lambert  4  present a novel approach of using estrogen receptor antagonists\n selective estrogen receptor modulators or SERMs  to treat cervical precancer and cancer \nAs noted by the authors  there are strongly supportive laboratory  5  and epidemiological\ndata  6 7  that estrogen plays contributing role in cervical carcinogenesis  In this study \nChung and Lambert  4  successfully treated 7 E6/E7 transgenic mice that spontaneously\nmanifested cervical cancer with Raloxifene  an estrogen receptor antagonist that reduces the\nrisk of breast cancer \n\nTo investigate whether Raloxifene might the incidence of cervical cancer and its immediate\nprecursor  carcinoma in situ  CIS  previously unpublished data on these outcomes from two\nrandomized clinical trials to evaluate two SERMs  tamoxifen and raloxifene  for

prevention trials  Breast Cancer Prevention Trial P-1  BCPT-P1   8  and\nStudy of Tamoxifen vs  Raloxifene  STAR   9  While both tamoxifen and raloxifene are\nestrogen receptor antagonists in breast tissue  raloxifene is an estrogen receptor antagonist\nwhile tamoxifen is an agonist in the human reproductive tract  e g  Tamoxifen increases the\nrisk of endometrial cancer while raloxifene does not   4 10 11  However  as shown in the\nTable  despite small numbers  there was no evidence that long-term raloxifene use reduces \nor long-term tamoxifen use increases  the risk of cervical CIS and

in breast cancer  The 78-kD\nglucose-regulated protein  GRP78  is a potent anti-apoptotic factor  conferring drug resistance \nRecently  we reported that high GRP78 expression in breast cancer specimens predict a shorter\nrecurrence-free survival in patients who received doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy \nInterestingly  the opposite effect was observed in 25 patients who additionally received a taxane \nTo confirm this potentially paradigm shifting finding  we investigated whether GRP78 is\nassociated with recurrence-free survival in an independent cohort of taxane-treated breast cancer\npatients  Immunohistochemical staining of GRP78 was performed on archival paraffin-embedded\nformalin-fixed tumor specimens obtained from 48 female breast cancer patients before\nchemotherapy treatment  These patients received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide  followed by\npaclitaxel or docetaxel on a clinical trial  GRP78 expression level was evaluated by a pathologist \nmasked to all clinical and outcome data  Association between GRP78 expression and recurrence-\nfree survival was evaluated  GRP78 positivity predicts a better recurrence-free survival \nindependent of other prognostic factors [hazard ratio  HR  for moderate positivity  0 40  95%\nconfidence interval  CI  0 087–1 83  HR for strong positivity  0 16  95% CI  0 018–1 50 \nPtrend=0 053]  In a pooled analysis with the previous 25 patients  almost identical HRs were\nobtained with Ptrend=0 024  This provides further evidence that GRP78 is a potential independent\npredictor for response to taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer \n\nIntroduction\nApproximately 182 000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the US 1 Over\n90% are found at an early stage without distant

improved patient survival 4  5 Currently  prognostic factors\nincluding patient age  tumor stage  and estrogen receptor status are used to decide the need\nof adjuvant chemotherapy 6 However  there are few predictive markers of benefit from\ntaxane-containing adjuvant chemotherapy  One candidate marker is HER2 in which\npositivity was shown to predict benefit from addition of paclitaxel to doxorubicin treatment7\nalthough these results may not be applicable given the current targeted treatment for HER2-\npositive breast cancer  ie  trastuzumab \n\nThe 78-kD glucose-regulated protein  GRP78  also known as BiP  is a multi-functional\nCa2+ binding protein primarily residing in the endoplasmic reticulum controlling\nendoplasmic reticulum homeostasis  stress signaling and protein quality control 8 In vitro\nstudies established that GRP78 possesses potent anti-apoptotic properties and confers drug\nresistance to tumor cells as well as tumor associated endothelial cells 9–12 GRP78\nsuppresses doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis in part through inhibition of BAX and caspase-7\nactivation 13  14 A retrospective analysis of 127 breast cancer patients who received adjuvant\ndoxorubicin-based chemotherapy directly links GRP78 positivity to a shorter recurrence-free\nsurvival independent of other prognostic factors 15 Interestingly  an unplanned subset\nanalysis revealed that this association was reversed among patients who also received\nadjuvant taxane  n=25  such that GRP78 positivity appeared to be associated with a better\noutcome  HR=0 15  P=0 072  p for interaction=0 012  As taxanes are now widely\nprescribed as adjuvant chemotherapy 16 investigation of the predictive value of GRP78 in\nsequential doxorubicin and taxane regimens is of great importance \n\nHere we report the results of a follow-up retrospective study  designed to examine the\npredictive value of one specific marker  GRP78  in response to adjuvant doxorubicin\nfollowed by taxanes \n\nMaterial and methods\nParticipants\n\nThis study includes female patients with breast cancer who had archived prior to treatment\nformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimen in LAC+USC Medical Center and who\nreceived doxorubicin  cyclophosphamide  followed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel between\n2000 and 2002 on a clinical trial  Among the 60 patients enrolled in the trial  48 had invasive\ntumor samples that were suitable for GRP78 analysis  46 specimens were primary breast\ntumor specimens  2 specimens were from lymph node metastasis  their primary tumors were\nnot

stages of the cell cycle and have been implicated in cancer progression  Unlike its other\nfamily members the expression of Plk3 remains steady during cell cycle progression  suggesting\nthat its activity may be spatiotemporally regulated  However  the mechanism of regulation of Plk3\nactivity is not well understood  Here  we show that calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1\n CIB1  a Plk3 interacting protein  is widely expressed in various cancer cell lines  Expression of\nCIB1 mRNA as well as protein is increased in breast cancer tissue as compared to normal tissue \nCIB1 constitutively interacts with Plk3 as determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays  This\ninteraction of CIB1 with Plk3 is independent of intracellular Ca2+  Furthermore  binding of CIB1\nresults in inhibition of Plk3 kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo  Interestingly  this inhibition of\nthe Plk3 activity by CIB1 is Ca2+-dependent  Taken together  our results suggest that CIB1 is a\nregulatory subunit of Plk3 and it regulates Plk3 activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner  Furthermore \nupregulation of CIB1 in cancer cells could thus inhibit Plk3 activity leading to abnormal cell cycle\nregulation in breast cancer cells  Thus in addition to Plk3  CIB1 may be a potential biomarker and\ntarget for therapeutic intervention of breast cancer \n\nKeywords\nCIB1  calcium- and

Plk family consists of four members that have been identified in the mammalian cells \nPlk1  Plk2/Snk  Plk3/Fnk/Prk  proliferation-related kinase  and Plk4/Sak 4–8  These kinases\nare characterized by the presence of highly conserved noncatalytic domains termed polo\nboxes 9  These polo boxes are shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions and are\nrequired for subcellular localization of Plks 10  They bind to the phosphorylated serine or\nthreonine residues of the binding partners and regulate subcellular localization of Plks 10–12 \nIn addition  the C-terminus  which contains the polo boxes  is shown to be involved in\nregulation of kinase activity 13 \n\nControlled expression or activity of the Plks has been shown to regulate normal progression\nof cell cycle  Since variations in their activity or expression often leads to oncogenic\ntransformation  these protein kinases are considered to be proto-oncogenes 14  The\ndifference in their function and regulation depends on their spatiotemporal expression \nsubcellular localization  and substrate specificity 15–17  Expression of Plk1 is strongly\ncorrelated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many cancers 18–20  Reduction in Plk2\nexpression has been reported to enhance stress-induced apoptosis 21  whereas  Plk3\nexpression is shown to increase during G1 phase  but remains mostly unaltered during cell\ncycle progression 22–24  In contrast to Plk1  Plk3 expression has been negatively correlated\nwith the development of certain cancers 3  It is thus believed that regulation of Plk3 activity\nor subcellular localization may dictate its function during the cell cycle  but little is known\nabout the mechanism by which this regulation occurs \n\nUsing the yeast two-hybrid system  Plk3 was shown to interact with CIB1 16  which was\noriginally identified as a calcium- and integrin αIIb-binding protein with a sequence\nsimilarity to the regulatory molecules calcineurin B and calmodulin 25  CIB1 mRNA and\nprotein expression is widespread  including notable expression in some cancer cell lines 26 \nWe investigated the physiological relevance of interaction between Plk3 and CIB1  Here we\nshow that CIB1 is expressed in several cancer cell lines and its expression is upregulated\nduring breast cancer progression  We also show that CIB1 constitutively binds Plk3 and\ninhibits its kinase activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner  Taken together  our results suggest\nthat CIB1 acts as a regulatory subunit of Plk3  and thereby contributes to the regulation of\nthe cell cycle in a Ca2+-dependent manner \n\n2  Materials and methods\n2 1  Cell culture and transfection\n\nHuman breast carcinoma cell lines T47D  MDA-MB-468  MDA-MB-361  MDA-MB-436 \nMCF-7  and

identified as an integrin αIIb-binding protein 25  it was\nsubsequently shown that CIB1 expression is not limited to platelet-specific lineages  In fact \nCIB1 mRNA appears to be widely expressed 26  In order to determine whether CIB1 protein\nis expressed in breast cancer-derived cell lines  we performed Western blot analysis using\nCIB1-specific antibody  HUVEC were used as positive control where it was found to\nexpress  We found that CIB1 protein is expressed in all breast cancer cell lines tested \nEspecially  in T47D  MCF-7  MCF-10A  and MDA-MB-361 cell lines  the level of CIB1\nexpression is substantially more than that of HUVECs  Fig  1A  Equal loading of protein in\neach lane was ascertained through HSC-70 probing  We next determined the extent of CIB1\nupregulation in breast cancer tissue by probing a cDNA array in which cDNA synthesized\nfrom 9 human breast tumors and the adjacent normal tissue from each individual was used \n\nNaik et al  Page 4\n\nInt J

sensitive means for the detection and quantitation of differential gene\nexpression relevant to breast cancer  To ensure valid comparison  the manufacturers have\nindependently normalized each tumor cDNA to its matched normal sample using expression\nof three separate housekeeping genes  We found a detectable level of CIB1 message in the\nnormal tissue  However  all breast tumor tissues showed an increased level of CIB1 mRNA\nexpression compared to their corresponding normal tissue  Fig  1B  Quantitation of the\nexpression of CIB1 mRNA level in the tumor tissue showed an average of two-fold increase\nover the normal levels  Fig  1C  These results suggest that CIB1 mRNA expression is\nupregulated in breast cancer tissue \n\n3 2  CIB1 protein expression is upregulated in breast tumor\nIncreased expression of the CIB1 message in breast cancer tissue and a variety of breast\ncarcinoma cell lines  prompted us to determine CIB1 protein expression in normal and\ntumorigenic breast tissue  Commercially available tumor and normal breast tissue sections\nwere immunohistochemically stained using anti-CIB1 antibody  H&E staining of the normal\nbreast tissue section showed typical glandular morphology and mammary epithelial cell\nlining  Fig  2Ai  In normal breast epithelium tissue  CIB1 localized along the cell\nmembrane of glandular epithelial cells as was expected for a myristoylated protein  Fig \n2Aii  Interestingly  in tumor tissue  CIB1 expression appears to be upregulated  and\nlocalized throughout the cell  not just restricted to the membrane of the glandular epithelial\ncells  Fig  2Aiii  This is not surprising since CIB1 is known to function as a myristoyl\nswitch 30  No staining was observed when isotype-specific control antibody was used \nsuggesting that the anti-CIB1 staining is highly specific  Fig  2Aiv  Comparison of pixel\nintensities of the images captured at identical laser power indicated a significant increase in\nCIB1 expression in tumors compared to normal breast tissue  Fig  2Av \n\nIn order to assess the expression of CIB1 during breast cancer progression  a tissue array\ncontaining samples of various pathological grades assigned by the manufacturer were\nimmunohistochemically stained with anti-CIB1  An isotype specific control IgG had no\nstaining as expected  Fig  2Bi  Adjacent tissue 1 5 cm away from the tumor showed low\nstaining for CIB1  Fig  2Bii  Interestingly  tumor tissue of increasing grade showed\nincreased level of expression of CIB1  Fig  2Biii–v  Quantification of mean fluorescence\nintensity as a measure of CIB1 expression indicated a significant increase in CIB1\nexpression in various grades of breast tumors compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissue\n Fig  2Bvi  To verify the increase in CIB1 expression is indeed in proliferating tumor cells\nthe sections were double stained for CIB1 and Ki67  a proliferation specific marker  We\nfound that CIB1 and Ki67 colocalized confirming the increased expression of CIB1 in tumor\ncells  Fig  2C  Taken together  these results suggest that CIB1 expression is increased\nduring breast cancer progression \n\n3 3  Plk3 interacts with CIB1 in vivo and in vitro\nIt has been shown previously through the yeast two-hybrid assay that CIB1 and Plk3 interact\n16  Due to the established role of Plk3 in cell cycle progression  and the known expression of\nPlk3 and CIB1 in a number of cancer cell lines  including T47D  it was apparent that the\ninteraction between Plk3 and CIB1 might play a role in cancer progression  To determine\ntheir in vivo interaction in a breast cancer cell line  we performed a coimmunoprecipitation\nassay from T47D cell-lysates using well-characterized  highly-specific antibodies  Plk3 was\ncoimmunoprecipitated with CIB1 by anti-CIB1  but not by an isotype-specific control IgG\n cIgG   Fig  3A  This was further confirmed in a reciprocal immunoprecipitation\nexperiment where CIB1 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Plk3  suggesting that a specific\ninteraction occurs between CIB1 and Plk3 in vivo  Fig  3A  Although  the antibodies used\nwere shown to be specific to CIB1 25  27 and Plk3 23  we further confirmed the specificity of\n\nNaik et al  Page 5\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 February 1

down-\nregulating Plk3 in T47D cells using Plk3 specific shRNA  respectively  We found that in\nCHO cells anti-CIB1 does not recognize any band  but in CIB1 overexpressing cells\nrecognizes a 22kDa band corresponding to human CIB1  Fig  3B  In T47D cells  anti-Plk3\nshows down-regulation of Plk3 by Plk3-specific shRNA  Fig  3C \n\nCoimmunoprecipitation of endogenous CIB1 with Plk3 and vice versa does not determine\nwhether they interact directly or indirectly through other proteins being part of a multi-\nprotein complex  To address this  we generated and purified recombinant Plk3 and CIB1\nproteins  and performed an in vitro solid-phase binding assay  We found that Plk3 bound to\nimmobilized CIB1 in a concentration dependent and saturable manner  demonstrating a\nphysical interaction between the two proteins  Fig  3D  The approximate KD of 2 6 ± 0 5\nnM calculated from the above binding data indicate that these proteins bind with a very high\naffinity  This is consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data reported previously 16  These\nfindings further suggest that the interaction of CIB1 with Plk3 does not require any post-\ntranslational modifications such as phosphorylation since the recombinant CIB1 protein\nused was produced in bacteria \n\n3 4  Plk3 interacts with CIB1 both in the absence and the presence of Ca2+\n\nBecause CIB1 is known to bind Ca2+ 25  we asked if its interaction with Plk3 is regulated by\nCa2+ in vivo  To test this  we repeated the coimmunoprecipitation experiment using lysates\nof cells pre-treated with or without BAPTA-AM to chelate endogenous Ca2+  Plk3 readily\ncoimmunoprecipitated with CIB1 in the absence of BAPTA-AM treatment  Fig  4A  The\npresence of BAPTA-AM greatly affected the amount of CIB1 immunoprecipitated  possibly\ndue to reduced affinity of the antibody for apo-CIB1  Fig  4A  The expression of Plk3 was\nnot affected by Ca2+ chelation  Fig  4A input  It appeared at first that reduced amount of\nPlk3 in the CIB1 immunoprecipitate of BAPTA-treated cell lysate was due to the reduced\ninteraction with CIB1  However  when normalized to the total immunoprecipitated CIB1  a\nsignificantly greater amount of Plk3 was coimmunoprecipitated  indicating that an increased\namount of Plk3 bound to CIB1  Fig  4B  This suggested a possibility that CIB1 may\ninteract with Plk3 both in the presence and the absence of Ca2+ \n\nTo further determine whether the binding affinity between CIB1 and Plk3 is altered in the\npresence of Ca2+  we performed an in vitro binding assay in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA \nWe used purified recombinant Plk3 and CIB1 proteins in this assay  To our surprise  we\nfound that CIB1 bound Plk3 in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+ with slightly\nbetter binding in the latter condition  Fig  4C  These results suggest that CIB1 is\nconstitutively bound to Plk3 and thus may function as a regulatory subunit of Plk3 \n\n3 5  Recombinant Plk3 activity was inhibited by purified recombinant CIB1 in a Ca2+-\ndependent manner\n\nWe determined the effect of CIB1 interaction on Plk3 kinase activity in an in vitro kinase\nassay  We first ascertained that the recombinant Plk3 is pure and active  We also excluded\nthe possibility that some other kinases were present as a contaminant and contributing to the\nobserved activity by showing that recombinant kinase-dead Plk3 prepared similarly does not\nshow any activity in this assay 31  Interestingly  recombinant Plk3 activity was inhibited\nupon addition of purified recombinant CIB1  Fig  5A  Densitometric quantitation of the\nband intensity from at least three separate experiments indicated a five-fold decrease in\nkinase activity that was statistically significant  Fig  5B  This inhibition of Plk3 activity was\nfound to be dependent on the concentration of CIB1 added  data not shown \n\nNaik et al  Page 6\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 February 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

in this inhibition  We found that Ca2+-bound CIB1 inhibited Plk3 activity \nwhereas apo-CIB1  obtained by extensive dialysis of recombinant CIB1 in the presence of\nEGTA  had no effect  Fig  5C  The inability of apo-CIB1 to block kinase activity is not due\nto misfolding caused by the removal of Ca2+  since the circular dichroism spectrum of apo-\nand Ca2+-bound CIB1 were identical  data not shown  This was further confirmed by that\nfact that addition of Ca2+ to apo-CIB1 reestablished its ability to inhibit Plk3 activity  Fig \n5C  indicating that CIB1 regulates Plk3 activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner \n\n3 6  Ectopic overexpression of CIB1 in T47D cells attenuates Plk3 activity\nTo delineate if CIB1 inhibits Plk3 activity in vivo  we first investigated the endogenous level\nof CIB1 expression in T47D cells  Western blot analysis showed that a detectable amount of\nCIB1 expression is endogenous to this cell line  Fig  6A  as had been reported previously\n26  In order to overexpress CIB1  we transfected these cells with a CIB1-pcDNA construct \nThe cells transfected with CIB1 showed a several-fold higher level of CIB1 expression  as\ncompared to mock cells transfected with an empty vector as a control  Fig  6A and B  To\ndetermine that CIB1 inhibited Plk3 activity in vivo  we immunoprecipitated Plk3 from\nmock- and CIB1-transfected T47D cell lysates and performed an immunoprecipitate kinase\nassay  In agreement with our in vitro data  under similar amounts of immunoprecipitation \nPlk3 from mock-transfected cells had greater activity than Plk3 from CIB1-transfected cells\n Fig  6C  Quantification of data from several experiments suggested a significant decrease\nin Plk3 activity in the immunoprecipitates of CIB1-overexpressing cell lysates  Fig  6D \nTaken together  these results suggest that CIB1 is a regulatory subunit of Plk3 and it\nregulates Plk3 activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner \n\nDiscussion\nIn the present study  we sought to determine the physiological relevance of the interaction\nbetween Plk3 and CIB1 in breast cancer progression  We found that CIB1 mRNA as well as\nprotein is upregulated in various cancer cell lines  and in particular breast cancer tissues \nCIB1 expression appears to be increased during breast cancer progression  Our results\nfurther demonstrate that CIB1 constitutively binds to Plk3 and inhibits Plk3 activity in a\nCa2+-dependent manner  Taken together  these results provide evidence that CIB1 is a\nregulatory subunit of Plk3 and may be involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of this\nimportant tumor suppressor \n\nCIB1 has been shown to interact with Plk2 and Plk3  two of the members of polo-like kinase\nfamily 16  Here we show that CIB1 interacts with Plk3 in the presence and the absence of\nCa2+  but inhibits Plk3 activity only in the presence of Ca2+  Consistent with our results  it\nhas recently been shown that CIB1 also inhibits Plk2 activity in Cos-7 cells 17  It is possible\nthat CIB1  a calcium-binding protein  is activated upon a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and\ninhibits these kinases  Polo-like kinase family members are characterized by the presence of\na highly conserved polo box  a motif involved in protein-protein interactions  which has\nbeen shown to be important for the physiological function of these kinases 32  It has been\nshown that in addition to its kinase activity  the C-terminus of Plk3 is also important for its\nfunction  because overexpression of Plk3 or its kinase-dead mutant induces chromatin\ncondensation and apoptosis 33  This phenomenon seems to be dependent on Plk3′s C-\nterminal half  where the strictly-conserved polo box domains are situated  because\noverexpression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of Plk3 failed to induce cell death 33 \nRecently  it has been shown that the polo box functions as a specific phosphoserine or\nphosphothreonine binding domain and is involved in the localization of the kinase to the\ncentrosome 32  It is also known that the polo box is important for the subcellular localization\nof polo-like kinase family members 10  and it is interesting to note that CIB1 has been\n\nNaik et

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nshown to bind to the polo box of Plk3 possibly in a phosphorylation independent manner 16 \nIt is therefore possible that binding of CIB1 to Plk3 not only inhibits its activity  but may\nalso regulate its subcellular localization \n\nPlk3 expression is consistently downregulated in several carcinomas 7  34  It is thus\nhypothesized that Plk3 plays the role of a safeguard gene in controlling normal cell division \nand that its downregulation in carcinomas leads to compromised cell division  Plk3 has also\nbeen shown to phosphorylate the tumor suppressor protein  p53 on serine-20 resulting in its\nactivation 35  Thus inhibition or downregulation of Plk3 may lead to tumor progression \nConsistent with this notion it has been recently shown that genetic ablation of Plk3 results in\nspontaneous development of tumors in mice underscoring its function as a tumor suppressor\n36 \n\nExpression of Plk3 is rapidly induced upon exposure of serum-starved cells to growth\nfactors  implicating Plk3 in the regulation of cell proliferation 7  Unlike other members of\nthe polo-like kinase family  Plk3 expression levels remain rather constant during the normal\ncell cycle 37 except that it is slightly upregulated during the G1 phase 24  However  in head \nneck  and lung carcinomas  it has been shown that Plk3 levels are significantly\ndownregulated  contrasting that of another family member  Plk1 7  34  38  It is thus possible\nthat Plk3 activity is required for normal cell division in such precursor cells  and that its\ndownregulation may aid to cancer development  How Plk3 activity is regulated during the\ncell cycle in normal cells where Plk3 is substantially expressed is still not clear  However \nour finding that CIB1 inhibits Plk3 kinase activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner may provide\nsuch an explanation  Further experimentation will be necessary to address this possibility \n\nTaken together  our results suggest that CIB1 is a regulatory subunit of Plk3  and it affects\nthe activity of Plk3 in a Ca2+-dependent manner  Thus  during the normal cell cycle  Plk3\nactivity may be regulated by the level of CIB1 and an unwanted change in the expression of\neither may be a key determinant in the transformation from the normal to the malignant\nphenotype  making Plk3 and CIB1 potential targets for therapeutic intervention

Radiology  University of Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh  PA  USA\n\nObjectives  To investigate the feasibility of converting a computer–aided detection\n CAD  scheme for digitised screen–film mammograms to full-field digital mammograms\n FFDMs  and assessing CAD performance on a large database \nMethods  The database included 6478 FFDM images acquired on 1120 females  with\n525 cancer cases and 595 negative cases  The database was divided into five case\ngroups   1  cancer detected during screening   2  interval cancers   3  ‘‘high-risk’’\nrecommended for surgical excision   4  recalled but negative and  5  negative  not\nrecalled  A previously developed CAD scheme for masses depicted on digitised images\nwas converted and re-optimised for FFDM images while keeping the same image-\nprocessing structure  CAD performance was analysed on the entire database \nResults  The case-based sensitivity was 75 6%  397/525  for the current mammograms\nand 40 8%  42/103  for the prior mammograms deemed negative during clinical\ninterpretation but ‘‘visible’’ during retrospective review  The region-based sensitivity\nwas 58 1%  618/1064  for the current mammograms and 28 4%  57/201  for the prior\nmammograms  The CAD scheme marked 55 7%  221/397  and 35 7%  15/42  of the\nmasses on both views of the current and the prior examinations  respectively  The\noverall CAD-cued false-positive rate was 0 32 per image  ranging from 0 29 to 0 51 for\nthe five case groups \nConclusion  This study indicated that  1  digitised image-based CAD can be\nconverted for FFDMs while performing at a comparable  or better  level   2  CAD\ndetects a substantial fraction of cancers depicted on prior examinations  albeit most\nhaving been marked only on one view  and  3  CAD tends to mark more false-positive\nresults on ‘‘difficult’’ negative cases that are more visually difficult for radiologists to\ninterpret \n\nReceived 15 June 2010\nRevised 6 September 2010\nAccepted 13

and\nused clinically as a ‘‘second reader’’ to assist radiologists\nin interpreting mammograms  These CAD systems pro-\ncess digitised or digital images and cue  mark  suspicious\nregions that may depict specific abnormalities  i e  masses\nand/or microcalcification clusters  The second reader\napproach emphasises that radiologists should first read\nand interpret mammograms without CAD followed by\nthe viewing of the CAD results to help highlight the\nregions that were missed and/or underestimated in their\nimportance prior to making a final recommendation  A\nnumber of studies have assessed the impact of using\nCAD on radiologists’ performances when interpreting\nmammograms [1–6]  Some studies have shown that\nradiologists detected more cancers associated with micro-\ncalcifications when using CAD for both screen–film\nmammograms  SFMs  [1] and full-field digital mammo-\ngrams  FFDMs  [6]  while other studies have shown that\nthe use of CAD had little impact on both cancer detection\nand recall rates of the radiologists [2]  or even reduced\n\nradiologists’ performances as measured by the areas\nunder the receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curves\n[5]  Although there is no universal agreement of the actual\nbenefit  if any  when using CAD  in terms of performance\nimprovement [7]  the objective assessment of CAD\nperformance alone is important and has scientific merit \nOur own previous study demonstrated an improvement\nin radiologists’ performances when using ‘‘highly per-\nforming’’ CAD  whereas radiologists’ performances actu-\nally reduced when using ‘‘poorly performing’’ CAD with\nhigh false-positive cueing rates [8] \nA number of previous studies have assessed the per-\n\nformances of commercialised CAD systems alone using\ndifferent image databases [9–15]  Among these  several\nstudies assessed the performances of CAD systems for\nFFDM images  One study reported an 89%  32/36  case-\nbased sensitivity at 0 29 false-positive mass cues per\nimage using the ImageChecker M1000-DM system  v 3 1 \nHologic Inc  Bedford  MA  [13]  and another study re-\nported a 92%  57/62  case-based sensitivity at an overall\nfalse-positive rate of 0 58 per image  including both false-\npositive mass and microcalcification cluster cues  using\nthe SecondLook system  v 7 2  iCAD Inc  Nashua  NH \n[14]  Recently  Sadaf et al [15] reported the largest retro-\nspective study to evaluate CAD performance using FFDM\n\nAddress correspondence to  Dr Bin Zheng  Department of\nRadiology  University of Pittsburgh  3362

date  The database included 127 verified cancer\ncases associated with 5 different types of abnormalities \nThe CAD scheme  SecondLook v 7 2  achieved overall a\n91%  115/127  cancer detection sensitivity  or an 88%  44/\n51  sensitivity on malignant masses \nAs the majority of previously reported CAD schemes in\n\nmammographywere developed for digitised SFM images \nresearchers have also investigated the feasibility of\nconverting the CAD schemes developed for digitised\nSFM images to new CAD schemes for FFDM images and\ncomparing the performance difference between the CAD\nschemes for these two types of images [16  17]  For\nexample  one study reported that two CAD schemes with\nsimilar architecture achieved comparable performance\nlevels for the FFDM and SFM images  e g  70% sensitivity\nat 0 9 and 1 0 false-positive marks per image  by using a\ndatabase of 229 SFM and FFDM examinations depicting\n27 malignant and 104 benign masses [16]  Another study\ninvestigated the feasibility of converting an SFM-based\nCAD scheme to classify between malignant and benign\nmasses depicted on FFDM images without changing the\nstructure of the CAD scheme  Using a data set depicting\n148 malignant and 139 benign masses  the study reported\nthat there was no significant difference from the result of a\nprevious study using SFM images  with an area under the\nROC curve of 0 81 and p50 83  [17] \nDespite these research efforts and the reported high\n\nperformances  the databases used in the previous studies\n[13–17]were limited  In the assessment of CADperformance\nusing digitised SFM images  studies have shown that the\nhigher sensitivity reported in a study using a limited\ndatabase  i e  89% [9]  was often not achievable in large-scale\nassessment studies [1  11  12]  Therefore  owing to the large\nvariation of breast abnormalities and normal tissue struc-\ntures  assembling a large database that can relatively\nsufficiently represent the general screening population is\nimportant to effectively assess or predict CAD performance\nin clinical practice  In this study  we assembled a large and\nunique FFDM image database that included a series of\nmammographic examinations on the same females belong-\ning to one of five categories  groups  and converted our in-\nhouse developed CAD scheme for SFM images into a new\nscheme for FFDM images  An assessment of the CAD\nperformance levels on the entire FFDM image database and\neach of the five case groups  at an operating level similar to\nthat previously used to assess commercial CAD schemes for\nSFM images [12]  is described herein \n\nMethods and materials\n\nThe FFDM image database\n\nUnder an institutional review board-approved proto-\ncol  we ascertained fully anonymised FFDM examinations\nfrom the clinical facilities of our medical centre and\ntransferred the images to our research facility  A group of\nresearch staff ensured that the examinations were fully\nanonymised and generated an outcome ‘‘truth file’’ for\neach of the examinations included in the database  All\nexaminations were acquired using Hologic Selenia\n Hologic Inc  FFDM systems between 2006 and 2008 \nThe honest brokers specifically selected cases that met one\nof the five groups of interest  The assembled database\n\nincluded   1  477 verified cancer cases depicting masses\nthat were detected during mammographic screening\nexamination and confirmed by the followed diagnostic\nwork-up  Group 1   2  48 ‘‘interval’’ cancer cases depic-\nting masses that were detected in the interval between 2\nscreening examinations  Group 2   3  19 patients who had\nbeen recalled during screening for diagnostic work-up of\nmasses that were determined to be ‘‘high-risk’’ pre-cancer\ncases  e g  lobular carcinoma in situ  with surgical excision\nof lesions recommended  Group 3   4  222 patients\nrecalled for diagnostic work-up of masses that were\nultimately determined to be benign  Group 4  and  5  354\nscreening cases rated as ‘‘negative’’  no recall during\nscreening  and later verified by follow-up as negative\nexaminations  Group 5  For each selected case  the FFDM\nimages from the examination in question  as well as prior\nFFDM examinations  if available  were ascertained  After\nan automated de-identification processing to remove all\npersonal information  the images with a new assigned ID\ncode were saved on our computer network server for\naccess by the investigators  All related diagnostic infor-\nmation [e g  breast density Breast Imaging Reporting and\nData System  BI-RADS  ratings  diagnostic reports \npathology-verified abnormality types  location  staging \nage  family history etc ] was also ascertained and recorded\nin a separate code-protected database \nIn summary  the FFDM database included a total of\n\n6478 FFDM images acquired from 1120 females  cases \nAmong these  525 females were positive for cancer\n associated with malignant masses  and 595 were\nbenign or negative  In addition  669 females had only\n1 FFDM examination  namely the current examination \nwhereas 371 had 2  1 current and 1 prior  and 80 had 3  1\ncurrent and 2 prior  FFDM examinations during the period\nin question  2006–2008  In 525 verified cancer cases  136\nhad 2 examinations and 38 had 3 examinations  Thus  a\ntotal of 1651 FFDM examinations were available to this\nstudy  Among these examinations  737 had been per-\nformed on females with detected cancer  Among the 595\nnegative  or benign  cases  suspicious masses had been\ndetected in 159 cases and the diagnostic work-up resulted\nin 19 recommended operations for lesion excision  The\ndistribution of the cases in this study is summarised in\nTable 1 \nAfter assembling the FFDM image database  a three-\n\nstep process  namely a review  a verification and a final\nconfirmation  of identifying and marking the centre of the\nmass  as well as circular margins encapsulating the mass\nin question  was performed by experienced scientists and\nradiologists with the aid of information from de-identified\nsource documents provided by the honest brokers  The\nfinal confirmation was performed by an experienced\nradiologist  This information was saved as the truth file\nfor performance testing  Table 2 summarises the distribu-\ntion of the marked mass regions in three different\ncategories of cases  In this database  a total of 1673 mass\nregions of interest were marked  including 1265 regions\nassociated with cancer and 408 associated with benign\nmasses  In the retrospective review  201 mass regions\nassociated with 103 cancer cases were marked on the\nimages acquired from the prior examinations of these\ncases that had been either missed or interpreted as\nnegative during the original screening \n\nB Zheng  J H Sumkin  M L Zuley et al\n\ne154 The British Journal of Radiology  June 2012\n\n\n\nThe computer-aided detection scheme\n\nA detailed description of our CAD scheme for\ndigitised SFM images has been reported elsewhere [12 \n18]  The performance of this CAD scheme has been\ntested and compared with two leading commercial CAD\nschemes using a large independent clinical database \nComparable performance levels were achieved for all\nthree CAD schemes [12]  In this study  we first applied\nour SFM-based CAD scheme to the entire FFDM\ndatabase  We found that the sensitivity was 8 8%  46/\n525  and the false-positive rate was 0 12 per image\n 776/6478  To understand the reasons for this perfor-\nmance degradation  we randomly selected a set of FFDM\nimages depicting marked mass regions  We then visually\nexamined the CAD-generated mass boundary contours\nand analysed the recorded image features  We found that\n 1  a large fraction of the CAD-defined mass regions\ndepicted on the FFDM images were only partially\nsegmented  smaller than the visually identified region \nand  2  the pixel value-related features  i e  contrast  pixel\nvalue standard deviation  were saturated  assigned to\nthe maximum value  As the FFDM images had a\nsubstantially higher contrast resolution and a larger\npixel value variation  in absolute terms  than the\ndigitised SFM images  the previously optimised CAD\nscheme based on the SFM images was not appropriate\nfor the FFDM images  We adopted the following steps to\nconvert the CAD scheme while maintaining the same\narchitecture and the three image-processing stages \nThe first stage of the scheme uses a difference-of-\n\nGaussian filtering method to identify suspicious regions \nIn this stage  we proportionally adjusted kernel sizes of\nthe Gaussian filters and thresholds for region sizes in\ndetecting the initial suspicious regions to compensate for\nthe pixel size difference between the SFM and FFDM\nimages  This stage typically identifies between 10 and 50\n\nsuspicious regions per image depending on breast tissue\ndensity and pattern distribution  The upper level of the\nscheme’s sensitivity is determined by this stage  The\nsecond stage of the scheme applies a multilayer topo-\ngraphic region growth algorithm to segment mass\nregions  In this stage  we adjusted the difference in\nregion growth thresholds for each topographic layer to\ncompensate for the increases in mass region contrast \nBased on measurements of average contrast for all\ndetected mass regions in our FFDM database and\ncompared with the results of our previously recorded\naverage contrast for all mass regions depicted in our\ndigitised SFM database  we found that the average\ncontrast of mass regions depicted on the FFDM images\nwas approximately 80% higher  Thus  we increased\nregion growth thresholds by 25% at each of the 3 layers\nto approximately compensate for the total differences\n 80% vs 3625%575%  of the contrast levels of the masses\ndepicted on the two types of images  We also adjusted all\nsize- and contrast-related classification rules implemen-\nted in the scheme to compensate for differences in pixel\nsizes and image contrast levels  This step typically\nreduces the number of suspicious mass regions to fewer\nthan five per image \nAfter computing a set of image features for each\n\nsegmented suspicious mass region  the third stage of the\nscheme applies a multifeature-based artificial neural\nnetwork  ANN  to generate a detection score indicating\nthe likelihood of the segmented region being positive  In\nthis stage  we retrained the ANN using the FFDM images\nto account for the feature value changes  The ANN used\nexactly the same 14 input features and 4 hidden neur-\nones as previously reported [19]  From CAD-segmented\nsuspicious mass regions  we randomly selected 500 true-\npositive and 500 false-positive regions to generate a\ntraining data set  The ANNwas retrained under the same\ntraining protocol as that previously implemented to train\n\nTable 1  Case distribution of the full-field digital mammogram  FFDM  image database that included 1120 cases with a total of\n6478 FFDM images  by case

the\nrobustness of our training protocol  we randomly selected\nanother testing data set with 500 true-positive and 500\nfalse-positive regions  The performance levels on the two\n\ndata sets  training and testing  were evaluated using the\nareas under the ROC curves  computed by the program\nof ROCKIT [21]  Finally  an operating threshold was\napplied to the detection scores and only the regions with\n\n a   b \n\n c   d \n\nFigure 1  An example of applying our computer-aided detection  CAD  scheme to four full-field digital mammogram  FFDM \nimages acquired from a 48-year-old female diagnosed with cancer  The left two columns show original FFDM images and the\nright two columns highlight three CAD-segmented suspicious mass regions  of which two are associated with a spiculated mass\n right breast  and one is false positive  left breast \n\nB Zheng  J H Sumkin  M L Zuley et al\n\ne156 The British Journal of Radiology  June 2012\n\n\n\ndetection scores greater than the threshold were cued as\nthe mass regions while the other regions were discarded \nFigure 1 shows an example of applying this CAD scheme\nto four FFDM images acquired from one examination of a\n48-year-old female diagnosed with cancer \n\nPerformance assessment\n\nAfter conversion  we applied our new CAD scheme to\nall 6478 FFDM images  For each detected and segmented\nsuspicious mass region  CAD generated a detection\nscore  First  all recorded CAD scores were analysed\nusing a previously developed Free-response receiver\noperating characteristic  FROC -type data analysis\nmethod [22]  Second  using an operating threshold at\nthe same level as previously implemented for testing\n[12]  we computed the actual CAD-cueing performance \nincluding sensitivity  false-positive rate per image and\nfraction of images or examinations without false-positive\ncues  Performance levels were assessed for the entire\nimage database and for each of the five case groups  as\nwell as for the current and the prior examinations  As\ncurrent CAD schemes detect a high fraction of masses\nonly in one view [23] and clinical studies have shown\nthat radiologists are more likely to discard masses cued\nby CAD only in one view as false positives [3  4]  we\nreported both case-based and region-based performance\nlevels  In the case-based analysis  a mass was counted as\ndetected if it was cued by CAD on either one or both\nviews of the same examination  In the region-based\nanalysis  each mass region was independently counted \nAs the CAD scheme is intended to be used as a second\n\nreader  the lower the correlation between CAD-cueing\nresults and radiologists’ true-positive detections  the\nhigher the probability that CAD would help to improve\nradiologists’ performances  Previous studies suggest that\nabnormalities with low contrast  small size [24] or low\nconspicuity [25] are more difficult to detect  Therefore \nwe also analysed the ability of CAD to detect subtle\nmasses by computing correlations between CAD-gener-\nated detection scores and the values of two image-based\nfeatures  namely region conspicuity [26] and integrated\ndensity that is equivalent to estimating the actual\n‘‘physical mass’’ of a region by combining the size of\nthe mass and difference in density levels  or pixel values \nbetween pixels within the detected mass region and the\naverage density of the surrounding region or back-\nground tissue [27]  High correlations suggest that CAD\ntends to detect ‘‘easy’’ masses that may also correlate\nwith detection results by radiologists  whereas low\ncorrelations suggest that CAD can detect at least a\nfraction of ‘‘difficult’’ masses that are more likely to be\nmissed by radiologists without CAD \n\nResults\n\nOur FFDM database has the following characteristics\nthat may relate to CAD performance  First  the majority\nof cases  namely 58 2%  652/1120  and 3 6%  40/1120 \nwere rated as heterogeneously dense  BI-RAD 3  and\nextremely dense  BI-RAD 4  respectively  Figure 2\nshows the distribution of breast tissue density as rated\n\nby the radiologists during the original interpretations \nSecond  the majority of detected mass margins were\nrated by radiologists as either irregular or spiculated \nAmong the 525 verified malignant masses  the boundary\nmargins of 464 masses were actually rated by radiolo-\ngists  Among these  11  2 4%  were described as smooth \n293  63 1%  as irregular  123  26 5%  as spiculated and 37\n 8 0%  as focal asymmetry  Third  for the 174 cancer\npatients who had 2 or 3 serial mammograms  Table 1 \nwe found that 59 2%  103/174  of the masses were\n‘‘visible’’ or actually depicted on prior examinations in\nthe retrospective review \nFigure 3 displays three region-based normalised per-\n\nformance curves that show the results of the ‘‘training’’ \nthe initial testing of the re-optimised ANN and the\noverall performance when applying ANN to the entire\ndata set  We note that the entire data set included all\nregions selected for training and testing plus 20 addi-\ntional true-positive and 20 727 false-positive regions \nmaking the total number of tested regions include\n1020 true-positive and 21 727 false-positive regions  The\n‘‘pooling’’ was deemed reasonable as the areas under the\nperformance curves  AUCs  were 0 879¡0 007 for the\ntraining data set  0 871¡0 007 for the testing data set and\n0 865¡0 005 for the entire data set  The maximum\ndifference among the three AUC values was only 1 59% \nThe CAD scheme initially detected 1025 malignant\n\nmass regions distributed in 507 cases  which represented\nan upper limit of 96 6%  507/525  case-based sensitivity\nand 81 0%  1025/1265  region-based sensitivity  At this\nstage  21 727 false-positive regions on 6478 images  3 35\nper image  were also identified  The upper limits of\nsensitivity for the prior examinations were 81 6%  84/\n103  and 72 1%  145/201  for the case-based and region-\nbased detections  respectively  Figure 4 shows two case-\nbased FROC-type performance curves that included all\ninitially detected suspicious mass regions depicted

examinations and\n40 8%  42/103  for the prior examinations  The overall\nregion-based sensitivity levels were 58 1%  618/1064  for\nthe current examinations and 28 4%  57/201  for the\nprior examinations  In current examinations  the CAD\nscheme cued 55 7%  221/397  of masses on both views \nwhile only 35 7%  15/42  of masses depicted on the prior\nexaminations were cued by the CAD scheme on both\nviews  Although the CAD scheme had slightly higher\nsensitivity in cancer cases  Group 1  than in interval\ncancer cases  Group 2  in the current examinations\n 75 9% vs 72 9%  the CAD scheme had substantially\nlower sensitivity levels in Group 1 than in Group 2 in the\n\nprior examinations  35 0% vs 60 9%  which is probably\nthe result of shorter time intervals between sequential\nexaminations in the interval cancer group  approxi-\nmately 6 months on average rather than 12 months or\nlonger  This makes the use of CAD potentially more\nbeneficial in the interval cancer group \nThe CAD-generated false-positive rate in the entire\n\ndata set was 0 32  2070/6478  per image  ranging from\n0 29 to 0 51 marks per image in the 5 different case\ngroups  Table 4  These false-positive cues were distrib-\nuted on 26 1%  1692/6478  of the images or 58 1%  960/\n1651  of the examinations  resulting in a 73 9% image-\nbased specificity and a 41 9% examination-based speci-\nficity  In general  the more difficult negative case groups\n i e  high-risk pre-cancer cases with surgery excision and\nrecalled but negative cases  had higher false-positive\ncueing rates than the easy negative case group  i e  not\nrecalled screening negative cases \nTwo computed Pearson’s correlation coefficients\n\nbetween the CAD-generated scores and the two image\nfeatures for all initially detected 1025 mass regions were\n0 558  p 0 0001  for region conspicuity and 0 307\n p 0 0001  for integrated density  Figures 5 and 6 show\nhistograms of all detected mass regions as related to\nthese two image features  before and after applying the\noperating threshold to the CAD-generated detection\nscores  The large diversity of the mass regions depicted\nin this database is noted  as well as the diversity of the\nmass regions actually marked as positive by the CAD\nscheme  Namely  CAD was able to detect  cue  a fraction\nof the difficult mass regions exhibiting low conspicuity\nand/or small integrated density \n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough previous studies have investigated the\nfeasibility of converting the CAD schemes developed\nfor SFM images to new schemes for FFDM images [16 \n17] and assessed CAD performance using limited FFDM\ndatabases [13–15]  this study is a more comprehensive\nassessment study that included a number of unique\ncharacteristics  First  we used a larger and more diverse\nFFDM database that included sequential FFDM exam-\ninations acquired from 1120 females  To the best of our\nknowledge  no such large-scale CAD assessment study\nusing an FFDM database has been previously reported \nThe use of a large and diverse database increases the\nreliability in assessing CAD performance  Second  unlike\nprevious studies that reported CAD performance levels\non one testing  general  database  we compared and\nreported CAD performance levels on different categories\n subdatabases  of cases  including the current and prior\nexaminations  The results of our study indicate the large\ndifference of the CAD performance levels in different\ncase categories  Third  since CAD is used as a second\nreader  reducing the correlation between radiologists\nand CAD schemes in detecting breast cancer  i e \nmalignant masses  is important in clinical practice  We\nalso preliminarily assessed the correlations between the\nCAD-cued results and the two image features that are\nconsidered to be correlated with the difficulty of visual\ndetection \n\nFigure 3  Three region-based normalised performance\ncurves for the

2012\n\n\n\nAfter demonstrating that direct application of an SFM\nimage-based CAD scheme to the FFDM images resulted\nin the substantial degradation of performance  we used\nthe same scheme structure  approach  to re-optimise the\nCAD scheme by changing only a limited number of\nvariables/parameters  In our previous assessment study \nusing a subset of an SFM database that included a group\nof cancer cases with only current examinations  two\ncommercial CAD schemes and our own CAD scheme\nachieved 72 4%  70 7% and 67 2% case-based detection\nsensitivities at the corresponding 0 39  0 27 and 0 27\nfalse-positive detections per image  respectively [12]  In\n\nthis study  the ‘‘converted’’ CAD scheme achieved a\n75 6% case-based sensitivity at 0 32 false-positive detec-\ntions per image for a comparable case group  albeit with\na different data set by necessity  The result suggests that\nthis simple approach can yield a CAD performance level\nthat is as good as  or better than  a CAD performance\nlevel for SFM images [12]  This is largely due to better\ncontrast resolution  detection quantum efficiency and\nsystem linearity \nSimilar to the previously reported study in assessing\n\nperformances of CAD schemes for SFM images [28]  our\n\nTable 4  Computer-aided detection-cued false-positive rates in different groups of full-field digital mammogram cases

regions  namely 40 8%  42/103  of\nmasses associated with cancer that were deemed ‘‘retro-\nspectively visible’’ on prior examinations but that were\neither missed or interpreted as negative during the\noriginal clinical study were detected  In this study  44 3%\n 176/397  of masses depicted on the current FFDM\nimages were cued by CAD only on 1 view  As expected \nowing to the increase in subtleness of masses depicted on\nthe prior examinations  a larger fraction of these  64 3% \nwere cued by CAD only on 1 view  These results are\nconsistent with our previous observations using SFM\nimages [12  23]  The false-positive rate was higher in the\nhigh risk with surgery excision but benign group  0 51 \nand the recalled  with biopsy  but negative group  0 41 \nthan the group of screening negative without recall\n 0 29  Although the previous study reported that CAD\ntypically cued more false positives on the images\ndepicting denser breast tissue [29]  the increase of false-\npositive cues in the suspicious negative case groups in\nthis study is not related to the difference in breast\ndensity because the breast density BI-RADS rating\ndistributions are relatively similar across all case groups\n Figure 2  The results seem to suggest that current\nCAD-cueing results on the false positives are correlated\nwith the ‘‘ease’’ level of interpretation as performed by\nradiologists \nFalse-positive detection per image is the most popular\n\nindex to report CAD performance  i e  used for plotting\nFROC curves  in previous studies  However  since the\nCAD-cued false-positive cues are not uniformly distrib-\nuted in the images of a database  some images can depict\nmultiple false-positive cues  The fraction of images or\nexaminations  cases  without CAD-cued false positives\nshould be a more useful index in the screening environ-\nment  In this study  the false-positive rate of the CAD\nscheme was 0 32 per image  while the fractions of images\nand examinations depicting false-positive marks were\n0 261 and 0 581  respectively  Hence  the image-based\nspecificity was 73 9% and the examination-based specifi-\ncity was 41 9%  As radiologists typically read four images\nper examination  the examination-based specificity\nshould be a clinically relevant index of CAD performance \nAs a result  in order to detect 75 6% of the cancers  58 1%\nexaminations depicted at least 1 CAD-cued false-positive\nmass mark in our database  Thus  to increase radiologists’\nconfidence in CAD results for mass detection  additional\nreduction in the false-positive cueing rates remains an\nimportant and highly warranted objective \nAlthough detection sensitivity of current CAD\n\nschemes may remain relatively low  i e   80%  CAD\ncan be a valuable tool to be used as a second reader if\nthere is a lower correlation between the radiologists’\ninterpretations and the CAD cueing results  We recog-\nnised that assessing such a correlation was a very\ndifficult task that had not been fully investigated in\nCAD assessment studies  In this study  we did a few\npreliminary and simple data analyses  By assuming that\nradiologists are more likely to miss the masses with\nlower conspicuity  or smaller integrated density values\n[24–27]  we analysed and computed the correlation\nbetween CAD-generated detection scores and these two\nimage features  The results  Figures 5 and 6  suggested\nthat CAD was able to cue  or flag  some of the difficult\n\nmasses with low conspicuity and small integrated\ndensity values  The results also support that CAD can\nbe a useful tool to help radiologists detect more subtle\ncancers  in particular to further reduce its false-positive\ndetection rate \nThe study also has a number of limitations  First  our\n\ndatabase included all available sequentially ascertained\nscreening-detected cancer cases during the period of\ninterest  However  the non-all-inclusive selection of\nnegative cases may not be optimal for this purpose  as\nwe selected only 595 negative cases from a very large\npool of negative cases  Based on the limited assessments \nthe negative data set in this study seemed to represent \non average  relatively dense breasts  Second  in convert-\ning the CAD to be applicable to FFDM images  we\nindeed needed to retrain the scheme and  in particular \nthe ANN  This could affect somewhat the robustness and\ngeneralisability of our results  however  the very com-\nparable performance levels achieved on the training \nthe testing and the entire data set suggested that the\nrandomisation and training protocol we implemented  at\nleast partially  reduced biases  Third  we tested the CAD\nperformance in detecting masses and we cannot com-\nment on the feasibility of a similar conversion process in\nthe detection of microcalcification clusters  However \nmost CAD schemes achieve very high sensitivity of\ndetecting microcalcification clusters  e g   98% [26] \nwhen applied to digitised SFM images  hence  we do\nnot believe that this is a major concern primarily because\nof the improved contrast sensitivity associated with the\nFFDM images  e g  100% [15]

vaccine  HER-2/neu\n\nIntroduction\nThe immune system has traditionally been divided into two parts  the innate and the\nadaptive  The innate immune system’s components include monocytes  macrophages \ngranulocytes  NK and dendritic cells  DC  The adaptive immune system is composed of\nantibody-producing B lymphocytes  as well as CD4pos helper T cells and CD8pos cytotoxic\nT cells  These cells work together to sense  control and eliminate infection  Agents of innate\nimmunity identify microbes through special pattern recognition receptors that sense\nbiochemical structures  usually non-proteins  common to broad classes of potential\npathogens  1  On the other hand  T and B lymphocytes specialize in responding against\nantigens  usually proteins  specific to the individual species of microbe  DCs have a unique\nrole in that they form a critical bridge between innate and adaptive immunity  Pattern\nrecognition proteins belonging to the Toll-like family of transmembrane receptors  2  induce\na maturation and migration program whereby various DC populations  including monocyte-\nderived DCs  convey peripherally-acquired proteins to T cells located in the regional\ndraining lymph nodes  3  The DCs “present” the microbial antigens to T cells in the form of\nprocessed peptides complexed with self major histocompatibility proteins  4  This supplies\nan important signal  signal 1  to T cells that  along with maturation-enhanced co-stimulatory\nmolecule  CD80  CD86  expression  signal 2  can fully activate T cells  5  DCs and some\nother accessory cells can supply so-called “third signals”  6  that often are expressed in the\nform of soluble factors  for example  IL-12  IL-23  IL-6 and TGF-beta  Such signals can\nprofoundly influence helper T cell development toward discrete functional phenotypes that\ninclude IFN-γ-secreting Th1  IL-17- secreting Th17  as well as anti-inflammatory Treg that\nproduce TGF-beta and IL-10  7–10  In many instances  the precise combination of\nactivation signals received by DC dictates whether individual 3rd signal agents will be\nproduced  and hence which Th phenotypes will be selectively induced by the DC  11 \n\nAlthough the immune system evolved primarily to deal with infections  it may be possible to\ndirect it against malignancies  An ideal strategy for inducing anti-tumor immunity must\nsuccessfully accomplish several goals-some of which are overlapping with traditional anti-\nmicrobial vaccines  but others unique to the particular requirements of effective anti-tumor\nimmunity  For example  an effective anti-tumor vaccine must overcome the immune\nsystem’s natural tendency to resist the development of strong immunity against self-proteins\n i e  tolerance  It must also generate immunity of a quality and intensity likely to reduce or\neliminate tumor burdens  In the case of therapeutic vaccines  immunity must be effectively\ninduced when disease is already firmly established  Finally  such induced immunity should\nbe durable  so that possible tumor recurrences can be suppressed for long periods post-\nimmunization \n\nWe formulated a novel  integrated DC-based immunization system designed to overcome\nsome of the known obstacles facing anti-cancer vaccines  We call this strategy ICAIT\n Immune Conditioning via Activated Innate  autologous  Transfer  Here  CD14pos\nperipheral blood monocytes  which represent a precursor pool for activated DC  were\nrapidly activated into fully-functional DC in vitro with IFN-γ and a special clinical-grade\nbacterial endotoxin  LPS  LPS signals through the Toll-like pattern recognition receptor\nTLR4  12  mimicking infection and inducing a mature phenotype coincident with the\nproduction of a unique battery of secreted products  not seen with most commonly-\nemployed DC activation regimens  including high levels of the Th1-polarizing third-signal\n\nKoski et al  Page 2\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript

tumor peptide antigens based on the\nHER-2/neu sequence  representing HLA-A2  13–14  and promiscuous HLA-Class II-\nrestricted epitopes  15  so that both Th and CTL could potentially be activated  The ICAIT\nDCs were then administered directly to the lymph nodes of subjects with early HER-2/\nneupos breast cancer  ductal carcinoma in situ  Recall responses to HER-2 peptides were\nmonitored for up to 52 months post immunization  We report high rates of sensitization and\ndurable immune responses with the ICAIT immunization approach \n\nMETHODS\nClinical trial design\n\nWe conducted a pilot trial of a HER-2/neu-based DC immunization strategy for patients\nwith HER-2/neu over-expressing DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion  The primary objectives\nwere to evaluate the feasibility  safety and immunogenecity  i e  CD4pos and CD8pos T cells\nsensitized to HER-2/neu  of the immunization regimen  ICAIT DC were administered\nintranodally once per week for 4 weeks followed by definitive surgical resection of\nremaining tumor  A maximum of 30 patients were to be enrolled in order to establish safety\nand have adequate power to evaluate pre- versus post-ICAIT T cell sensitization status by\nMcNemar’s test  If no occurrence of unacceptable toxicity was observed in the 30 patients \nthen the rate of unacceptable toxicity was no higher than 7% based on the upper-bound of\nthe one-sided exact 90% confidence interval \n\nFeasibility  defined as the rate of patients who received all 4 immunizations on schedule \nwas 100%  Toxicities were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Grading Scale Version\n3 0  Sensitization of CD4pos and CD8pos T cells was assessed in pre- and post-ICAIT\nperipheral blood samples and in sentinel lymph nodes where available  Eligible patients\nwere greater than 18 years old  signed Informed Consent  had ECOG performance status 0\nor 1  and presented with biopsy-proven DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion but had not yet\nreceived definitive treatment  Patients whose DCIS was eliminated by excisional biopsy at\ndiagnosis were not eligible  HER-2/neu positivity was determined as >10% cells expressing\n2+ or 3+ intensity of the HER-2/neu protein  Patients with areas suspicious of invasive\ndisease were evaluated by MRI  All subjects underwent cardiac evaluation with MUGA scan\nor echocardiography to document adequate baseline cardiac function

subjects that received ICAIT DC pulsed with additional HLA-A2\nbinding peptides  369–377 and 689–697   13–14  each potentially capable of sensitizing\nCD8pos T cells  The capacity of each HLA-A2 1pos ICAIT-immunized subject’s CD8pos T\ncells to produce IFN-γ in response to T2 target cells pulsed either with HER-2 peptide  or\nirrelevant control peptide is displayed in Figure 3  with a summary of numbers of responders\nalso provided  Figure 3 inset  Eleven of 13  84 6%  95% exact CI 64 – 99 8%  subjects\nwith sufficient available blood CD8pos T cells to test demonstrated evidence of peptide\nreactivity to 369–377  and seven of 13  54%  also developed reactivity to 689–697  It should\nbe noted that there was only a single subject that demonstrated reactivity to one of the class I\npeptides  369–377  prior to ICAIT immunization  Interestingly  these subjects’ CD8pos T\ncells also showed  after ICAIT treatment  a tendency to directly recognized HLA-A2pos\nbreast and ovarian cancer cell lines that both over-express HER-2/neu plus the appropriate\nHLA-A2 1 restriction element  Figure 4  A representative subject is shown in Figure 4  In\nfact  11/13  84 6%  subjects displayed recognition  assessed by IFN-γ secretion  of HER-2/\nneu-expressing tumor cells  but not those that were HLA A2neg or those that did not express\nHER-2/neu  Table 1  One of these subjects had evidence of tumor recognition prior to\nvaccination 080102-09  Table 1  These data confirm that ICAIT therapy resulted in CD8pos\nT cell sensitization against HER-2/neu peptides in a large proportion of immunized subjects \n\nICAIT treatment induces anti-HER-2/neu CD4pos immunity\nELISPOT assays were performed directly on unexpanded patient PBMC  There were three\nsubjects with insufficient cells to perform ELISPOT and in vitro sensitization leaving 22 for\nevaluation  These showed that 22 of 25  88%  95% exact CI 68 8 – 97 5%  subjects  CD4pos\nT cells  experienced at least two-fold increases in the ratio of HER-2/neu peptide-specific\nIFN-γ secreting cells  post-ICAIT immunization compared to pre-ICAIT  for at least one of\nthe six tested peptides  Figure 5  Nineteen of these 25  76%  95% exact CI 54 9 – 90 6% \nsubjects demonstrated such ICAIT-enhanced responses to more than one peptide  ELISA\nresults from in vitro sensitization assays confirmed the anti-HER-2/neu responses in these\npatients  data not shown  There was no evidence of IL-5 or IL-4 production by these cells\nusing ELISPOT or IVS  data not shown  The pre-post ratio of tetanus spots was always less\nthat 2  suggesting the sensitization seen of CD4pos T cells to HER-2/neu was specific to\nvaccination not just non-specific immune activation \n\nIdentification of lymphocytes trafficking to sites of DCIS and analysis of anti-HER-2/neu\nCD4pos T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes\n\nICAIT DCs were administered in distant groin nodes with the expectation that they would\nefficiently sensitize lymphocytes within these secondary lymphoid tissues  However  to be\neffective  node-sensitized lymphocytes must traffic to sites of disease  We therefore\nperformed immunohistochemical analysis comparing pre-ICAIT breast biopsies and post-\nICAIT surgical specimens to determine whether increased levels of lymphocytes could be\nobserved around sites of DCIS as an apparent consequence of ICAIT immunization  Fig\n6A  In pre-treatment biopsy specimens  it was common to observe low to moderate levels\nof lymphocytes scattered in the stromal regions outside the DCIS-containing ducts \nHowever  for about 50% of subjects assessed  we observed post-ICAIT increases in CD4pos\n Th  and CD8pos  CTL  T cells  as well as CD20pos cells  which were probably B\nlymphocytes  Not only were the lymphocytes more numerous  their distribution within the\nbreast tissues was greatly altered  with the infiltrating lymphocytes now crowding close\naround the DCIS-containing ducts  forming pronounced “collars”  In addition  we noted that\nprior to vaccination no lymphocytes could be routinely observed within the DCIS lesions \nHowever  after ICAIT treatment  CD8pos cells were detected among the tumor cells  Figure\n6B  It should be noted that the subject depicted in Figure 6 was not an HLA-A2 1pos\n\nKoski et al  Page 7\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013

peptides  but not the\n369 or 689 HLA-A2 1-binding CTL epitopes  In addition  we did not observe any changes\nconsistent with increases in CD56pos NK or DCs  not shown \n\nThese immunohistochemical studies showed post-ICAIT increases in lymphocytic\ninfiltration at areas of DCIS  but could not prove the actual antigen specificity of the\ntrafficked cells  Because assessment of T cell antigen specificity even within fresh DCIS\nspecimens is not practical  we instead recovered lymphocytes from the tumor-draining\nsentinel lymph nodes that were excised at the time of surgery to remove residual DCIS  We\nreasoned that if HER-2/neu-specific T cells were entering diseased breast tissues  some of\nthem would  as part of their natural tendency to re-circulate  transit through the draining\nlymph nodes  Unexpanded CD4pos T cells obtained from draining sentinel nodes showed\nHER-2/neu-specific responses in 21 of 22  95 5%  95% CI 77 2 – 99 9%  subjects from\nwhom such sentinel nodes were available  Fig 7  This high proportion suggests that T cells\nsensitized at remote locations  i e  anatomically distal lymph nodes  via ICAIT do routinely\ntraffic to the site of disease in the breast \n\nICAIT treatment induces long-lasting immunity\nSome patients voluntarily gave additional blood at various times ranging from 6 months\nthrough 52 months post-ICAIT immunization  Thirteen of 14 patients from whom PBL were\nobtained at least 6 months after completion of the study demonstrated reactivity to one or\nmore HER-2/neu peptides by ELISPOT assay  Figure 8  The data shown are ELISPOT\nresults obtained from PBL stimulated only once with recall peptide without any prior in\nvitro expansion  Even in follow-up beyond two years  there remained robust anti-HER-2/neu\nCD4pos reactivity for many subjects  including all three individuals who were assessed\nbeyond 48 months  The long-term responses to HER-2 were of such intensity that they were\nin the range or sometimes exceeded even the magnitude of the recall response against\ntetanus toxoid in 22 of the 25 samples tested  These results are particularly encouraging\nsince long-lasting immunity  though often difficult to achieve against tumor antigens  is\nprobably key for preventing disease recurrence \n\nDISCUSSION\nBecause the term “dendritic cell” encompasses a fairly diverse set of cell types with unique\nlineages and functions  there is presently no clear consensus which type of DC or DC\nprecursor  or which activation regimen  is best suited for use in vaccine development  A\nseminal discovery in DC research was that peripheral blood monocytes could be made to\nadopt the characteristics of immature DC if cultured for a week or more in cytokines such as\nGM-CSF and/or IL-4  24–26  with mature DC phenotypical features obtainable through\nfurther culture with inflammatory cytokine combinations or other activating agents  18  27–\n28  These findings were of great practical importance because unlike most DC populations \nCD14pos monocytes are relatively abundant in peripheral blood  about 10% of total WBC \nmaking them a highly convenient source of DC for in vitro studies and clinical use \nHowever  it remained uncertain whether the monocyte-derived cells were “authentic” DC\nrather than merely DC-like cells  Also at issue was whether monocytes represented a\nbiologically-relevant precursor pool for DCs in vivo  or if the previous observations were\nmerely an artifact of in vitro culture and activation  Part of this doubt stemmed from an\ninability to define an anatomical compartment where monocytes would be exposed to\ncytokines long periods  29 \n\nThe question as to whether monocytes can become functionally authentic DC seems now\nlargely put to rest with the report that mouse monocytes can be mobilized to develop into\nDCs in vivo in a TLR4- and Trif-dependent manner when driven by bacterial LPS or gram-\n\nKoski et al

bacteria  living or killed  This transformation is rapid  leads to monocyte-derived\nDC trafficking to T-dependent areas of draining lymph nodes  and results in acquisition of\nantigen presenting function equal or in some cases superior to “authentic” non monocyte-\nderived DCs  3  These studies not only establish monocytes as a bona fide precursor to\nauthentic DCs in vivo  but also reinforce the notion that simulating actual infection  with\nagents such as LPS  rather than aseptic inflammation  using cytokine cocktails  induces\ncells with exquisitely-developed DC function \n\nOur group has pioneered the use of mimics of infection to drive the rapid in vitro\ndifferentiation of monocytes into DCs  30–32  with the ultimate goal of using such cells as\nplatforms for immunization  To this end  we have also formulated a novel  integrated DC-\nbased immunization strategy to maximize vaccine effectiveness  This approach harvests\nCD14pos monocytes from the peripheral blood  but places them  after antigen loading and\nLPS-activated DC differentiation  directly into lymph nodes  which serve as the cradles for\nT cell-dependent immune responses  16  33  Historically  the removal of a tissue and its\nreplacement at a new location within the donor is termed an “autologous transfer”  This\nvaccine strategy also relies uniquely upon the specialized cytokine/chemokine environment\ncreated by the LPS-activated DCs in the lymph node  These soluble products have the\npotential to exert a critical influence over many aspects of T lymphocytes functional\ncapacity  discussed below  The tandem use of cytokine-secreting DCs  and their placement\ndirectly into lymph nodes rather than injecting them at peripheral sites   where they may\nneedlessly expend these factors  means that the lymph node T cells are not merely sensitized\nto antigen  but also “conditioned” by the soluble factors that drive the acquisition of\nspecialized and desirable functional characteristics  Because of these innovative features  we\nrefer to this vaccination system as ICAIT  Immune Conditioning by Activated Innate\n autologous  Transfer \n\nThere were several reasons to predict that combining IFN-γ with LPS would induce vaccine\nDCs that would serve as unusually active vehicles for generating strong  long-lasting Th1-\npolarized immunity against tumors and tumor antigens  For example  this combination\ninduces extremely high levels of many soluble products from maturing DCs not seen with\nconventional activation regimens  Fig 2  Among these factors  IL-12 in particular possesses\na number of activities well-documented in vitro and in animal models  which are highly\nsupportive of anti-tumor immunity  For example  IL-12 is known to polarize CD4pos Th\ncells into the IFN-γ-secreting Th1 phenotype  34  and IFN-γ has been shown to be a critical\nfeature in effective anti-tumor immunity  35  In addition  IL-12 contributes to avoiding\ntolerance  enhancing granzyme B production  improving cytotoxicity  and also prolongs T\ncell survival through a Bcl-3-mediated mechanism  36–38  Finally  its presence during\nCD8pos CTL sensitization has been shown in vitro to enhance functional avidity  i e  antigen\nsensitivity  making the T cells better at recognizing targets with low levels of specific\npeptide MHC complexes  39  Considering these precedents  it was therefore not\nunreasonable that DCs pulsed with HER-2/neu peptides and activated with LPS and IFN-γ\nshould be capable either of inducing de novo or enhancing anti-HER-2/neu CD4pos T cell\nresponses in well over 80% of immunized subjects  As might be expected  the cytokine\nsecretion profiles for all subjects tested demonstrated strong Th1 polarization  high IFN-γ\nwith low or absent production of other cytokines such as IL-4  IL-5 and IL-10  Also  11 of\n13 HLA-A2 1pos immunized subjects produced CTL that directly recognized tumor lines\nthat naturally over-express HER-2/neu  This finding is of particular interest because it has\nproven notoriously difficult to achieve such direct recognition of tumors  40  41  despite the\nfact that such direct recognition is probably critical for anti-tumor CTL activity in vivo  Our\nearlier in vitro studies suggested that IL-12 produced by DC at the time of CTL sensitization\nendowed the T cells with the capacity to recognize both peptide-pulsed T2 targets and\nantigen-expressing tumor cells in 85% of the healthy donors tested  owing to enhancements\n\nKoski et al  Page 9\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript

vitro sensitization studies using T cells\nand DC from healthy donors almost precisely anticipated the rates of sensitization leading to\ndirect tumor recognition observed in this in vivo  neoadjuvant immunization trial using\nsimilar IL-12-secreting DCs \n\nOne particularly interesting feature that could not be anticipated from our earlier in vitro\nwork was the tendency of ICAIT-sensitized T cells to traffic to areas of disease  Although\nprior to ICAIT treatment  lymphocytes could be seen scattered about the breast tissues  they\nwere rarely  if ever  observed within the DCIS lesions themselves  After ICAIT treatment \nhowever  the number of lymphocytes in breast tissues greatly increased for many subjects \nThese cells tended to congregated densely about the DCIS-containing ducts  with CD8pos\nCTL even crossing the epithelial border and mingling with the actual tumor cells  Moreover \nwe observed CD8pos infiltrates even in cases where the treated subjects were HLA-A2 1neg \nand therefore received neither the 369 nor the 689 peptide CTL epitopes as part of their\nimmunization  Thus the presence of CTL within these tumors after immunization suggests\neither that stimulation of Th cells is somehow recruiting endogenously-sensitized CTL  or\nthere are nested CTL epitopes within the promiscuous class II peptides that can be processed\nand cross-presented to CD8pos cells in the ICAIT-treated individual  In either case this bodes\nwell for the sensitization of critical CTL even in instances where we cannot know and\nprovide precise HLA class I-binding CTL epitopes as part of the ICAIT treatment\nadministered to HLA-A2 1neg individuals \n\nAnother feature of the ICAIT DC that warrants comment is their demonstrated “killer DC”\nfunction  especially in relation to the “gold standard” CMC-DC  It had been shown\npreviously by others that human monocyte-derived DCs are capable of adopting a somewhat\nunexpected effector function characterized by the ability to induce apoptotic death in diverse\ntumor cells  This capacity could be induced by such activating agents as type I interferons\n 42  and double-stranded RNA  43  Similar findings were also reported with bacterial LPS\nacting on pre-committed peripheral blood DC  44  with further augmentation observed in\ncombination with IFN-γ  The ICAIT DC in our study showed that this latter combination\nalso efficiently induced killer DC function in monocyte-derived DC  Although we have not\nyet determined whether the killing is mediated through TNF  TRAIL or some other\nmechanism  this observation suggests additional therapeutic approaches incorporating\nICAIT DC  For example  in addition to injecting ICAIT DC into lymph nodes for T cell\nsensitization and conditioning  they could conceivably be introduced to the site of disease\n tumors  There  the activated DCs could serve as effectors to promote direct tumor killing \nthereby releasing additional tumor antigens to further drive T cell sensitization and\nexpansion  In addition  the secreted cytokines and chemokines made by ICAIT DC could\nserve to enhance target homing of the T lymphocytes sensitized in the lymph nodes  The\nlocally-secreted products could also conceivably alter the microenvironment of the tumor\nitself to favor acute inflammation and tumor destruction \n\nIn summary  the ICAIT approach utilizing LPS and IFN-γ-activated DC resulted in high\nrates T cell sensitization to synthetic HER-2/neu class I- and class II-restricted peptides  The\nsensitizations were particularly unusual in their durability  extending up to 52 months  their\ntendency to induce T cells capable of direct tumor recognition  and the capacity of ICAIT-\nsensitized lymphocytes to traffic to and penetrate sites of disease  These results  coupled\nwith recent findings that LPS-activated mouse monocytes acquire most potent DC function\n 3  strongly suggest that LPS-activated monocyte-derived DCs should be further explored as\nplatforms for inducing enhanced anti-tumor immunity in humans \n\nKoski et al  Page 10\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

breast cancer  survival  prevention  epidemiology\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere is convincing evidence for an inverse relationship between physical activity and\nbreast cancer with many studies reporting a 20% to 30% decreased risk of developing breast\ncancer for those who are physically active  and most reporting a dose-response relationship\n[1  2]  The inverse relationship of breast cancer with physical activity has been consistently\nobserved in both cohort and case-control studies and across many subgroups including both\npre- and postmenopausal women  intensity of physical activity  and appears to be\nindependent of obesity and hormone receptor status [3  4]  Further  a recent review suggests\nthat recreational physical activity  rather than occupational  household  and transportation  is\nassociated with the greatest decreases in risks observed for physical activity on breast cancer\noccurrence [4]  Similar mechanisms for breast cancer risk and survival are thought to be\ninvolved  including direct reduction in exposure to sex steroid hormones  reduced insulin\nand insulin-like growth factors  modulation of inflammation and indirectly through reduced\nadiposity [5]  Therefore  increasing physical activity is a promising preventive measure for\nreducing risk of death after a breast cancer diagnosis \n\nWhile there is ample evidence supporting a reduction in breast cancer risk for higher levels\nof physical activity  fewer studies have examined whether exercise influences mortality\namong breast cancer survivors  Both case-control and cohort studies have investigated this\nassociation  most finding an inverse association between physical activity and survival\n[6-11]  However  only a few studies have investigated intensity of recreational physical\nactivity on breast cancer survival [9  11  12]  and to our knowledge  no studies have\nevaluated the effect of the timing of physical activity during the lifetime on survival after\nbreast cancer diagnosis \n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether the amount  intensity  duration and timing\nof prediagnostic physical activity influences risk of death after a breast cancer diagnosis in\nthe Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project  population-based cohort of women with breast\ncancer \n\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\n\nThis study draws on data that were collected from participants as part of the Long Island\nBreast Cancer Study Project  LIBCSP  a population-based study of English-speaking\nresidents of Nassau and Suffolk counties of Long Island  New York [13]  LIBCSP\nparticipants were women newly diagnosed with a first  primary in situ  or invasive breast\ncancer between August 1  1996  and July 31  1997  Women were identified using a rapid\nreporting system established specifically for the LIBCSP and were confirmed by physician’s\nand medical records  The attending physician was contacted to confirm study eligibility and\nto seek permission to contact the patient  Institutional review board approval of the study\nprotocol was obtained from each collaborating institution and participating hospital and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from each participant before the interview  A total of\n1 508 women with breast cancer  of which 1 273 had invasive breast cancer  participated in\nthe LIBCSP baseline  case-control study interview  which was administered shortly after\n\nCleveland et al  Page 2\n\nEur J Cancer Prev  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

Index  NDI \n\nData Collection\nBaseline Data—The lifetime physical activity and most of the covariate data used in this\nanalysis were collected as part of the LIBCSP baseline interview  The main questionnaire\nwas administered in-home by a trained interviewer and took ~2 hours to complete \nInformation obtained from the main questionnaire includes reproductive and menstrual\nhistory  exogenous hormone use  family history of cancer  body size  physical activity \nsmoking history  alcohol intake  and demographic characteristics  Nearly two thirds of\nbaseline case interviews occurred before initiation of chemotherapy [13]  Descriptive\ncharacteristics for the entire LIBCSP study have been previously published [13] \n\nAs part of the baseline interview  participants reported participation in recreational physical\nactivity  RPA  using an instrument which was a modification of that developed by Bernstein\nand colleagues [14  15]  Participants were asked about all recreational physical activities in\nwhich they had engaged for at least one hour per week for at least three months or more in\nany year over their entire lifetime  but prior to the breast cancer diagnosis  Activity\ninformation recorded was the name of the activity  the ages the activity was started and\nstopped  the total years of participation in the activity  the number of months per year and\nthe number of hours per week the activity was usually performed \n\nTreatment and Tumor Characteristic Data—Information on treatment undergone for\nthe first primary breast cancer is based on response at baseline and during follow-up  Nearly\ntwo-thirds of participants with breast cancer completed their baseline interview prior to the\ninitiation of chemotherapy  therefore additional treatment information was obtained by\ntrained interviewer via telephone from 1 098 case participants or their proxy in 2002 to 2004\nand by re-abstracting medical records  There were 410 cases without follow-up interview\ndata due to non-response  refusal  untraceability  or death without an identifiable proxy \n\nData on estrogen receptor  ER  and progesterone receptor  PR  status were gathered from\nmedical records of 1 402 women who signed a medical release form  Treatment and tumor\ncharacteristic data were abstracted for 598 women  A high concordance was found between\ninformation abstracted from records and self-reported radiation therapy  κ = 0 97 \nchemotherapy  κ = 0 96  and hormone therapy  κ = 0 92  Thus  for this study  the analysis\nis based on self-reported treatment at the baseline and follow-up interviews \n\nStudy Outcome—For the LIBCSP follow-up study  the NDI was used to ascertain all-\ncause and breast cancer-specific mortality among study participants  Because most women\nwho die from their breast cancer will do so within five years of diagnosis [16]  we are\nreporting survival after 5 years of follow-up  Participants were followed from diagnosis until\nDecember 31  2002  Among the 1 508 women diagnosed with breast cancer  198  13 1% \ndeaths occurred  Based on International Classification of Diseases  ICD  codes 174 9 and\nC-50 9 listed as a primary or secondary code on the death certificate  128  64 6%  deaths\nwere due to breast cancer  Cases without a death record in the NDI database were\ndetermined to be alive as of December 31  2002 \n\nVariable Definitions\nRecreational Physical Activity—Among participants classified as ever having\nparticipated in recreational physical activity  a duration-frequency measure was calculated\nusing the reported number of hours per week of participation summed across all activities\nfor each year of a woman’s life  This combination duration and frequency measure was\n\nCleveland et al  Page 3\n\nEur J Cancer Prev  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\ncalculated as hours per week of activity and examined among all women  This variable was\nthen further divided among subcategories of specific time periods during the lifecourse\nincluding RPA over the lifetime  expressed as hours per week of RPA from menarche to\ndiagnosis  premenopausal RPA  for postmenopausal women only  RPA from menarche up\nto menopause  RPA from onset of menopause to diagnosis  and recent RPA  within 10\nyears prior to diagnosis  There were 1 504 case women who had a valid response for\nphysical activity \n\nMetabolic equivalent task  MET  scores were assigned to each reported activity using a\npublished database as a guide [17]  One MET is defined as the energy expended when\nsitting quietly  which is equal to 3 5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per\nminute  or one kilocalorie per kilogram of body weight per hour [17]  This MET score was\nthen multiplied by the number of hours per week the subject reported engaging in the\nactivity to derive MET-hours per week  MET-h/wk  that were averaged for annual activity\nlevels  MET-h/wk  for the specific lifecourse time periods described above  Use of this\nmeasure in analyses allowed for simultaneous examination of activity duration  and\nfrequency in relation to risk of breast cancer  Total RPA was further classified according to\nintensity  where low intensity activities were defined as those expending  6 months before\nthe date of diagnosis or if both ovaries were removed before the date of diagnosis  Women\nwith unknown menopausal status were categorized as postmenopausal based on the 90th\npercentile for age at menopause in the control population from the baseline study  and\ncalculated according to smoking status  ≥54 8 yrs for smokers and ≥55 4 yrs for non-\nsmokers \n\nStatistical Methods\nLifetime RPA was defined as RPA from menarche to diagnosis  RPA analyses were also\ncarried out for the life periods from menarche to menopause  menopause to diagnosis  and\nrecent RPA  within 10 years prior to diagnosis  To reduce the possibility that RPA by life\nperiod associations we observed were due to the differences in sample size  the analyses for\ntiming of RPA was restricted to women who had a reported RPA measure at each time\npoint  Physical activity variables were classified as MET-h/wk in categories defined as 0  >0\nto 8 9  and 9 or more MET-h/wk  These cutpoints were selected based on Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine\nrecommendations for physical activity [18] as well as for consistency with other\n\nCleveland et al  Page 4\n\nEur J Cancer Prev  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

used to generate survival curves by RPA category  data\nnot shown  Cox proportional hazards regression [20] was used to estimate hazard ratios\n HR  and 95% confidence intervals  95% CI  for the risk of all-cause and breast cancer-\nspecific mortality  Participants with in situ disease were excluded when calculating breast\ncancer-specific mortality estimates  Proportional hazards assumptions were verified with\nSchoenfield residuals  No violation of this assumption was found  The results for overall and\n5-year survival were similar  therefore  only overall survival is reported  Tests of trend were\nconducted using the continuous values for RPA \n\nEffect measure modification on the multiplicative scale between categorical RPA variables\nand other covariates was evaluated using the log likelihood ratio test to compare\nproportional hazards regression models with and without the cross-product terms [20]  To\nassess for potential heterogeneity  we evaluated effects stratified by variables  which\nincluded exogenous hormone use  never used hormones  ever used hormones  body mass\nindex  median BMI = weight in meters/height in meters squared  menopausal status\n premenopausal  postmenopausal  and family history of breast cancer in a first-degree\nrelative  no family history  family history  Associations were also evaluated by\nstratification on the tumor characteristics ER

substantially alter the estimates of\neffect therefore all models include only age at diagnosis and BMI in the year prior to the\ndiagnosis  Models including both pre- and postmenopausal women were also adjusted for\nmenopausal status \n\nTo further explore possible confounding by tumor characteristics and treatment  we\nconducted separate analyses restricted to women for whom we have complete tumor\ncharacteristic and tumor treatment data  There were no differences in effects or evidence of\nconfounding by these variables for the relationship between RPA and mortality  All analyses\nwere carried out using SAS version 9 1 [22] \n\nRESULTS\nThere were 196 deaths identified  128 due to breast cancer  Mean follow up was 66 7\nmonths  range  2 7-88 6  Distributions of select characteristics by total MET-h/wk of RPA\nfrom menarche up to diagnosis among women with breast cancer are shown in Table 1 \nWomen who engaged RPA during this time tended to be younger at diagnosis  more likely\nto have completed high school  had a lower BMI and were more likely to have taken\nexogenous hormones than those who were inactive  There was little difference in estrogen\nreceptor or progesterone receptor status in physically active women compared with inactive\nwomen \n\nResults for analyses that examined the association between overall lifetime physical activity\nand intensity

63  95% CI=0 43-0 91  No\nsignificant trends were observed for reduced mortality with increasing MET h/wk of RPA\n data not shown \n\nWe also investigated the effect of intensity of RPA on death outcomes  Moderate intensity\nlifetime RPA also resulted in decreased mortality  where those who reported ever regularly\nengaging in moderate RPA had lower risk of death attributed to breast cancer

who engaged in vigorous intensity physical activity \n\nThe 5-year survival for premenopausal women who engaged in any lifetime RPA was 93%\nand 85% for inactive women  Figure 1a  Similarly  among postmenopausal breast cancer\nparticipants the 5-year survival from any cause was 90% for active women and 83% for\ninactive women  Figure 1b  Associations were similar  although slightly attenuated  for\nbreast cancer-specific mortality  We further evaluated the association of lifetime RPA\nstratified by menopausal status and found no evidence of statistically significant interaction\n P for

RPA  HR =0 53  95% CI=0 28-0 97  HR =0 54  95%\nCI=0 27-1 05  respectively  although there were no apparent trends for reduced risk of\ndeath with increasing RPA  Table 3  Similar  although attenuated  reduced associations that\napproached statistical significance were seen for low levels of RPA up to 8 9 MET-h/wk and\nhigh levels greater than 9 0 MET-h/wk among postmenopausal women \n\nWhen considering the timing of physical activity among postmenopausal women  we\nobserved that engaging in exercise after menopause was associated with a reduced risk of\ndeath due to all causes  whereas there was no effect for physical activity which took place\nbefore menopause  Table 4  Compared with inactive women  those who engaged in 9 MET-\nh/wk or more of RPA after menopause had a 67% lower risk of death  HR=0 33  95%\nCI=0 17-0 63  P for trend = 0 002  Results for breast cancer-specific mortality were similar \nbut not as strong as those seen for deaths from all causes  Postmenopausal women who\nengaged in physical activity in the 10 years prior to diagnosis showed similar results for all-\ncause mortality as those seen for RPA after menopause  ≥9 MET-h/wk vs  no RPA  HR =\n0 33  95% CI=0 18-0 61 \n\nAnalyses of overall and breast cancer mortality stratified by BMI is shown in Table 5  We\nobserved no decreasing trend in overall or breast cancer-specific mortality observed for\nthose with increasing levels of RPA in either normal weight or overweight/obese women \nSimilar associations for breast cancer-specific mortality were seen for women who were\nnormal weight and

from clinical trials with design features that limit external validity  The ability to\naccurately identify cardiotoxicity from administrative data would enhance safety information \n\nObjective—To characterize the performance of claims-based algorithms for identification of\ncardiac dysfunction in a cancer population \n\nResearch Design—We sampled 400 charts among 6 460 women diagnosed with incident breast\ncancer  tumor size ≥2 cm or node positivity  treated within 8 US health care systems during 1999–\n2007  We abstracted medical records for clinical diagnoses of heart failure  HF  and\ncardiomyopathy  CM  or evidence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction  We then assessed\nthe performance of 3 different ICD-9-based algorithms \n\nResults—The HF/CM coding algorithm designed a priori to balance performance characteristics\nprovided a sensitivity of 62%  95% confidence interval 40–80%  specificity of 99%  97–99% \npositive predictive value  PPV  of 69%  45–85%  and negative predictive value  NPV  of 98%\n 96–99%  When applied only to incident HF/CM  ICD-9 codes and gold standard diagnosis both\nappearing after breast cancer diagnosis  in patients exposed to anthracycline and/or trastuzumab\ntherapy the PPV was 42%  14–76% \nConclusions—Claims-based algorithms have moderate sensitivity and high specificity for\nidentifying HF/CM among patients with invasive breast cancer  Because the prevalence of HF/CM\namong the breast cancer population is low  ICD-9 codes have high NPV but only moderate PPV \nThese findings suggest a significant degree of misclassification due to HF/CM overcoding versus\nincomplete clinical documentation of HF/CM in the medical record \n\nKeywords\nbreast neoplasms  drug therapy  complications  cardiomyopathies  clinical coding\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCardiotoxicity is a known complication of certain systemic chemotherapies 1 Specifically \nthe development of cardiomyopathy  CM  with associated left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction  LVSD  and symptomatic heart failure  HF  are well documented adverse\neffects of anthracycline-based therapies and trastuzumab adjuvant therapy used to treat\nbreast cancer 2–4 However  estimates of risk have been derived from randomized controlled\ntrials  RCTs  with design features that may limit their external validity  Existing RCTs\nlargely excluded older patients and those with comorbidities  especially pre-existing\ncardiovascular conditions that may potentially be associated with higher rates of drug\ntoxicity  For example  of the 3 major trials of trastuzumab published in 2005 and 2006 that\nled to its widespread use  only 16% of women enrolled were 60 years or older5–7 compared\n\nAllen et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015

approximately\n40% of the HER2-positive population 8 Additionally  all 3 of these trastuzumab trials\nexcluded women with a history of HF  CM  coronary artery disease  uncontrolled\nhypertension  valvular disease  or unstable arrhythmias  More recent RCTs comparing the\nsafety and efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens in HER-2 positive breast cancer have\ncontinued to enroll a majority of patients  65 years of age  54% received\nanthracyclines and/or trastuzumab  and 28% of patients received no chemotherapy \nCompared to the chart-review eligible cohort  the 400 patients selected for detailed chart\nabstraction were older  had more comorbidity  had greater minority representation  had\nhigher stage of breast cancer  and were more likely to receive chemotherapy than the\noriginal population  see Table 1 \n\nDistribution of ICD-9 Codes for HF/CM Among Women with Breast Cancer\nA primary hospital discharge diagnosis of HF/CM was found in 1 5% of the total cohort  and\n10 8% of the oversampled chart abstraction cohort  Table 2  Outpatient ICD-9 codes for\nHF/CM occurred on ≥2 occasions in an additional 2 8% of the total cohort  and 18 0% of the\noversampled chart abstraction cohort  Other combinations of ICD-9 codes constituting HF/\nCM in algorithm #2 were rare  Any ICD-9 code was found in 41 5% of the chart sample \n\nThere was a more than 3-fold variation between sites in the frequency of ICD-9 codes for\nHF/CM among their breast cancer populations  data not shown  Among possible ICD-9\ncodes for HF/CM assigned to patients  the general code 428 0 “congestive heart failure \nunspecified” was the most frequently used at each of the 8 sites  Codes that specified the\nacuity and type of heart failure  e g  428 21 “acute systolic heart failure”  were used 10-fold\nless frequently than the general 428 0 designation  Codes for cardiomyopathy  425 4 and\n425 9  accounted for 2 9–9 0% of HF/CM ICD-9 codes at individual sites  Hypertensive\nheart disease with HF  402 and 404  codes accounted for less than 1% of HF/CM ICD-9\ncodes \n\nClinical and Imaging-Based Diagnosis of HF/CM Manually Abstracted from Charts\nDescription of HF/CM in the health record—Any mention of HF/CM  Appendix  was\nfound in 122 of the 400 abstracted patients  30 5%  with a median of 3 5 unique episodes of\ncare describing HF/CM per positively identified patient  On subsequent review by the study\ncardiologist  92 were determined to be “definite” HF/CM  6 “not” HF/CM  and 24\n“indeterminate” due to inadequate documentation to apply strict HF/CM criteria  grouped as\n“not” for the primary analysis \n\nCardiac imaging studies—Cardiac imaging studies with estimation of LVEF were\nfound among 259 women  64 8%  with 73 patients having only 1 study  51 patients with 2\nstudies  36 having 3 studies  and 99 having 4–13 studies  Echocardiographic modalities were\nmost common  Of the 400 sampled patients  52  13 0%  were found to have an LVEF\nrecorded quantitatively at <50% or qualitatively as mildly  moderately  or severely reduced \n14 of 52 women  26 9%  had documentation of reduced LVEF without a clinical diagnosis\nof HF/CM in the chart \n\nPerformance of Three ICD-9 Algorithms in the Breast Cancer Population\nThe sensitivity  specificity  PPV  and NPV are provided for the 3 different ICD-9-based\nclaims-based algorithms in Table 3  When assessed against the combined gold standard of\nchart abstracted clinical diagnosis and/or reduced LVEF  the balanced algorithm  #2  had a\nsensitivity of 62%  95% confidence interval [CI] of 40–80%  specificity of 99%  97–99% \nPPV of 69%  45–85%  and NPV of 98%  96–99%  Compared to the other algorithms  the\nbalanced #2 algorithm maximized sensitivity and PPV with relatively similar specificity and\n\nAllen et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 May 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

In secondary analyses  when we included patients with an “indeterminate” chart\nabstracted clinical diagnosis of HF/CM as disease true positive  the performance of\nalgorithm #2 changed mildly  sensitivity 59%  40–76%  specificity 99%  97–100%  PPV\n82%  58–94%  and NPV 97%  95–99% \n\nAlgorithm Performance by Prevalent v  Incident and Exposed v  Unexposed\nThe sensitivity  specificity  PPV  and NPV for balanced algorithm #2 in relationship to\nprevalent and incident HF/CM are provided in Table 4  Mandating timing concordance\nbetween the appearances of claims-based and chart-abstracted HF/CM  i e  both having first\nappearance before the date of breast cancer diagnosis [prevalent]  or both having first\nappearance after the date of breast cancer diagnosis [incident]  had the expected effect of\nreduced sensitivity and PPV  though confidence intervals were wide due to decreased\nsample size  Specifically  of the 61 prevalent cases identified from medical record\nabstraction  12 were classified as incident cases via the administrative claims algorithm \n\nBased on existing knowledge of the relationship of chemotherapy with cardiotoxicity  the\nICD-9 algorithm performance characteristics of greatest research interest involve\nidentification of incident HF/CM among patients exposed to anthracyclines and/or\ntrastuzumab compared to the background rate of incident HF/CM  Algorithm performance\nfor identification of incident HF/CM among exposed patients trended towards a higher PPV\n Table 5  although due to smaller numbers of patients  the confidence intervals for\nperformance characteristics are wide \n\nSecondary analysis showed that among the 29 exposed patients identified by the\nadministrative claims algorithm as having incident HF/CM  Table 5  5 patients had their\nICD-9 code appear between cancer diagnosis and initiation of anthracycline / trastuzumab\ntherapy  among the 27 unexposed patients identified by the algorithm as having incident HF/\nCM  11 patients had their ICD-9 code appear within 70 days following cancer diagnosis \nSimilarly  among the 32 exposed patients identified by chart review as having incident HF/\nCM  1 patient had diagnostic information appear between cancer diagnosis and initiation of\nanthracycline / trastuzumab therapy  among the 14 unexposed patients identified by chart\nabstraction as having incident HF/CM  9 patients had their diagnostic information appear\nwithin 70 days following cancer diagnosis  Because of the even smaller number of incident\ncases identified under this delayed definition  algorithm performance characteristics for\nincident disease become unstable  95% CI for PPV 0–96 6% \n\nDISCUSSION\nAn algorithm of claims-based ICD-9 codes has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for\nHF/CM among women with incident invasive breast cancer  We found that the performance\nof an existing claims-based HF algorithm  modified here to include CM  ICD-9 codes 425 4\nand 425 9  was lower in this unique population of breast cancer patients  overall PPV 69%\n[Table 3]  incident-exposed PPV 42% [Table 5]  as compared to prior validation in a general\npopulation of adult patients  PPV 97% 11–13 These findings suggest a significant degree of\nmisclassification for this automated HF/CM algorithm among women with invasive breast\ncancer  which reflects HF/CM overcoding  algorithm false positives  versus incomplete\nclinical documentation of HF/CM in the medical record  true disease missed by gold\nstandard assessment \n\nBecause the

an approach  If overcoding is more common among patients\nafter treatment with potentially cardiotoxic agents  significant overattribution from these\nobservational associations is likely  However  because increased screening for cardiac\ndisease is also likely to occur immediately after cancer diagnosis before initiation of\nchemotherapy  documentation of cardiac disease will then justify the avoidance of\npotentially cardiotoxic agents in such patients  Therefore  detection biases are likely to have\ncomplex implications for estimates of cardiotoxicity  Secondary analyses do suggest that\nnew documentation and coding for HF/CM are particularly likely to occur soon after breast\ncancer diagnoses in patients who ultimately do not go on to receive antracycline and/or\ntrastuzumab therapy  Unfortunately  because of limited power in subgroup analyses it is\nimpossible to provide precise estimates of the effect of these various biases \n\nAnthracycline and trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity is generally felt to manifest as\ncardiomyopathy documented as a decrease in the LVEF  Therefore  the cases of greatest\ninterest among the broader cohort would be HF with new reductions in LVEF following\nexposure to these chemotherapies  Because of 1  the absence of serial cardiac imaging\nstudies for the majority of patients  2  the inability to automatically extract quantitative\nmeasures of LVEF from cardiac imaging studies within most electronic health records  and\n3  the non-specific coding patterns for cardiac dysfunction  e g  428 0 “congestive heart\nfailure  unspecified” accounted for the majority of HF/CM codes  codes such as 428 21\n“acute systolic heart failure” were rare  we were forced to use an automated HF/CM\nalgorithm that was indifferent to measures of left ventricular systolic function  Electronic\ndatabases in their present form and in the setting of current cardiac surveillance patterns are\nunlikely to allow for automated algorithms that can accurately distinguish between various\ntypes of cardiac dysfunction \n\nAlgorithm decisions regarding trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity are often\nchallenging and depend on the clinical setting to which the algorithm is applied  We can\nimagine situations where high specificity  reducing false positives  would be paramount and\nother situations where high sensitivity  reducing false negatives  would be the primary goal \nTherefore  we investigated 3 different algorithms purposely designed to optimize different\nperformance characteristics  We found that the balanced algorithm performed as expected\n Table 3  providing comparatively good sensitivity and specificity  and therefore we\nemphasized it in the remainder of the subanalyses  However  future investigations may wish\nto use a highly sensitive or highly specific algorithm as circumstances dictate \n\nThe variability in ICD-9 code frequencies for HF/CM within the 8 health delivery systems\nraises questions regarding the consistency of algorithm performance between institutions \nThere was nearly a 4-fold institutional difference in the frequency of both prevalent and\nincident HF/CM coding  However  these coding differences may  in part  reflect differences\nin institutional patient populations  Coding frequencies were concordant with the average\nage of the population treated by the institution  data not shown  For example  the site with\nthe highest frequency of HF/CM codes treated a patient population of whom 51% were over\n65 years of age  compared to the site with the lowest frequency of HF/CM codes which\ntreated a patient population of whom only 22% were over 65 years of age  Different\ninstitutional culture for claims-based coding may provide an alternative explanation for at\nleast part of these HF/CM coding differences  If the large degree of site-based variability in\nICD-9 coding is not primarily a reflection of differences in case mix  e g  age  this raises\nthe concern that claims-based algorithms may have to be evaluated and interpreted\nindependently for institutions with obviously different ICD-9 HF/CM coding practices \n\nAllen et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 May 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nAdditional Limitations / Considerations\nThe manual review of all records by trained abstractors with subsequent review of only\nselect abstracted data by a cardiologist is less rigorous than prior studies which have\ninvolved physicians for the entire process of chart abstraction  Other studies evaluating\nmethods for identifying patients with HF have used a variety of standard definitions for HF \nincluding Framingham criteria 25 However  due to a lack of echocardiographic data on all\npatients and limitations in the naturalistic collection and recording of many of the criteria\nused for Framingham criteria  e g  decrease in vital capacity by one third from maximum \nnocturnal cough  S3 gallop  hepatojugular reflex  we chose to use provider assessments as\nrecorded in the chart combined with what LVEF data was available to determine the\npresence or absence of HF/CM  In addition  the chart review was not prospectively designed\nto make a determination of prevalent versus incident HF/CM in relation to chemotherapy\nexposure  the distinction between prevalent and incident disease was before or after the date\nof breast cancer diagnosis  respectively  Finally  the collection of data in routine care lacks\nthe standardization and detail that is inherent to the conduct of a clinical trial  Therefore  the\ngold standard presented here may have a greater degree of misclassification than seen in\nsome prior studies  particularly for incident diagnoses  Prevalent disease was based on\nascertainment within the 12 months prior to breast cancer diagnosis  it is conceivable that\nmore prevalent disease would have been identified had we looked further backwards in time \nWe only reviewed claims and chart data in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis  Most\nadjuvant chemotherapy is given in the first year  and trastuzumab cardiotoxicity is thought\nto happen relatively acutely  However  it is well known that anthracycline cardiotoxicity can\noccur years after exposure  We did not assess for cardiotoxicity that developed more than a\nyear after cancer diagnosis  and therefore coding algorithm performance is unknown for\nlate-onset cardiotoxicity  Finally  due to the delayed and non-granular nature of\nadministrative claims data  such an algorithm has limited utility in real-time identification of\nindividual cardiac events \n\nConclusion\nThe claims-based ICD-9 algorithms tested here had moderate PPVs for HF/CM  Therefore \nclaims-based algorithms in the setting of routine care  without the addition of some form of\nmedical record review or other data enhancement  are crude tools for accurately estimating\ncardiotoxicity among women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer  In the future  health\ncare forces which promote greater standardization of ICD-9 coding and greater use of serial\ncardiac imaging with storage of LVEF measures in a way that allows for automated\nextraction from the electronic health record would improve the performance of automated\nelectronic algorithms for characterizing cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy in community-based\npopulations

treatment has been shown in randomized trials to result\nin improved recurrence-free and overall survival  Preoperative systemic therapy  PST   also\nknown as neoadjuvant therapy or induction therapy  has been utilized for patients with\nlocally advanced breast cancer and phase II studies suggest improved outcomes with this\nstrategy  PST has also been explored for patients with early stage operable breast cancer\nbecause this approach may offer some potential benefits  including opportunity to evaluate\nprognostic and predictive biological markers and opportunity for faster evaluation of newer\nregimens since responses can be directly observed  Randomized controlled trials show\nequivalent outcomes with adjuvant therapy or PST with the same agents  but the latter\nincreases the likelihood of breast conserving surgery being possible 1–3 PST also appears to\nbe associated with better patient compliance than adjuvant therapy 4\n\nResponse to PST correlates with long-term outcomes  Pathologic complete remission  pCR \nis has been shown to be strongly associated with improved overall survival  and may serve\nas a suitable surrogate endpoint 3 5 There is intense interest in evaluating newer regimens\nthat can improve pCR rates  which may translate into better survival  Most of the regimens\ntested for PST have included an anthracycline and / or a taxane in combination or sequence\nbecause of their demonstrated activity in adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer  pCR rates of\n8 –28% have been reported depending on the agent  combination  dose and duration of\ntreatment 6–9 Taxanes are one of the most active agents in breast cancer  Objective response\nrate up to 50% have been described in phase III studies of docetaxel in treatment naïve\nMBC 10 Single agent carboplatin also has considerable activity in BC with RR of 25 –\n37% 11 12 Docetaxel and carboplatin have synergistic activity and largely non-overlapping\ntoxicities and the combination was shown to be highly active with overall RR of 60% as first\nline therapy for metastatic breast cancer  including in anthracycline pretreated patients 13\n\nIn addition to evaluating novel agents  there is also interest in exploring whether treatment\nschedule can impact the activity of agents in neoadjuvant setting  The Gompertzian kinetic\nmodel of tumor growth  in which the rate of tumor growth is not constant but decreases as\nthe tumor increases in size after cytoreductive therapy  would predict that decreasing the\nperiod available for re-growth by more frequent administration of chemotherapy in a dose-\ndense schedule would lead to improved response rate  The CALGB Intergroup trial C9741\ndemonstrated improved disease-free and overall survival in patients with axillary node\npositive breast cancer who received adjuvant therapy with AC → T  paclitaxel  or sequential\nsingle agent use of these agents in a dose-dense  every 2 week  schedule compared with the\nsame drugs administered every 3 weeks 14 Dose dense scheduling is now an established\npractice in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer  Whether a similar approach will have\nenhanced efficacy as PST is unknown but available data suggest that dose dense therapy is\nfeasible with tolerable toxicity 15 16\n\nBased on the demonstrated efficacy of docetaxel and carboplatin as single agents and in\ncombination as well as the potential of further improving their activity by dose-dense\nscheduling  we conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 4 cycles\nof docetaxel and carboplatin administered every 14 days with pegfilgrastim support in\npatients with stage II–III breast cancer  Here we report the efficacy and toxicity of this\nregimen  describe the surgical experience and highlight some areas for investigation in\nfuture PST trials \n\nRoy et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 December 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA

histologically or\ncytologically confirmed stage II or III  T2–4  N1–3  invasive breast cancer were eligible for\nthis multi institution trial coordinated by North Central Cancer Treatment Group  NCCTG \nOther key eligibility criteria included ECOG performance status of 0–1  adequate organ\nfunction  ANC >= 1500 cells/mL  HgB >= 10 0 g/dL  PLT >= 100 000 cells/mL  creatinine\nclearance >= 30 mL/min  total bilirubin  = grade 2  clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastases excluding\nisolated supraclavicular lymph node involvement  and pregnant or nursing women  The\nstudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board of all the participating institutions\nand all patients gave informed written consent prior to entry into the trial \n\nTreatment Schedule\nStudy treatment consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC of 6 IV on day 1 and\npegfilgrastim 6mg SQ on day 2  Cycles were repeated every 14 days for a total of 4 cycles\nunless there was progression at any time  Step wise dose reductions in docetaxel  60 mg/m2\nand 45 mg/m2  and carboplatin  AUC 4 5 and AUC 3 4  dose were allowed per protocol for\ntoxicity  Treatment was delayed up to a maximum of 21 days if toxicities had not resolved to\nless than grade 2 prior to the start of next cycle  All patients received dexamethasone\npremedication before docetaxel and antiemetic prophylaxis per their physicians’ discretion \nPatients proceeded to definitive surgery after resolution of toxicity but within 42 days after\nthe 4th cycle of chemotherapy  Any treatment  chemotherapy or radiation therapy after\ndefinitive surgery was not specified in the protocol and left to the discretion of treating\nphysician \n\nResponse and Toxicity Criteria\nPathologic complete response was defined as disappearance of all invasive and in situ tumor\nin the breast and axilla after chemotherapy  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who\nreceived at least one cycle of chemotherapy were considered evaluable for response  If a\npatient failed to proceed to surgery they were considered not to have achieved pCR  Clinical\nresponses were also measured by physical examination and were to be confirmed with the\nuse of mammography  ultrasound  and/or MRI  A clinical complete response  cCR  was\ndefined as the disappearance of all measurable and/or evaluable disease from the breast and\naxilla by physical exam \n\nStatistical Design and Analysis\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving pCR  The study used a two-\nstage Simon design to test that the pCR rate was at most 15% versus the alternative\nhypothesis that the true pCR rate was at least 30%  with a significance level of P=0 11 and\n91% power  If there were at most 3 pCRs among the first 25 patients  the regimen would be\ndeclared ineffective and the trial would stop  Secondary endpoints included adverse event\nprofile  clinical response rate  percent of planned dose administered per cycle  We also\ncollected information to understand the surgical management of operable breast cancer\npatients who undergo PST  A specific surgical treatment was not mandated in the protocol\n\nRoy et al  Page

that axillary staging was required in all patients  The type of breast surgery  and\nspecifics of pre-operative or post-operative sampling were left to the discretion of the\ntreating surgeon  Surgical data were collected by retrospective chart review \n\nAll analysis was conducted on the intent-to-treat principle  The proportion of pCR is\nestimated by the number of patients who achieved a pCR divided by the total number of\nevaluable patients  Similarly  the proportion of other events such as clinical responses is\nestimated by dividing the number of patients who achieved the event in question by the total\nnumber of evaluable patients  Exact binomial CIs were constructed for all of the above rates \nAdverse event profile  percent of planned dose administered  and surgical data are presented\nusing simple descriptive statistics \n\nRESULTS\nFifty Seven patients were enrolled over a 22 month period in this multiinstitution trial  All\npatients were evaluable for response and toxicity  The median age of this all women cohort\nwas 53 years  range  27–79  Tumor size ranged from 2 – 15 4 cm  median 5 cm  Thirty-\neight  67%  had ER+  31  54%  PR+  and 6  11%  HER2+ BC  Nine  16%  patients had ER \nPR and HER2 negative cancer  Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1 \n\nFollow-Up\nAt the time of this report  all 57 women have completed pre-operative chemotherapy and\nsurgical treatment  Forty-eight  84%  completed the study per protocol  i e  they received all\n4 cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery within the protocol defined time  The\nremaining 9 women could not complete the study per protocol due to  disease progression\n 3  adverse events  3 – neuropathy  elevated liver enzymes  and multiple AEs that led to a\n3rd dose reduction of chemotherapy  MD discretion  2  and personal choice  1  A median\nof 4 cycles  range 1–4  of chemotherapy treatment was given  Fifty-one  89%  underwent\nsurgery with in 42 days of the end of chemotherapy  including 3 women who did not\nsuccessfully complete 4 cycles of chemotherapy  Median followup of surviving patients\nwas 38 months  2–57 months  The progression free survival rates were 89%  84%  and 76%\nat 1-year  2-year and 3-year  respectively  The overall survival rates at these time points\nwere 98%  96% and 89%  respectively \n\nSafety and Tolerability\nThe regimen was well tolerated  The only grade 4 toxicity was thrombocytopenia seen in 5%\nof subjects  The most common severe  grade 3 or higher  toxicities  possibly  probably  or\ndefinitely related to study drug  were decreased platelets  19%  fatigue  14%  anemia\n 9%  and diarrhea  7%  Other commonly experienced events regardless of grade were \nalopecia  93%  nausea  81%  bone pain  53%  myalgia  51%  and peripheral sensory\nneuropathy  51%  See Table 2 for more toxicity information  Fifty-two of the 57 patients\nreceived all 4 planned chemotherapy treatments  The median dose of docetaxel administered\nwas the protocol planned dose of 75 mg/m2  Sixteen patients required docetaxel dose\nreductions in 23 instances with the most common reasons being hepatic enzyme elevation\n 8  and other non-hematologic adverse events  7  The median dose of carboplatin\nadministered was the protocol planned dose of AUC=6  Four patients required carboplatin\ndose reductions in 4 instances because of  hand/foot syndrome  2  ALT elevation  1  and\nthrombocytopenia  1  One pegfilgrastim dose reduction occurred due to physician\ndiscretion  Treatment delay occurred in 15 patients  23 instances  most commonly due to\nthrombocytopenia  16 \n\nRoy et al  Page 4\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 December 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

surgical therapy was noted in axillary staging  Twenty  40%  had\naxillary staging prior to systemic chemotherapy  5 underwent sentinel lymph node  SLN \nbiopsy and 15 image-guided axillary biopsy  All the patients found to have a positive SLN\nor image-guided axillary biopsy prior to PST  had further axillary staging after PST  Those\nfound to be SLN negative pre-PST  had no further axillary surgery whereas those with\nnegative axillary evaluation by imaging and/or biopsy  underwent further axillary staging  1\npatient  after PST  Thirty  60%  had axillary staging after systemic chemotherapy  Of those \n17  67%  patients underwent SLN biopsy whereas 3  10%  presented with palpable axillary\nlymph nodes and underwent a complete lymph node dissection  The remaining patients\n n=10  33%  underwent a complete axillary lymph node dissection without documentation\nof palpable axillary lymph nodes at the initiation or completion of chemotherapy \n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this phase II multicenter trial we show that a two-weekly regimen of docetaxel and\ncarboplatin followed by pegfilgrastim is feasible as neoadjuvant therapy for breast\ncarcinoma  This regimen was associated with similar toxicity and pCR rates described with\nother anthracycline containing regimens  Thrombocytopenia was the only grade 4 toxicity\nseen in 5% of subjects  It was also the most frequent grade 3 adverse event seen in 14% of\nindividuals  See Table 2 for more details regarding toxicities  Fifty-two of the 57  91%  of\npatients were able to complete all four planned chemotherapy regimens although 17  29% \nrequired dose reduction  mainly in docetaxel dosing  due to toxicity  Ninety percent of\npatients were able to have surgery within 6 weeks of last chemotherapy and no increase in\nsurgical morbidity or complications was noted \n\nThe regimen was associated with a high rate of clinical responses  Nine of 57  16%  had a\ncomplete pathologic complete response and 4 of the 9 patients  44%  with triple negative\nbreast cancer achieved pCR  Different definitions of pCR have been used in the literature \nWe defined pCR stringently as absence of invasive and non-invasive cancer in the breast\nand axilla as recommended by a recent expert panel 17 Other investigators have defined pCR\nas absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast or lymph nodes  but residual DCIS is\nallowed 18–20 In a retrospective analysis of over 2000 patients  residual DCIS in patients\nwho experienced complete eradication of the invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes\ndid not adversely affect survival or local recurrence rate 21\n\npCR rate of 16% seen in our study is comparable to the rates seen in other studies that utilize\n4 cycles of anthracycline based therapy in 2 or 3 weekly schedule 1 3 5 7 15 22–24\n\nRoy et al  Page 5\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 December 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

cardiac toxicity is not a concern with\nthis regimen  longer duration of treatment  additional cycles of chemotherapy  for 6 or 8\ncycles may be possible at acceptable toxicity  The cytoreductive effect of intermittently\nadministered chemotherapy accumulates as additional cycles are administered  till a\nmaximum response is obtained  Thus  the number of chemotherapy courses in the\nneoadjuvant setting may have a significant impact on response  The optimal duration or\nnumber of chemotherapy treatments before definitive surgery is not known and is likely\ndependent on the characteristics of the tumor as well as the chemotherapy agents being\nutilized  However  there is some evidence in the literature that more than 4 cycles may be\nneeded for optimal response  In a randomized comparison of 6 versus 3 of epidoxorubicin/\ndocetaxel combination for stage II or III breast cancer  pCR rate of 36% compared to 10%\nwas seen after 6 cycles 25 Similar improvement in pCR  24% v 17%  and clinical response\nrate  32% v 20%  was noted with 6 versus 4 cycles of doxorubicin / paclitaxel administered\nas neoadjuvant therapy 26 In the Aberdeen trial patients received 4 cycles of CVAP and the\nresponders were randomized to receive either 4 more cycles of CVAP or 4 cycles of\ndocetaxel  Improvement in clinical response rate was seen in both cohorts  cCR was 14%\nafter initial 4 cycles of CVAP  33% after 4 more cycles of CVAP and 56% after 4 cycles of\nCVAP followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel 1 In our study we utilized 4 cycles of\nchemotherapy followed by surgery  It is possible that additional cycles of therapy may\nimprove clinical and pathological response rates but a large prospective trial will be required\nto evaluate that possibility \n\nTriple negative breast cancer  TNBC  is defined by lack of expression of ER  PR or HER2\noverexpression  This is a distinct subtype of breast cancer and this phenotype predicts a\nbasal-like gene expression profile with high sensitivity and almost 100% specificity 27\nTNBC exhibit several poor risk characteristics including high grade and proliferative index\nand have the poorest prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes 28 29 Impaired BRCA1 function\nand DNA repair mechanisms in TNBC may render them particularly susceptible to\nbifunctional alkylating agents and platinum compounds that act by creating interstrand DNA\ncross linkage 30 A pCR rate of 44% was noted in patients with TNBC in our cohort  A\nrecent study by Kern et al also found high pCR rates with carboplatin and docetaxel given\nevery 21 days for 6 cycles in their cohort of 13 patients with early stage breast cancer 31\nFurther studies are needed to confirm this finding in a larger cohort of TNBC patients \n\nTo summarize  4 cycles of 2-weekly carboplatin and docetaxel followed by pegfilgratim is\nan active regimen for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with acceptable toxicity\nprofile and leads to pCR rates similar to other anthracycline containing regimens  This\nregimen may be particularly attractive for patients who are not suitable candidates to receive\nanthracycline  An impressive high pCR rate of 44% was seen in TNBC  a finding that needs\nto be validated in larger prospective trials  Carboplatin / docetaxel combination may serve as\na chemotherapy backbone to combine with other targeted therapies in future trials \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was conducted as a collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group  NCCTG  and\nMayo Clinic and was supported in part by Public Health

\nMI\n\nAbstract\nBackground—Most data regarding medical care for cancer patients in the United States comes\nfrom SEER-linked Medicare analyses of individuals aged 65 years or older and typically excludes\nMedicare Advantage enrollees \n\nObjectives—To assess the accuracy of chemo- and hormone therapy treatment data available via\nthe Cancer Research Network’s Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW \nResearch Design—Retrospective  longitudinal cohort study  Medical record-abstracted  tumor\nregistry-indicated treatments  “gold standard”  were compared to VDW-indicated treatments\nderived from HMO pharmacy  electronic medical record  and claim-based data systems \n\nSubjects—Enrollees aged 18 years and older diagnosed with incident breast  colorectal  lung or\nprostate cancer from 2000 through 2008 \n\nMeasures—Sensitivity  specificity  and positive predictive value  PPV  were computed at six-\nand 12-months post-cancer diagnosis \n\nResults—Approximately 45% of all cancer cases  total N=23 800  were aged 64 years or\nyounger  Overall chemotherapy sensitivity/specificities across the three health plans for incident\nbreast  colorectal  lung  and prostate cancer cases were 95%/90%  95%/93%  93%/93%  and 85%/\n77%  respectively  With the exception of prostate cancer cases  overall PPV ranged from 86% to\n89%  Small variations in chemotherapy data accuracy existed by cancer site and data source  while\ngreater variation existed in hormone therapy capture across sites \n\nConclusions—Strong concordance exists between gold standard tumor registry measures of\nchemotherapy receipt and CRN VDW data  HMO VDW data can be used for a variety of studies\naddressing patterns of cancer care and comparative effectiveness research that previously could\nonly be

limited to the linked Surveillance  Epidemiology and End Results  SEER -Medicare\ndata  National Comprehensive Cancer Network  NCCN  studies  or randomized clinical\ntrials  RCTs   1–3  While several studies have documented the reliability of SEER-\nMedicare data to capture chemotherapy administration  4  5  SEER-Medicare data do not\ninclude details on treatment patterns and outcomes of cancer care for patients aged younger\nthan 65 years or those receiving their care in health maintenance organizations  HMOs \nFurthermore  detailed data on the use of antineoplastic agents are often captured only for a\nselect group of patients that are not representative of the broader population of cancer\npatients  5  6  Generalizable data are needed to conduct comparative effectiveness research\non treatment options commonly used in community-based oncology practices \n\nSuch data are potentially available from HMOs that participate in the National Cancer\nInstitute  NCI -funded Cancer Research Network  CRN   7–9  CRN HMOs compile and\nmaintain data from internal  automated information systems in a distributed data network\nentitled the “Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW ”  10  11  VDW encounter  claims  and\nelectronic medical record data have  in turn  been linked to validated tumor registry data\nderived from the abstraction of HMO enrollee charts using methods similar to  or in some\ncases equivalent to  SEER registries  http //seer cancer gov/  last accessed 01/03/2012 \nPrior CRN research using “Virtual Tumor Registry”  VTR  data linked to VDW data has\nfocused primarily on surveillance/screening  12–15  epidemiologic  16  17  and\nsurvivorship studies  18  19  However  the VDW also captures HMO enrollees’ use of\nantineoplastic agents and could therefore serve as a resource for population-based research\non treatment patterns  diffusion of new therapies  and costs associated with the cancer\ntreatment services provided in community settings for patients not currently represented by\ndata derived from SEER-Medicare or RCTs \n\nOne of the challenges to using HMO automated data is lack of published validation studies\nassessing the quality of automated data against a consistent gold standard  Health\ninformation systems vary across HMOs  different hardware platforms and software vendors \nand over time  upgrades to software and changes in vendors  Data derived from treatment \npayment  and operations sources are not collected under research standards  data are entered\nby a multitude of clinicians and staff members with little redundant entry to assess\nreliability  Many uncontrolled factors underlying treatment  payment  and operations data\ncreate a need for formal evaluation of the validity and reliability of these data \n\nTo validate the usefulness of CRN VDW data for the capture of chemo- and hormone\ntherapy treatment among cancer patients aged 18 and older  we assessed the sensitivity \nspecificity  and positive predictive value  PPV  of indicators of first-course chemotherapy\nand hormone therapies found in the CRN VDW compared to a “gold standard” of chart-\nabstracted measures of first course treatment contained in the tumor registries of three CRN\nHMOs \n\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Setting\n\nThis was a retrospective  longitudinal cohort study conducted within three non-profit HMOs\n[the Colorado

Network  NCI Cooperative Agreement No  U19 CA79689  and provides\ncomprehensive health services to its members  primarily through closed panel delivery\nmodels by salaried physicians  In each of these HMOs  the majority of ambulatory cancer\ncare is delivered in plan-owned facilities  This project was approved by the Institutional\nReview Boards of the three participating HMOs \n\nData Sources\nThe primary data source for this analysis was the CRN’s Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW \nThe VDW is a standardized data system in which CRN participating HMOs retain local\ncontrol of their data  but a programmer at one site can write a program than can be run at all\nsites  10  11  The Virtual Tumor Registry  VTR  contains standardized data derived from\neach CRN HMO’s tumor registry  The VTR contains data consistent with the North\nAmerican Association of Central Cancer Registries  NAACCR  standards  20  and includes\ninformation on each patient’s cancer site  sequence  diagnosis date  American Joint\nCommittee on Cancer  AJCC  stage  and receipt of primary chemotherapy  immunotherapy \nhormone therapy  and surgical and radiotherapy  that are obtained from manual reviews of\ncancer patients’ medical charts  Information from the VTR can be considered a gold\nstandard for cancer treatment information because data contained within the VTR were\ncollected by certified tumor registrars  CTRs  who review all elements of each patient’s\nmedical record  including pathology reports  imaging reports  infusion session summaries \nsurgical operation reports  physician orders  for chemotherapy and hormonal therapy  and\nclinician progress notes  For the three HMOs included in this study  two have internal\nregistries staffed with fulltime CTRs  neither are SEER sites  but both report NAACCR\nstandard cases and fields to their respective State registries  The third HMO receives tumor\nregistry data feeds  in NAACCR format  from the SEER Cancer Surveillance System  All\ndiagnosis and treatment data provided to health plan enrollees were available for medical\nrecord review by the CTRs  Some variation was observed across the CRN sites and over\ntime with respect to the capture of specific tumor registry variables  For example  not all\nCRN VTRs captured variables including date of first chemotherapy or hormone therapy\ntreatment for all years included in this study \n\nVDW diagnosis and procedure files include coded diagnoses and procedures associated with\ninpatient and outpatient encounters or events  These codes are based on International\nClassification of Diseases  9th Revision  Clinical Modification  ICD-9-CM  codes \nHealthcare Common Procedure Coding System  HCPCS  codes  or the Fourth Edition of the\nCommon Procedure Terminology codes  CPT-4  Greater than 90% of the VDW diagnosis\nand procedure data used in this analysis were derived from electronic medical records\n EMRs  These data capture the diagnoses and treatment associated with the chemotherapy\nevents that take place predominately in health plan owned ambulatory infusion centers \nClaims data included in these analyses were associated with cancer treatments administered\nby contract providers including hospital based care  VDW pharmacy files capture national\ndrug code  NDC  based prescription drugs dispensed from both outpatient pharmacies and\nHMO-owned infusion centers  VDW files  VTR  Procedure  Diagnosis  and Pharmacy  were\nlinked by programmers at the individual CRN sites using individual medical record\nidentifiers  These identifiers were then stripped from the analytic data sets prior to pooling\ndata for final analyses  In this analysis  and consistent with Warren et al  4  we focused on\nthe ability of the VDW to capture definitive first course chemotherapy and hormone therapy\nat 6 months following a patient’s incident cancer diagnosis date from four VDW files  VTR \nPharmacy  Procedures  and Diagnoses during the period of 01/01/2000 through 12/31/2008 \nGiven the potential for the delay in first course treatment  we repeated this analysis at 12\nmonths post incident cancer diagnosis \n\nRitzwoller

Sample\nCancer cases were identified in the VTR as individuals diagnosed with breast  colorectal \nlung  or prostate cancer between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2007  aged 18 or older at diagnosis \nand eligible for care in one of the three HMOs for the year prior to and including the date of\ndiagnosis \n\nIdentification of Chemotherapy\nCancer therapy “look-up” tables were created by extracting codes from published research\n 4  6  21  NCI websites  22  23  plan-specific formularies  and expert clinician opinion\n from medical Oncologists and pharmacists with doctoral level training practice primarily or\nexclusively in oncology settings  These look-up tables contain over 2 000 NDC and 300\nprocedure and diagnosis treatment-related codes  Please see Tables 4  5  and 6 \nSupplemental Digital Content 1  which contains the lists of codes included in this study  In\naddition  these tables are accessible via the CRN public website  http //crn cancer gov/ \nUsing these chemotherapy and hormone specific NDC  procedure and diagnosis codes \nvariables were created and stratified by class of product  chemotherapy vs  hormone\ntherapy  These lookup tables were then mapped to the VDW pharmacy  procedure  and\ndiagnosis files using individual medical record identifiers for all incident breast  colorectal \nlung or prostate cancer cases identified from the VTR  as noted above  If one or more\nchemotherapy-related or hormone therapy-related event was captured in the VDW files\nwithin the first six months following the incident diagnosis date then the patient was flagged\nas receiving therapy at six months  Similarly  if a chemotherapy-related event occurred\nwithin the first 12 months following the incident diagnosis date  then the patient was flagged\nas receiving therapy at 12 months  The first date of a VDW captured treatment event in one\nor more of the VDW files  pharmacy  procedure  or diagnosis  that occurred after the\nincident cancer diagnosis date noted in the VTR was considered the first chemotherapy or\nhormone therapy event  The chart-abstracted VTR data was extracted from each health plan\nfrom the “first course of chemotherapy  or hormone therapy ” variable  If the “first course\nchemotherapy” variable was coded as 01  02  or 03  chemotherapy  NOS  chemotherapy \nsingle agent  and chemotherapy  multiple agents  the patient was flagged as having received\nchemotherapy  Similarly  if the “first course hormone therapy” was coded as 01  “hormone\ntherapy including NOS and antihormone”  then the patient was flagged as having received\nhormone therapy treatment \n\nData Analysis\nFor each cancer case  we compared results from the VTR to results from the VDW for\nchemotherapy and hormone therapy  Due to the small number of cases across all cancers\nreceiving immunotherapy  n=111  we excluded immunotherapy from this analysis  For six\nand 12 months post cancer diagnosis  we computed sensitivity  proportion of those who\nwere flagged in the VTR as having received treatment and in the VDW as having received\ntreatment  specificity  proportion of those who were flagged in the VTR as NOT receiving\ntreatment and in the VDW as not receiving treatment  and PPV  proportion of those flagged\nas receiving treatment in the VDW who were correctly identified as receiving treatment by\nthe VTR  by cancer site  We then stratified the data by stage  HMO and year  Finally  we\nexamined variation in the sensitivity and specificity of the VDW data source  pharmacy\nversus procedure and diagnosis files  The pharmacy files capture dispensing of drugs to the\ninfusion unit or outpatient pharmacy  while the procedure and diagnosis files capture\nadministration of infusions \n\nRitzwoller et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care

study period  8 543 breast cancer cases  4 399 colorectal cases  4 713\nlung cases  and 6 145 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the participating CRN HMOs \nThe proportions of breast  colorectal  lung and prostate cancer cases diagnosed prior to age\n65 were 59%  37%  32%  and 42%  respectively  The distributions of incident cancer cases\nby health plan  cancer site  stage  and year of diagnosis  as well as the proportions of cases\nindicated by the VTR as receiving chemotherapy or hormone therapy are shown in Table 1 \nThe majority of breast and prostate cancer cases  in total and by health plan  were initially\ndiagnosed at early stages  while colorectal cases were more evenly distributed across all\nstages  Lung cancers were predominantly diagnosed at later stages  While not shown here \nthe distribution of cancer cases by health plan and diagnosis year was relatively stable  with\na slight linear increase  from 11 6% in 2000 to 14 2% in 2007  over the observation period \nWe were unable to link 0 3%  N=83  of the cancer cases identified in VTR to the VDW\nfiles \n\nChemotherapy Concordance\nSensitivity across all three HMOs was highest for breast  95 5%  followed by colorectal\n 95 1%  lung  93%  and prostate cancer  85 5%   Table 2  Specificity for breast \ncolorectal  lung  and prostate was 89 8%  92 6%  92 6%  and 76 6%  respectively  Positive\npredictive values were generally high  >86%  except for prostate cases  6 3%  Sensitivity\nand specificity varied slightly by health plan with overall measures of concordance the\nlowest for HMO A  Minimal variation in sensitivity and specificity was noted by stage or\nyear of diagnosis \n\nWhen the observation period post-diagnosis was extended to 12 months  the sensitivity\nincreased by 0 6 percentage points for colorectal and lung cancer cases and 0 4 percentage\npoints for breast cancer cases  no change was observed for prostate cancer cases \nSpecificity decreased for breast  colorectal  lung  and prostate cancer cases by 0 4  2 3  1 5 \nand 2 5 percentage points  respectively  data not shown \n\nTable 3 describes the changes in the sensitivity and specificity when the analysis was limited\nto either only VDW pharmacy NDC data  or only procedures and diagnosis codes associated\nfrom outpatient or inpatient encounters derived from the EMRs or claims data  Using\npharmacy data only  the largest percentage point decline in sensitivity was found for HMO\nA across all four cancers  34 4 – 54 6 percentage points  and for prostate cancers at HMO B\n 42 9 percentage point decline  However  specificity improved from 18 8 to 33 6 \npercentage points for the same cases  Using only diagnosis and procedure codes  minimal\nchanges were found for HMO A  but large percentage point declines in sensitivity across all\nfour cancer sites were found for HMO C  with no improvement in specificity  Moderate\ndeclines in the sensitivity  7 8 – 14 percentage points  were found for breast  colorectal and\nlung cases at HMO B \n\nHormone Therapy Concordance\nHormone treatment was noted in the VTR data for 4 903  107  33  and 1 706 breast \ncolorectal  lung  and prostate cancer cases  respectively  While specificity was high for all\ncancer sites and HMOs  consistent with the small number of cases receiving hormone\ntherapy  sensitivity was lowest for colorectal  49 5%  and lung cancer  48 5%  as compared\nto 72 3% for breast and 78% for prostate cancer  Table 4  In contrast to the chemotherapy\nanalysis  hormone treatment sensitivity increased 19 9 and 8 2% percentage points for breast\nand prostate cancer  respectively  when the observation period was extended to 12 months\npost diagnosis  data not shown  Concordance across cancers fell slightly when the analysis\n\nRitzwoller et al  Page 5\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 October 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nwas limited to pharmacy data  with the exception of breast cancer sensitivity  When the\nanalysis was limited to procedure and diagnosis data  the sensitivity fell 0 9 and 46 1\npercentage points for breast and prostate cancer  respectively  Due to the small number of\ncolorectal and lung cancer patients receiving hormone therapy  we did not estimate changes\nin sensitivity or specificity by source of data \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first evaluation of the consistency between gold-standard tumor registry data and\nautomated data derived from the CRN VDW with respect to chemotherapy and hormone\ntherapy use for HMO enrollees aged 18 years or older diagnosed with one of the four most\ncommon cancers in the United States  We found that CRN VDW data associated with coded\ndiagnoses  procedures and prescription drug use  when used in combination  have both high\n >90%  sensitivity and specificity for identifying chemotherapy use among breast \ncolorectal  and lung cancer cases relative to chemotherapy treatment data derived from the\nchart-abstracted tumor registries  This analysis extends the work of Aiello and colleagues\n 24  conducted in these same HMOs  which compared chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\npatients  based on CPT-4  NDC  and ICD-9-CM codes  to tumor registries and found an\noverall sensitivity of 89% \n\nDifferences found in sensitivity and specificity by HMO and by data source  pharmacy vs \nother  could be explained by the differences in source data systems  Two of the three HMOs\nhave “in-house” tumor registries employing trained full-time CTRs to conduct\ncomprehensive chart audits  while the third populated their VTR from automated SEER data\nfiles  The SEER derived data may be less complete than the “in-house” registries because\nSEER abstractors do not have continuous access to medical records  which increases the\nbarriers to additional updates beyond the initial chart review  Also consistent with the\nfindings of Aiello and colleagues  24  we found that using only one source of data  e g \npharmacy only  was insufficient for capturing pharmacologic treatment data  Two of the\nthree HMOs had equal capture of pharmacologic events from both the VDW pharmacy and\nutilization files  capture of both NDC and HCPCS or CPT-4 codes  for over 90% of the\ncases receiving chemotherapy  while the third captured chemotherapy events predominately\nfrom encounter based diagnoses and procedure files—less than 50% of the cases had a\nchemotherapy-related NDC code  This likely reflects differences in the organization of\npharmacy systems within the plan-owned infusion centers \n\nWe found the sensitivity of chemotherapy use capture could be improved only slightly   90% overall  Chemotherapy is frequently only\ninitiated in prostate cancer for advanced disease or with progression or recurrence  26  27 \n\nRitzwoller et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript

in the VTR received primary\nchemotherapy treatment  while 27% of cases within the VDW pharmacy or procedure data\nreceived chemotherapy within 12 months of the diagnosis date  The hormone therapy PPV\nvalues are consistent with use of a variety of treatment approaches that can be initiated at\nvarious times post-diagnosis 28 \n\nThere are several limitations associated with this study  We did not conduct chart reviews of\nfalse negative cases  indicated as having treatments from VTR data  but no VDW pharmacy \nprocedure  or diagnosis-related event  At least some of these cases likely reflect 3–5% of\ncancer patients  enrolled in these HMOs  who are participating in chemotherapy-related\nclinical trials  The health plan is not liable for the cost of the chemotherapy  nor is the trial\ndrug necessarily part of the health plan’s pharmacy formulary  Therefore  if the trial drug\nwas administered at a cancer center or by another contract provider  it would be noted in the\nchart abstracted tumor registry  but no claim would be generated  If the trial drug was\nadministered by the plan-owned infusion center  the trial drug may not be captured or\nincluded in the traditional pharmacy systems  In addition  the two health plans with internal\ntumor registries  non-SEER  generally perform chart abstraction on most cases within 6 to 8\nmonths of the cancer diagnosis date  However  the CTRs at these plans have continuous\naccess to the patient’s EMR  allowing for abstraction updates in cases when first course\ntreatment may be delayed by several months  This may result in a longer follow-up\nabstraction period relative to SEER registries  The potential for differences in SEER/non-\nSEER abstraction follow-up could also be the source of variation in specificities across\nhealth plans  Further  while we assumed that the first chemotherapy event following the\ndiagnosis date of one of the four cancers of interest corresponded to that cancer  we did not\nlimit cases to sequence 0  first incident cancer  It is therefore possible that we are\nidentifying cancer treatments associated with a previous cancer diagnoses  Future studies\nshould also explore product  or regimen-level specificities  sensitivities  and PPVs \nconsistent with Warren and colleagues 4  particularly as standardized electronic infusion\ntherapy record systems are deployed across the majority of the CRN HMOs  further\nimproving the quality and clarity of antineoplastic data \n\nRegardless of future data refinements  the results of the current multi-site analysis reveal\nthat CRN VDW-based cancer treatment data are as sensitive and specific as Medicare fee-\nfor-service claims data in identifying receipt of antineoplastic therapy—the dominant data\nsource used for research related to cancer treatment and outcomes  4  6  29  Furthermore \nthis study highlights the ability of the CRN VDW to capture hormonal and oral\nchemotherapeutics at a time when Medicare Part D pharmacy data are not currently\navailable via linked SEER-Medicare files  Finally  our study is one of a limited few that\nincludes a representative population of cancer patients under the age of 65 years  This\nunique  comprehensive  and reliable data source sets the stage for patterns of care analyses\nand comparative effectiveness research in community-based oncology settings that will\ninform policy and medical practice by enabling better understanding of similarities and\ndifferences in cancer epidemiology  treatment patterns  and outcomes between aged and\nnon-aged populations and between capitated and fee-for-service reimbursement systems \n\nAcknowledgments\nFunding for this research was provided by NCI Grant No  R01 CA114204  Medical Care Burden of Cancer  System\nand Data

detection rate is a benchmark measure of screening \nmammography quality  but its computation requires linkage of mammography interpretive \nperformance information with cancer incidence data  A Medicare claims-based measure of \ndetected breast cancers could simplify measurement of this benchmark and facilitate \nmammography quality assessment and research \n\nObjectives—To validate a claims-based algorithm that can identify with high positive predictive \nvalue  PPV  incident breast cancers that were detected at screening mammography \nResearch Design—Development of a claims-derived algorithm using classification and \nregression tree analyses within a random half-sample of Medicare screening mammography \nclaims followed by validation of the algoritm in the remaining half-sample using clinical data on \nmammography results and cancer incidence from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium \n BCSC \nSubjects—Female fee-for-service Medicare enrollees age 68 years and older who underwent \nscreening mammography from 2001 to 2005 within BCSC registries in four states  CA  NC  NH  \nand VT  enabling linkage of claims and BCSC mammography data  N=233 044 mammograms \nobtained by 104 997 women \nMeasures—Sensitivity  specificity  and PPV of algorithmic identification of incident breast \ncancers that were detected by radiologists relative to a reference standard based on BCSC \nmammography and cancer incidence data \n\nResults—An algorithm based on subsequent codes for breast cancer diagnoses and treatments \nand follow-up mammography identified incident screen-detected breast cancers with 92 9% \nsensitivity  95% CI  91 0%-94 8%  99 9% specificity  95% CI  99 9%-99 9%  and a PPV of \n88 0%  95% CI  85 7%-90 4% \nConclusions—A simple claims-based algorithm can accurately identify incident breast cancers \ndetected at screening mammography among Medicare enrollees  The algorithm may enable \nmammography quality assessment using Medicare claims alone \n\nKeywords\nBreast Cancer Screening  Mammography  Validation Studies  Medicare  Quality Assessment\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCore measures of mammography performance  such as recall rates and breast cancer \ndetection rates  vary widely across U S  radiologists and mammography facilities  1  In \naddition  despite an average recall rate in the U S  that is nearly twice that of most European \nnations  breast cancer detection rates after screening mammography are no higher in the \n\nFenton et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nU S  than in Europe  2  These findings point to potentially remediable gaps in the quality of \nU S  mammography services \n\nOne issue may be differences in radiologist mammography experience and annual \ninterpretive volume in the U S  vs  European countries  3  and some have suggested \nbenchmarks for screening mammography performance as a means of prompting radiologist- \nor facility-level efforts to improve interpretation  4  5  The Institute of Medicine has also \nemphasized the need for high quality measures of provider- and facility-level performance \nto guide targeted quality improvement efforts  6  The U S  Medicare program has a \nparticularly large stake in mammography quality improvement  Medicare pays for over 8 5 \nmillion mammograms each year at a cost of over $1 billion annually  7  and over half of \nincident breast cancers occur among women older than 65 years  8  Currently  Medicare \nreports facility-level performance of follow-up or recall rates as part of the Hospital Quality \nReporting Program  However  additional valid and reliable performance measures are \nneeded to facilitate broader scale improvement \n\nMedicare claims data are one potential data source for measuring mammography \ninterpretative performance  The breast cancer detection rate  for example  is a widely used \nmeasure of radiologist- and facility-level interpretive performance  a cancer detection rate of \n2 5 breast cancers per 1000 screening mammograms is considered a minimally acceptable \nperformance level  5  This measure  however  is challenging to implement  because it \nrequires accurate identification of  1  screening mammograms  2  subsequent incident breast \ncancers  and 3  screening mammography interpretation  With regard to identifying screening \nmammograms using Medicare data  we recently validated a claims-based algorithm for \ndistinguishing screening from diagnostic mammograms  9  The distinction between \nscreening and diagnostic is critical  because the incidence of breast cancer is much higher \nfollowing diagnostic than screening mammography  4  10  However  with regard to the \nsecond step  there has been uncertainty about the accuracy of claims for identifying incident \n rather than prevalent  breast cancers  11  12  Diagnosis codes for breast cancer are not \nspecific for incident rather than prevalent disease  and procedure codes for breast cancer \ntreatments  such as mastectomy  can occur when women are treated for either benign \nconditions or recurrent breast cancer  Finally  claims provide no direct information to infer \nwhether mammograms were interpreted as normal or abnormal  potentially limiting the \nability to infer that incident cancers were detected at screening mammography \n\nNattinger et al  previously validated a clinically informed  four-step algorithm for \ndistinguishing incident from prevalent breast cancers using Medicare claims data  13  \nRelative to a reference standard based on Surveillance  Epidemiology  and End Results \n SEER  cancer registry data  the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of ~80% and a positive \npredictive value of over 90%  However  the algorithm was not validated in a cohort \nundergoing screening mammography  so it is uncertain if the algorithm accurately identifies \nbreast cancers in a screening population  nor does the algorithm address screening \nmammography interpretation  Additionally  the algorithm was validated using data from \n1994  and it is uncertain if it achieves similar performance with more recent Medicare \nclaims \n\nFenton et al  Page 3\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01

Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium with Medicare claims to evaluate the \nperformance of claims-based methods for identifying incident breast cancer that followed \npositive screening mammography  We first assessed the performance the approach described \nby Nattinger et al   13  within a screening mammography cohort   Henceforth  we refer to \nthis as the Nattinger algorithm  We then assessed whether classification and regression tree \nanalyses could identify an alternative approach with improved performance  We \nhypothesized that claims-derived algorithms could identify incident cancers following true-\npositive screening mammography with high predictive value in recent Medicare claims \n\nMETHODS\nData\n\nWe used data from Medicare claims files  the Carrier Claims  Outpatient  and Inpatient files  \nand the Medicare denominator file  which provides demographic  enrollment  and vital \nstatus data  While Medicare mammography claims typically appear in the Carrier file  we \nassessed both the Carrier and Outpatient files to capture the minority of claims present only \nin the Outpatient file  ~3%   14  We used Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System \n HCPCS  procedure codes to identify bilateral mammograms and procedures occurring \nbefore and after mammography  Medicare claims also include International Classification of \nDiseases  9th Edition  Clinical Modification  ICD-9-CM  diagnosis codes  which we used to \nidentify breast cancer diagnosis codes and breast symptoms \n\nMedicare claims from 1998 to 2006 were linked with BCSC mammography data derived \nfrom regional mammography registries in four states  North Carolina  San Francisco Bay \nArea  CA  New Hampshire  and Vermont   http //breastscreening cancer gov/  Claims and \nBCSC mammography data were matched using a deterministic algorithm derived by the \nNational Center for Health Statistics that is based on social security numbers  when \navailable  names  and birthdates  Among women aged 65 years and older with a BCSC \nmammogram between 1998 and 2006  87% were successfully matched to Medicare claims  \nWomen who did not successfully match typically received mammography at facilities that \ndid not report social security numbers to the BCSC \n\nBCSC facilities transmit prospectively collected patient and mammography data to regional \nregistries  which link the data to breast cancer outcomes ascertained from regional or \nstatewide cancer registries and pathology data  Data are pooled at a central Statistical \nCoordinating Center  SCC  BCSC mammography data include information on examination \npurpose  screening vs  diagnostic  radiologist interpretation  and patient socio-\ndemographics and breast health history  The BCSC has

31  2005  We identified screening mammograms  distinguishing them from \ndiagnostic mammograms  using a validated claims-based algorithm based upon the HCPCS \nmammogram codes  claims for mammography in the prior nine months  and claims with \nICD-9-CM codes for breast cancer during the year prior to mammography  9  Relative to a \nBCSC-derived reference standard  the positive predictive value of the algorithm’s screening \ndesignation was ~95%  We used the claims-based algorithm  rather than BCSC data  to \nidentify screening mammograms so that results would be potentially generalizable to other \nMedicare claims-based studies where linkage of claims to mammography registry data is not \nfeasible \n\nWe selected mammograms for women with continuous enrollment in fee-for-service \nMedicare  parts A and B  for twelve months after mammography and three years prior to \nmammography  enabling both prospective assessment of outpatient claims for clinical events \nthat might indicate incident breast cancer following abnormal screening mammography  and \nretrospective assessment for claims indicating prevalent breast cancer  Hence  we excluded \nwomen aged 65 to 68 years because only women aged 68 years or greater consistently have \nthree years of prior claims  Following Nattinger  et al   13  we considered a woman to have \nprevalent cancer if any ICD-9-CM codes for invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-\nsitu appeared on claims in the three years prior to mammography  see Table  Supplemental \nDigital Content 1  which gives claims and diagnostic codes used in developing study \nvariables  Although some women with prevalent breast cancer continue to receive \nscreening mammography  we excluded these mammograms so that our sample represented \nwomen undergoing screening who had no breast cancer in the prior three years  We \nrandomly divided the sample into two half-samples  one for training and one for validation \nof classification and regression tree  CART  analyses \n\nReference Standard\nWe used BCSC cancer registry data to identify incident breast cancers and BCSC \nmammography data to identify radiologists’ mammography interpretation  We defined \nincident breast cancers as those with a diagnosis date within one year of the date of \nscreening mammography  Following standard BCSC definitions  available at  http //\nbreastscreening cancer gov/data/bcsc_data_definitions pdf  a positive mammogram was \ndefined as one with a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System  BI-RADS®  assessment \nof 0  needs additional imaging evaluation  3  probably benign finding  with a \nrecommendation for immediate follow-up  4  suspicious abnormality  or 5  highly \nsuggestive of malignancy 16  Mammograms with other BI-RADS® assessments were \ndefined as negative  because no immediate evaluation was recommended at the time of \nscreening mammography  A screen-detected breast cancer was defined as a positive \nmammogram with a diagnosis of incident breast cancer within one year \n\nFenton et al  Page 5\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\n\n\nClaims-Based Algorithms for Identifying Incident Screen-Detected Breast Cancers\nWe first adapted the Nattinger algorithm to identify incident breast cancers during the one \nyear following screening mammography  13  The Nattinger algorithm begins by identifying \n“high-probability” cases based on codes for breast cancer diagnoses and therapies during the \nyear following the index date  in this instance  the date of mammography  Next  the \nalgorithm attempts to exclude women treated for benign breast disease  cancers that were \nmetastatic to the breast  and  finally  women with prevalent breast cancer based on breast \ncancer diagnosis codes occurring during three years of claims prior to the index date  We \nclassified all cases identified by the algorithm as screen-detected incident cancers  Although \nwe recognize that the Nattinger algorithm was not designed to consider mammography \ninterpretation  we felt that it was valuable to evaluate its performance in the context of \nrecent screening mammography \n\nWe then conducted CART analyses in attempts to identify an algorithm with improved \nperformance  17  CART is a non-parametric decision tree methodology that identifies \nsequential binary partitions in independent variables to optimize prediction of the dependent \nvariable  in this case  incident breast cancer detected at screening mammography  A \npotential advantage is that CART can specify the best-performing time intervals following \nmammography for ascertaining breast cancer diagnosis or treatment codes following \nincident breast cancers that were detected at mammography \n\nPotential independent variables for CART analyses were derived from claims on the \nmammogram date or during a one-year post-mammogram follow-up  including  patient age  \ndays to any subsequent mammogram  days to diagnosis codes for breast cancer  ductal \ncarcinoma in-situ  benign breast tumors  secondary cancers of the breast  or a personal \nhistory of breast cancer  days to procedural or diagnostic codes for breast biopsies  days to \nany procedural codes for breast-directed surgery  lumpectomy  partial mastectomy  or \nmastectomy  axillary lymph node biopsy or resections  and days to any codes for breast \nradiation  18  19   See Table  Supplemental Digital Content 1  for claims and diagnostic \ncodes used in developing study variables \n\nWe performed CART analyses on the training half-sample of mammograms  The CART \nalgorithm selected splits in independent variables on the basis of the Gini index  and \ncontinued growing the tree until no further splits improved the Gini index by more than \n0 0001  17  To minimize over-fitting  we pruned the tree to optimal complexity based on \ncross-validation \n\nAnalyses of Classification Accuracy\nWithin the validation sub-sample  we created cross-tabulations to compare the identification \nof incident screen-detected breast cancers using claims-based algorithms versus the \nreference standard  We quantified accuracy using  sensitivity  the proportion of incident \nscreen-detected cancers that were identified by the algorithm  specificity  the proportion of \nmammograms without incident screen-detected cancers that were so classified by the \nalgorithm  positive predictive value  PPV  or the proportion of algorithmically-identified \nincident screen-detected cancers that were also classified as such by the reference standard  \n\nFenton et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nand negative predictive value  the proportion of mammograms classified as having no \nincident screen-detected cancer also classified as having no incident screen-detected cancer \nby the reference standard  As a practical test of the algorithm’s accuracy  we compared \nunadjusted relative rates of breast cancer detection as computed using the CART algorithm \nand BCSC data  i e  the reference standard  within subgroups based on age  race/ethnicity  \nnon-urban vs  urban residence  and Medicaid eligibility  A woman was classified as \nMedicaid eligible if the Medicare denominator file indicated at least one month of Medicaid \neligibility in the three years before or one year after the index mammogram  Non-urban vs  \nurban residence was determined using the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Code for the zip \ncode of the woman’s primary residence  We computed 95% confidence intervals around all \npoint estimates  We performed statistical analyses using the rpart package in R  version \n2 12 0  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Vienna  Austria \n\nRESULTS\nMammogram Samples\n\nWe identified a sample of 233 044 screening mammograms with linked Medicare claims \nand BCSC records  The mammograms were obtained by 104 997 women who received an \naverage of 2 2 mammograms during the study period  range  1-7  On the date of \nmammography  women had a mean age of 75 2 years  SD  5 3  range 68 to 104  Based on \nBCSC interpretation and cancer data  radiologists detected breast cancer on 1 384 of the \nmammograms  the breast cancer detection rate in the sample was 5 9 cancers per 1000 \nscreening mammograms  The patient sample was ethnically diverse with substantial \nrepresentation in both non-urban and urban settings  Table 1 \n\nPerformance of Claims-Based Algorithms\nUsing CART analyses  we identified a claims-based algorithm that classified women based \non whether breast cancers were detected as screening mammography  Figure 1  Assessing \nclaims for one year following screening mammography  the algorithm classifies a \nmammogram as having detected breast cancer if there is a claim diagnosis code for breast \ncancer within 123 days and any claim for breast-directed surgery within one year  \nAlternatively  if there is no claim diagnosis code for breast cancer within 123 days  the \nalgorithm classifies a mammogram as having detected incident breast cancer if there is a \nclaim diagnosis code for ductal carcinoma in-situ within 286 days and a claim for another \nmammogram within 82 days  The algorithm classifies all other mammograms as not \ndetecting incident breast cancer   See Supplemental Digital Content 2 for programming code \nfor implementing the algorithm in R \n\nWe compared the performance of the Nattinger algorithm and the CART-derived algorithm \nin identifying incident breast cancer detected at screening mammography  Table 2  While \nthe Nattinger algorithm had a sensitivity of 83 75%  a specificity 99 86%  and a PPV of \n77 45%  the CART-dervived algorithm had a sensitivity of 92 89% and slightly higher \nspecificity  99 93%  Although small  this difference results in fewer cases falsely classified \nas detected breast cancers using the CART-derived algorithm as compared to the Nattinger \nalgorithm and a higher PPV  88 03% vs  77 45%   \n\nFenton et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIn analyses stratified by age  race/ethnicity  Medicaid eligibility  and non-urban vs  urban \nresidence  estimates of relative rates of incident detected breast cancer using the algorithm \nwere similar to reference standard estimates based on BCSC data  Table 3 \n\nDISCUSSION\nIn a sample of screening mammograms with corresponding Medicare claims and \nmammography registry data  a claims-based algorithm identified screening mammograms \nwith detected incident breast cancers with a sensitivity greater than 90%  a specificity over \n99 9%  and a PPV of 88%  Algorithm performance was generally similar across population \nsubgroups and enabled accurate estimates of between-group relative rates of incident breast \ncancer detection \n\nBoth the CART-derived algorithm and the algorithm proposed by Nattinger  et al  had very \nhigh specificities compared to the BCSC-derived reference standard  13  A high specificity \nis crucial for a cancer detection algorithm  With a rare outcome such as breast cancer  even a \nslight decrement in specificity could markedly diminish the measure’s PPV  as the number \nof false-positives may quickly accumulate in comparison to the number of true-positives  \nNevertheless  sensitivity is also important to PPV  In this screening mammography cohort  \nthe PPV of the CART approach  88 0%  exceeded that of the Nattinger approach  77 5%  \ndue to a combination of slightly higher specificity and higher sensitivity  93 9% vs  83 7% \n\nThe PPV of 88 0% for the CART approach implies that approximately 1 of 9 cancers \nidentified by the algorithm as incident detected breast cancers are wrongly identified as \nsuch  In the validation set  this included 87 cases  of a total 116 522 mammograms  As \nshown in Figure 1  most of these false-positives occurred among women with breast cancer \ndiagnosis codes within 123 days and breast-directed surgery within one year of screening \nmammography  Using BCSC data  we found that ~36%  n=31  of these women had interval \nbreast cancers that were not detected at screening mammography yet were diagnosed \nclinically within 365 days of screening  Additionally  we found that a small fraction of \nexams  <13%  had breast cancer diagnosis codes on claims but ultimately had benign biopsy \nresults  providers for these women may have used breast cancer diagnosis codes while \n“ruling out” breast cancer   Specific numbers suppressed to protect subject confidentiality  \nDespite exclusion of mammograms for women with breast cancer diagnosis codes on claims \nduring the three prior years  a small fraction of mammograms  <13%  were performed on \nwomen with prevalent breast cancers based on BCSC data and who received breast-directed \nsurgery during the year following screening mammography  conceivably for local \nrecurrences \n\nMeanwhile  the algorithm did not identify 7 1% of women whose breast cancers were truly \ndetected at mammography  49 of 689 detected incident cancers in the validation set  As \nshown in Figure 1  many of these women may have had delays in the appearance of \ndiagnostic codes for invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-situ or delays in receipt of \neither breast-directed surgery or subsequent mammography  Nattinger et al  similarly found \nthat a small fraction of women with incident breast cancer according to SEER data did not \n\nFenton et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nreceive breast cancer surgery  these women were more likely than women who received \nsurgery to lack breast cancer diagnostic codes in Medicare claims  13 \n\nWe recognize that cut-points in the CART algorithm may seem arbitrary  such as the initial \nnode in which a breast cancer diagnosis code is assessed as occurring within 123 days of \nscreening mammography  While there is no clinical justification for this cut-point  it yields \nthe optimal classification of cases as assessed by the Gini index and validated in a testing \nsub-sample  Thus  a shorter or longer cut-point would compromise overall classification \naccuracy  most likely with degradation in PPV  At the same time  we believe the general \nstructure and flow of the decision tree is clinically intuitive as one would expect diagnosis \ncodes for breast cancer with subsequent procedure codes for treatment to be reliable \npredictors of incident breast cancer  The assessment for procedure codes for subsequent \nmammography among women with diagnosis codes for ductal carcinoma in-situ is perhaps \nless intuitive  although most women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in-situ will \nindeed receive diagnostic mammography within 82 days of screening mammography \n\nSeveral potential uses of the CART algorithm are conceivable  First  the algorithm may be \nuseful in claims-based studies of screening mammography outcomes  including studies of \nnew screening technologies  such as digital mammography or computer-aided detection  on \nincident breast cancer detection  Because the algorithm does not require linkage with cancer \nregistry data  investigators may apply it in unlinked Medicare claims  enabling sample sizes \nthat would not be achievable with linked data such as the SEER-Medicare data  Second  the \nalgorithm could conceivably enable claims-based estimation of radiologist- or facility-level \nquality metrics  specifically breast cancer detection rates  facilitating quality improvement \nefforts in mammography among Medicare enrollees  We recognize that the algorithm’s PPV \nof ~88% does not confer certainty regarding a provider’s true-positive interpretation  The \nalgorithm may nevertheless allow identification of provider’s with extremely low breast \ncancer detection rates  In any application  investigators must carefully consider potential \nimpacts of algorithmic misclassification on study results and plan suitable sensitivity \nanalyses \n\nAlthough BCSC data on whether breast cancers were detected at mammography may be \nimperfect  leading to inaccuracy in the reference standard  the BCSC mammography data \nundergo rigorous quality control and are linked with high-quality regional cancer registries  \nOur results also derive from mammography claims of fee-for-service Medicare enrollees \nwithin four U S  regional mammography registries  Algorithms may not generalize to non-\nMedicare claims or to Medicare enrollees outside these regions  Because study algorithms \nrequire three years of prior claims to exclude prevalent breast cancers  their validity among \nwomen younger than age 68 years is uncertain  We also recognize that CART analyses may \nbe prone to over-fitting  Nevertheless  our analysis included variables that are clinically \nmeaningful  and we cross-validated the CART-derived algorithm within the training sample  \nWe also pruned the tree based on theory and practice  and the final tree was highly \npredictive in the test sample  Finally  in late 2014  Medicare will transition from ICD-9 to \nICD-10 coding  While the mapping of the algorithm’s breast cancer diagnosis and procedure \ncodes should be unambiguous  the performance of the algorithm would ideally be re-\nevaluated after the transition to ICD-10 \n\nFenton et al  Page 9\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nStudy strengths include the inclusion of large mammography claim samples from \ngeographically diverse settings that were linked with high-quality external mammography \ndata  yielding rigorous validation analyses with excellent precision  Because cancer \nregistries such as SEER encompass only 25% of the U S  population  20  the alternative \nalgorithms may enable mammogram sampling for research or quality improvement across \nthe entire Medicare program regardless of claims linkage with cancer registry data \n\nWe found that a simple  Medicare claims-based algorithm can identify with high predictive \nvalue women with incident breast cancers following a positive screening mammogram  \nApplied to Medicare claims alone without cancer registry linkage  the algorithm may be \nuseful in claims-based studies of screening mammography  The potential for using the \nalgorithm in provider-level quality assessment warrants evaluation \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFunding

code-set offered even moderate\nsensitivity  ≤19% \nConclusions—Secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes could not identify\nrecurrent cancer without some risk of misclassification  Findings based on existing algorithms\nshould be interpreted with caution  More work is needed to develop a valid algorithm that can be\nused to characterize outcomes and define patient cohorts for comparative effectiveness research\nstudies \n\nIntroduction\nCancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States  accounting for\napproximately 600 000 lives lost per year 1 While some cancer deaths are attributable to\nprogression of the primary disease  many  if not the majority  are due to recurrent metastatic\ncancer that develops among patients who previously completed definitive therapy and were\ndeclared disease free 2 Patients with recurrent metastatic cancer may differ significantly\nfrom those with primary metastatic cancer  because they previously received cancer-directed\ntherapy  have co-morbid medical conditions from their prior disease or treatment  have a\ndifferent distribution or extent of disease  or have different goals and values  Reliably\nidentifying patients with recurrent cancer would facilitate efforts to compare the\neffectiveness of treatments given at the time of recurrence and would permit the use of\nrecurrence-free-survival as an outcome in comparative effectiveness research studies \n\nTumor registries generate extensive information about patients with de novo metastatic\ndisease  but they cannot do as much to illuminate the experiences of patients with recurrent\nmetastatic disease because they do not have robust mechanisms for identifying recurrence \nSome tumor registries  such as those available from SEER  Surveillance  Epidemiology and\nEnd Results  and the Cancer Research Network  CRN  have been linked with\nadministrative data and used to assess cancer patients’ patterns-of-care and outcomes 3-9\n\nBelieving that these large  longitudinal  population-based datasets could also provide\nvaluable information about recurrent cancer  investigators have developed algorithms that\nuse the administrative codes for secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy to\nidentify patients with recurrent disease  While a number of studies have used these codes to\nindicate which patients have recurrent cancer10-13  few have assessed their validity as\npotential indicators of recurrence \n\nIn a 2002 study of 89 acute myeloid leukemia patients treated at a large cancer center  Earle\nand colleagues14 assessed the ability of inpatient procedure codes for the administration of\nchemotherapy to identify relapse after a treatment gap of at least four months  N=22\npatients  The algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 86%  a specificity of 99%  and a PPV of\n95%  In a study of 45 patients with node-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant\nchemotherapy as part of a clinical trial  Lamont and colleagues15 tested the ability of\nsecondary malignant neoplasm codes to identify disease-free survival  N=12 patients  At\nfive years of follow up  the algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97% \nwith an area under the receiver operator characteristic  ROC  curve of 0 97 \n\nHassett et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available

patients with specific cancer types  The\nvalidity of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes in less selected cohorts\nand across multiple cancer types remains uncertain  Our goal was to test and validate these\ntwo previously published recurrence detection algorithms using two larger  more\nrepresentative samples  Further evaluation of the methods currently being used to identify\npatients who have recurrent cancer is needed to ensure that our beliefs about this population\nare accurate  If administrative data fail to identify all patients who truly have recurrence or\ninappropriately classify patients as having recurrence the resulting misclassification could\nlead to erroneous conclusions \n\nMethods\nPotential Indicators of Recurrence\n\nThe codes that we tested as potential indicators of cancer recurrence included the secondary\nmalignant neoplasm codes described by Lamont and colleagues15 and the chemotherapy\ncodes described by Earle and colleagues14  The secondary malignant neoplasm codes\nincluded the International Classification of Diseases-Version 9-Clinical Modification\n ICD-9-CM  diagnosis codes for disease involving specific organ sites  i e  197-198 82 15\nAs described by Lamont and colleagues  the code for secondary malignant neoplasm at the\nsite of the original cancer was excluded as an indicator of recurrence  e g  when looking for\nrecurrence after a lung cancer diagnosis  the code for secondary malignant neoplasm of the\nlung [197 0] was excluded  because we could not determine whether it referred to recurrent\ndisease  the original caner  or a new primary  Also similar to the previous study  we\nconducted a sensitivity analysis in which we evaluated the impact of adding the secondary\nmalignant neoplasm codes for lymph nodes and other non-specific sites  i e  196 and\n198 89  to see if they improved sensitivity  The chemotherapy codes included generic\ncodes for the administration of anti-cancer agents and specific codes for cytotoxic and\ntargeted medications commonly used to treat cancer  Similar to the algorithm described by\nEarle and colleagues14  we included ICD-9-CM  Current Procedure Terminology  CPT \nHealthcare Common Procedure Coding System  HCPCS  Diagnosis-Related Groups\n DRG  revenue center  and Berenson-Eggers Type of Service  BETOS  codes [see Table \nSupplemental Digital Content 1  which provides a complete list of all codes used]  To\nimprove sensitivity  we added National Drug Codes  NDC  and to improve specificity we\nexcluded hormonal therapy medications  because they are frequently used as part of\nprolonged adjuvant therapy or for non-oncologic indications  and some chemotherapy\nmedications that are rarely used to treat recurrent cancer  e g  topical 5-fluorouracil  To\navoid the chance that chemotherapy given for adjuvant purposes would be construed as\nindicative of recurrence  we excluded chemotherapy occurring within 6 months of the index\ndiagnosis for lung cancer and within 12 months for breast and colorectal cancer  These\n“blackout” periods were based on the duration of standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens\nand a review of contemporary patterns-of-care  Finally  we assessed the performance\ncharacteristics of the two code-sets combined  i e  either secondary malignant neoplasm or\nchemotherapy codes \n\nHassett et al  Page 3\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 October 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nData Sources\nWe assessed the validity of these codes using two datasets that linked administrative codes \nwhich provided potential indicators of recurrence  with information abstracted from the\nmedical record  which provided gold standard recurrence status  One dataset contained\npatients cared for in a fee-for-service setting  CanCORS/Medicare  and the other contained\npatients cared for in a health maintenance organization-based Cancer Research Network\n HMO/CRN  We hypothesized that a code-based algorithm would be a more sensitive\nindicator of recurrence when applied to the fee-for-service versus the capitation\nenvironment \n\nCanCORS/Medicare—The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance\n CanCORS  Consortium is a large  prospective  population and health-system based study of\nthe care provided to and outcomes experienced by patients from across the United States\nwith lung and colorectal cancer diagnosed 2003-2005  The CanCORS dataset includes\ninformation from surveys of patients or their surrogates  and from the abstraction of\npatients’ medical records  Details of the study design  population  and data collection\nprocedures have been described elsewhere 16 After obtaining institutional review board\npermission  and with the consent of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nCanCORS records were linked with Medicare claim files from 2002-2007  The Dana-\nFarber/Harvard Cancer Center institutional review board provided oversight for the\nCanCORS/Medicare portion of this project \n\nHMO/CRN—The CRN is a consortium of 14 health care organizations affiliated with the\nHMO Research Network and the National Cancer Institute  http //crn cancer gov/  The\nCRN's Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW  was the primary data source for this analysis \nDescribed in detail elsewhere17 18  the VDW is a distributed data system using standard data\nformats and definitions where each HMO retains local control of its data  but a central\nprogrammer can direct extraction and analysis of data across all participating sites  It\nincludes data on patient demographics  health plan enrollment  SEER-compatible tumor\ncharacteristics  and cancer treatments  For this analysis  we used data from the two\nHMO/CRN sites that have “in-house” tumor registries staffed by certified tumor

Patients with no documented recurrence who died from causes\nother than cancer were considered non-recurrent \n\nFor the CanCORS/Medicare sample  patients had to be continuously enrolled in Medicare\nParts A & B from the month of cancer diagnosis to 18 months later or death  whichever\ncame first  where continuous enrollment was defined as no more than 2 consecutive months\nwithout enrollment  Patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans were excluded out of\nconcern that their claims data were incomplete  Patients had to have at least one Medicare\nclaim to ensure they were seeking care for their index cancer  Medical record abstraction\ndata were used to characterize patients’ gold-standard recurrence status  The suggestion of\nrecurrence in a radiology report  without confirmation in a clinician's note  was not\nconsidered sufficient to indicate recurrence  Characteristics of the patients  e g  age  race/\nethnicity  education  income  co-morbid diagnoses19 20  etc  and their diagnoses  e g  stage \ngrade  etc  were derived from the medical record abstraction and patient/surrogate survey\nfiles  Administrative codes were extracted from the Medicare hospital

each\nMedicare code the “claim through date” was used for all files except MedPAR where the\ndischarge date was used \n\nThe HMO/CRN database  unlike CanCORs/Medicare  continuously enrolls patients  For this\nanalysis  the HMO/CRN cohort included incident cancer cases diagnosed between January\n1  2000 and December 31  2005  Cases were linked to enrollment  census  pharmacy \nprocedure  and diagnosis data from 12 months prior to the incident cancer diagnosis until\ndeath  disenrollment  or the end of the study period  December 31  2008  Gold standard\nrecurrence status was ascertained by tumor registrars during routine chart surveillance\nefforts  Characteristics of the patients and their diagnoses were ascertained using the VDW\ntumor registry  census  pharmacy  procedure  and

malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes\nas potential indicators of recurrence for patients with lung  colorectal  breast  and prostate\ncancer  Excluding patients who did not complete definitive local therapy or who had\nprimary progressive disease allowed us to focus on patients for whom we thought recurrence\ndetection would be less challenging  Even so  for patients with lung  colorectal  and breast\ncancer secondary malignancy codes offered a sensitivity of only 56%-74% and\nchemotherapy codes offered a sensitivity of only 28%-62% across different time-points and\ndatasets  The combination of secondary malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy codes yielded\nmore desirable sensitivities  75%-85%  and specificities  70%-88%  but there was still\nroom for improvement  No code-set detected recurrent prostate cancer reliably  To our\nsurprise  there was no consistent difference in the results from the fee-for-service\nenvironment of Medicare compared with the capitation environment of the CRN \n\nThere are several reasons why our findings may differ from those published previously  It is\nnot surprising that chemotherapy codes were better at identifying patients who received re-\ninduction chemotherapy for AML compared to patients with recurrent solid organ\nmalignancies 14 Many patients with recurrent lung  colorectal  breast  and prostate cancer do\nnot receive chemotherapy at the time of recurrence  some are treated with another modality\nof therapy  e g  hormonal therapy  radiation therapy  surgery  etc  and others receive no\ncancer-directed therapy at all  Our cohort differed substantially from that described by\nLamont and colleagues15  which only included patients with node-positive breast cancer\nwho were ≥65 years old and had participated in a clinical trial  Even when we restricted our\nanalysis to patients with stage II-III breast cancer the secondary malignant neoplasm codes\nstill appeared to be less sensitive  65%-78%  than previously reported  Documentation of\nthe administrative codes used as potential indicators of recurrence may have been more\nlikely among clinical trial participants  patients receiving care at institutions that offer\nclinical trials  those who were ≥65 years old  or those who were treated in the more distant\npast  Several studies have assessed the ability of administrative codes to identify patients\nwho developed either recurrent or second primary cancer 21 22 While these studies reported\nsensitivities and specificities that were high  the use of a combined outcome  i e  recurrence\nor second primary cancer  makes it hard to assess how well these algorithms would detect\nrecurrence alone \n\nHassett et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 October 01

recurrent\ncancer  First  secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes alone offered\ndisappointingly low sensitivities  To improve sensitivity  it may be necessary to add\nadditional indicators  such as imaging  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy  or hospice\ncodes  Some codes  such as those for imaging and hospice  could be particularly helpful at\nidentifying patients who receive no cancer-directed therapy at the time of recurrence \nSecond  in light of the observation that cancer-type affected the performance characteristics\nof billing/encounter codes  developing one recurrence detection algorithm that works for all\ncancer types may be impractical  An alternate approach would be to start with an all-\nencompassing list of codes for common solid organ cancers  and selectively exclude those\nthat reduce specificity and do not increase sensitivity on a cancer-by-cancer basis  Third \nidentifying patients who have recurrent disease is not enough  it is also important to\ncharacterize the time when recurrence occurs  Finally  it is hard to identify a specific\nthreshold for sensitivity and specificity that should be considered good enough  The optimal\nthreshold may depend on the goal of the analysis  including whether it is more important to\noptimize sensitivity or specificity  If used alone  an algorithm with a low PPV could result in\nmisclassification such that efforts to make comparisons across groups would yield biased\nestimates of statistical parameters such as odds ratios \n\nOur results are limited by the potential for inaccuracies when classifying patients’ gold-\nstandard recurrence status  Given the stringent definitions used to identify gold-standard\nrecurrence status  the risk of inappropriately classifying patients as non-recurrent according\nto the gold-standard is greater than the risk of inappropriately classifying patients as\nrecurrent  Findings from the CanCORS/Medicare cohort are limited by relatively short\nfollow-up  however it was reassuring that the 14- and 60-month findings from the\nHMO/CRN cohort were similar  Some of the codes used to indicate recurrence can also be\nused to document initial cancer care  e g  adjuvant chemotherapy  regional lymph node\ninvolvement  etc  We tried to address this issue by excluding chemotherapy codes that\noccurred within 6 months after a lung cancer diagnosis or within 12 months after a\ncolorectal/breast cancer diagnosis  the optimal “black-out” window is unknown  Unlike one\nof the original studies15  we assessed the performance of administrative codes as indicators\nof recurrence alone  not recurrence or death  Given the small number of deaths in our cohort\nand the pattern of code documentation  changing the outcome to include death would likely\nhave had either no impact or a negative effect on sensitivity and specificity  The large\nsample size  different cancer types  and various practice settings included in our analysis are\nimportant strengths \n\nInvestigators who use secondary malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy codes to identify\ncancer recurrence should be aware of their potential for misclassification  The optimal\nthresholds for sensitivity and specificity can be determined only by investigators in\nconsideration of their individual research goals  but there does appear to be room to improve\nthe performance of currently available recurrence detection methods  While secondary\nmalignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes may be suboptimal for some investigators \nthey do offer potential and could serve as the foundation for a more sophisticated recurrence\nalgorithm that incorporates additional indicators and accounts for the primary cancer type23 \n\nHassett et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author

characterization of recurrence status  yes versus no  it\ncould be more useful to develop a flexible tool that generates a probability of having\nrecurrence in a defined time period  Continued efforts to develop an algorithm that identifies\nrecurrent cancer using administrative data are worthwhile  because while success may not be\nassured the alternative  asking registries to track recurrence status  would likely be cost\nprohibitive  A well-validated  claims-based algorithm could provide valuable information\nabout the experiences and outcomes of the many patients with recurrent cancer and help\nrealize the full potential of administrative databases for comparative effectiveness research \n\nLIST OF SUPPLEMENTAL DIGITAL CONTENT\n\nSupplemental Digital Content 1 – Table – Provides a

 In light of policies to increase access to screening  this study identifies differences in\nfactors associated with screening among immigrant and native-born women in 2000 and 2008 \nData from immigrant and native-born women aged 40+ years in the 2000 and 2008 National\nHealth Interview Surveys were included in descriptive and multivariate regression analyses \nMammography rates rose from 60 2 to 65 5 % among immigrant women  remaining lower than\nthe 68 9 % rate among native-born in 2008  Among immigrants  short length of residency and\nlower education were associated with lower screening rates in 2000 but not in 2008  while public\ninsurance coverage was positively associated with screening only in 2008  In contrast to\nimmigrants  among the native-born education and income were associated with mammography\nreceipt in 2008  and in both groups health care access was associated with greater screening rates \nPolicy initiatives aimed at increasing access to mammography may be positively affecting\nimmigrant screening disparities  Access to primary care and public insurance coverage are likely\nto be very important in maintaining and furthering improvements in mammography rates \n\nKeywords\nMammography  Immigrants  Health care access  Cancer screening\n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in American women [1]  and\nregular mammography screening is an effective strategy for early detection that has been\nassociated with significantly reduced mortality [2  3]  Immigrant women are less likely than\nnative-born to report having a recent mammogram [4–7]  as well as to receive repeated\nmammography screening in accordance with recommended guidelines [6  8]  This is\nespecially concerning since the number of immigrants has grown rapidly in recent years [9] \nand they currently comprise over 12 percent of the U S  population [10]  Over the past\n\n© Springer Science+Business Media New York

research  a range of factors have been associated with lower likelihood of\nmammography receipt among immigrant women including shorter length of residence in the\nU S  [5  7  14  15]  lack of citizenship status [5  16]  lower educational attainment and\nincome [6  15]  and reduced healthcare access [6  15]  It is not known  however  whether\nthese associations are currently present in light of recent policy changes aimed at increasing\naccess to screening  Healthcare contexts in which mammographic screening behavior takes\nplace are continually changing  and many public health agencies and medical/cancer centers\nin major immigrant destination cities are taking steps to facilitate the delivery of breast\ncancer screening service to newcomer populations  These include programs at Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center  NYU Langone Medical Center  Penn Abramson Cancer\nCenter  UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center  and the University of Chicago\nComprehensive Cancer Center  as well as services provided through the National Breast and\nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program  which was first implemented in the 1990s [17–\n22]  Because these programs specifically target recent immigrants  based on evidence that\nlarge disparities in breast cancer screening occur in this group [23]  the previously observed\nassociation between shorter duration of residence and lower rates of screening receipt might\nbe expected to become attenuated over time  Fear of being turned away based on legal status\nmay also be declining since these programs are geared toward welcoming immigrant\nwomen  thereby lessening the perception that lack of citizenship is a barrier to screening \nSubsidized screening programs such as National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection\nProgram that focus on low-income populations may also facilitate the decoupling of\nassociations between mammography receipt and indicators of SES and healthcare access \n\nTo better understand factors associated with mammography screening receipt  this study\nanalyzes population-based samples of women participating in the National Health Interview\nSurvey  NHIS  in 2000 and 2008  The first research objective is to examine whether\ndifferences exist in associations between demographic  socioeconomic  and healthcare-\nrelated factors and recent mammography receipt among immigrant women in 2000 and in\n2008  Because screening rates among immigrant women continue to lag behind those of\nother women [4]  a second objective is to compare and contrast patterns of association\nbetween these factors and recent mammography receipt among immigrant and native-born\nwomen in 2008 \n\nMethods\nStudy Population\n\nThe National Health Interview Survey [24] is an annual  cross-sectional household survey\nthat collects information on a variety of socio-demographic and health indicators  When\nweighted  NHIS data can be considered to be representative of the native-born civilian\npopulation and immigrants who understand English or Spanish  since survey administration\nis limited to these two languages  Undocumented immigrants and those speaking other\nlanguages are not likely to be fully represented  This study analyzes data from the 2000 and\n2008 waves of the NHIS \n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 2\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript

individuals from 38 633 households\n response rate = 90 %  [25]  The 2008 sample consisted of 74 236 persons living in 28 790\nhouseholds  response rate = 85 %  [26]  Women aged 40 years or older who were born\noutside of United States and who answered mammography screening questions were\nidentified in the 2000 and 2008 waves of NHIS and included in the analyses as immigrants \nThe study sample was comprised of 1 330 and 1 083 immigrant women in two study\nperiods  respectively  and 8 882 and 6 321 native-born women  Sample sizes for subgroups\nof interest are shown in Table 1 \n\nOutcome Variable\nRates of mammography receipt within the past 2 years were calculated for immigrants and\nnative-born women at both time points  Having a mammography within the past 2 years or\nnot is used as outcome variable in logistic regression analysis  To determine if\nmammography was conducted within this interval requires information about the date of or\ntime since the last mammogram as collected by survey questions  Two questions in different\nformats were asked in the 2000 survey  and an extra question was asked in the 2008 survey \nIn the 2000  respondents were asked  “When did you have your most recent mammogram ”\nRespondents could answer by providing the date of their last mammogram or the amount of\ntime since their last mammogram  for example 10 days ago  8 weeks ago  15 months ago  or\n3 years ago  In 2008  respondents could also answer by choosing time intervals  ≤1 year\nago  >1 year but ≤2 years ago  >2 years but ≤3 years ago  >3 years but ≤5 years ago  or>5\nyears ago  In order to study temporal changes in mammography use  we ignored any extra\ninformation collected in 2008 to calculate mammogram rates in 2000 and 2008  This ensures\nthe same computational procedures are used across years  and is the procedure followed in\nprevious research on this topic [4] \n\nPredictor Variables\nDemographic characteristics  socioeconomic status  health insurance coverage  and health\nstatus are entered as independent variables in the multivariate models  Table 1  with\nselection based on previous research on access to cancer services [27]  The specific\npredictor variables included in the models are \n\n1  Age group  Because mammography rates have been shown to vary by age and be\nmost optimal among women ages 50–64 [4]  women were classified into age\ngroups 40–49  50–64  and 65 years and older \n\n2  Race/ethnicity  Disparities by race/ethnicity in mammography receipt are of great\npolicy interest generally [28  29]  and specifically among the immigrant population\n[7  30]  Women were classified by self-report as either Hispanic  non-Hispanic\nwhite  non-Hispanic black  non-Hispanic Asian  American Indian  or

age-adjusted mammography rates among immigrant\nand native-born women in 2000 and 2008  Overall  mammography rates rose from 60 2 % in\n2000 to 65 5 % in 2008 among immigrant women  Their rates remain lower than the rates\nfor native-born women  although the gap narrowed considerably over time  from 11 2 % in\n2000 to 3 4 % in 2008  We found that mammography rates were markedly lower among\nrecent immigrants who had been in the U S  for less than 10 years compared to those who\nhad been in U S  longer in 2000  39 3 % versus 64 7 %   displayed in the third and fourth\nrows of Table 1  This gap narrowed by 2008  55 7 % versus 67 9 %  but remained\nsubstantial and statistically significant \n\nOther results of descriptive analyses specific to immigrant women are also shown in the\nlower section of Table 1  Recent mammography rates among immigrant women varied by\nmany of the demographic and healthcare access characteristics examined  Immigrant women\naged 50–64 had much higher mammography rates than women aged 40–49 in both 2000 and\n2008  In fact  in 2008 immigrant women aged 50–64 had higher mammography rates than\nthe overall rate among native-born women  Non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black\nimmigrants had higher mammography rates than Hispanic immigrants in 2000 but not in\n2008  Immigrants with U S  citizenship status also had significantly higher mammography\nrates than non-citizen immigrants in 2000 but not in 2008  Immigrants without a high school\neducation had the lowest mammography rates in both 2000 and 2008  Immigrants with\nfamily income over 200 % federal poverty level had significantly higher mammography\nrates than other lower income groups in 2000  however in 2008 rates by income status were\nnot statistically significantly different  Mammography rates did not vary significantly by\nself-reported health status in either 2000 or 2008  although rates were lowest among\nimmigrant women reporting fair or poor health  Insured immigrants had higher\nmammography rates than uninsured immigrants in both 2000 and 2008  Immigrant women\nwho had a usual source of care  who saw/talked a general physician  or who saw/talked to an\nOB/GYN in past 12 months had higher mammography rates than other immigrant women\nboth in 2000 and 2008 \n\nResults of multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for survey design presented in\nthe first column of Table 2 show factors significantly associated with receiving\nmammography among immigrant women 40 years or older in 2000  Five factors were\nsignificantly associated with recent mammography use  holding all other variables constant \nThe odds that recent immigrants receive timely mammography screening were 53 % lower\nthan the odds for other immigrants  The odds for high school graduates were over twice as\nhigh as the odds for women without a high school education  The odds of mammography\nreceipt for immigrant women having private health insurance were 84 % higher than the\nodds for uninsured immigrant women  The odds for immigrant women who had seen a\ngeneral physician or OB/GYN in past 12 months were nearly twice and over 5 times higher \nrespectively  than the odds for immigrant women who had not done so \n\nIn 2008  the patterns of factors significantly associated with mammography use among\nimmigrant women were different in several respects  as seen by comparing the first 2\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 5\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 August 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

 while age and having a usual\nsource of care were significant predictors  Holding all other variables constant  the odds of\nrecent screening for immigrants age 50–64 are 72 % higher than the odds for women age 65\nor older in 2008  The association between public insurance and mammography receipt was\nalso significant at the later time point  and the odds for immigrant women having private\nhealth insurance or public health insurance were two and a half times and three times as\nhigh  respectively  as those for uninsured immigrant women  The odds for immigrant\nwomen having a usual source of care were also over twice as high as those for immigrant\nwomen who did not have a usual source of care  The odds for immigrant women who have\nseen/talked to a general physician or OB/GYN in past 12 months were significantly higher\nthan the odds for other immigrant women  Race/ethnicity  citizenship status  poverty status \nand self-reported health status were not significant predictors of recent mammography use\namong immigrant women in 2000 or 2008  once other factors were taken into account \n\nThe factors associated with mammography use among immigrants were similar in many\nways to the significant factors for native-born women in 2008  comparing the second and\nthird columns of Table 2  In both groups  better access to health care was associated with\nhigher odds of receiving mammography  although having private insurance and a usual\nsource of care more strongly increased the chances of receiving mammography among\nimmigrant women compared to native-born women  Other factors affecting native-born\nwomen’s mammography use  including family income level  educational level  and self-\nreported health status  did not significantly influence immigrants’ receipt of mammography \nInterestingly  mammography receipt among both native-born and immigrant women did not\nvary significantly by race/ethnicity once other covariates are controlled \n\nDiscussion\nDisproportionately low rates of breast cancer screening rates among immigrant women in\nthe U S  have been of persistent concern [5  7  15  30]  and have spurred policy efforts to\nincrease access to mammography in this population  In view of these policies  as well as the\nfinding by Breen et al  [4] that screening rates appear to have improved among more recent\nimmigrants  this study sought to examine factors currently associated with mammography\nreceipt among immigrant women and whether these factors differ from those that were\nimportant for this group in the past  Our multivariate analyses of NHIS data found that there\nwere indeed differences in screening-related factors in 2008 compared to 2000  Most\nsaliently  longer length of residence in the U S  and higher education level  which had been\nassociated with greater likelihood of mammography receipt in 2000  were not significantly\nassociated at the more recent time point  Moreover  public insurance coverage  which had\nnot previously been associated with screening receipt  was significantly related in 2008  This\nparallels changes in legislation that allowed states to offer access to breast cancer-related\nservices through Medicaid [18]  and suggests that such coverage is a key component of\nstrategies to improve access to screening \n\nIn 2008  immigrants continued to lag behind in mammography receipt  and to inform the\ndevelopment of tailored interventions for these women a second objective of the present\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 6\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript

associated with screening among immigrant and\nnative-born women  For the native-born  socioeconomic characteristics including higher\nincome and educational attainment were associated with mammography receipt  however\nthese factors would not currently distinguish those immigrant women who have a greater\nlikelihood of being screened  It was the case that having graduated from high school was\nsignificantly associated with screening receipt among immigrants in 2000  but paradoxically\nhigher levels of education were not significantly associated with screening  suggesting that\nthe effect may not have been due to education per se but rather some other unmeasured\nfactor associated with having a high school diploma at that point  In 2008  measures of\nhealth care access including having a usual source of care and a recent visit to a general\nphysician or Ob/Gyn were important predictors for immigrant women  This finding suggests\nthat mammography rates can be improved by enhancing recent immigrants’ primary health\ncare  In order to further improve breast cancer screening rates  medical/cancer center-based\nimmigrant health initiatives may need to reach out to recent immigrants in partnership with\ncommunity organizations to improve primary care \n\nResults among immigrant women showing greater mammography receipt among those\nrecent immigrants and a stronger positive impact of public insurance coverage in 2008\nsuggest that programs and initiatives such as the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early\nDetection Program that target these groups may be having a beneficial effect on screening\ndisparities  The possibility exists  however  that other differences besides these initiatives\ncould have influenced the study findings  For example  differences could be present in the\nnational origin and ethnicity of immigrants in the U S  at the two time points which might\ninfluence the results  A report from the Center for Immigration Studies analyzing 2000 and\n2010 Census Bureau data  however  indicates that while the absolute numbers of immigrants\nliving in the U S  have increased  the proportion of the population from each of the top 10\nsending countries was very similar at each point [35]  Similarly  the 2000 and 2008 NHIS\nsamples might differ in characteristics that influence the study results  While this possibility\ncannot be ruled out entirely  it is the case that the racial/ethnic composition of the samples is\nsimilar  as is the distribution of preferred language [24] \n\nThere are several additional limitations in this study  The NHIS data is self-reported  rather\nthan obtained by objective methods such as medical record review  Prior studies  however \nhave found good correspondence between objectively determined mammography rates and\nrates based on self-report [36]  English or Spanish language requirements for participating in\nthe NHIS may have resulted in the exclusion of some groups of immigrant women including\nrecent immigrants and undocumented immigrants who lack preventive health care  and as a\nresult the findings are not likely to be representative of all immigrant women  English/\nSpanish fluency may also affect the ability of women to understand and accurately respond\nto the NHIS questionnaire items  Grouping immigrant women together in the multivariate\nanalyses may also have obscured important differences  such as by birthplace and race/\nethnic background [30]  For example  some recent studies have explicitly documented\nvariation in cancer screening among US immigrant subpopulations including Blacks \nHispanic  and Asian women [37–40]  An additional limitation relates to lack of data on\nfactors that could potentially impact mammography receipt  such as legal status  country of\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 7\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 August 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\norigin and related cultural beliefs  Subgroups of immigrant women may have different\ncultural beliefs that impact their use of mammography in different ways [41]  It should also\nbe borne in mind that there is variation in professional recommendations for mammography\nscreening internationally [42] as well as in the U S  with the American Cancer Society\nrecommending biennial screening beginning at age 40 [43] and the U S  Preventive Services\nTask Force recommending age 50 as the starting point [44] \n\nThe above limitations notwithstanding  the study findings suggest several conclusions  First \nimmigrant women remain less likely than others to receive recommended mammography\nscreening  and initiatives such as the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection\nProgram that target these groups may be having a beneficial effect on screening disparities \nFurther evaluation of the impact of such policy interventions among immigrant women is\nwarranted  Second  access to primary care and public insurance coverage are associated with\ngreater likelihood of mammography receipt  among immigrant women as well as the native-\nborn  This suggests that access to primary care and maintaining the availability of such\ncoverage will be very important to efforts to identify breast cancer cases at early stages that\nare the most successfully treated  Finally  differences in the pattern of factors associated\nwith mammography receipt among immigrant and native-born women suggest that tailored\ninterventions are needed  Focusing solely on low SES as an indicator of risk may fail to\nidentify substantial numbers of immigrant women in need of mammography screening \n\nReferences\n1

Background—Researchers are increasingly interested in using observational data to evaluate \ncancer outcomes following treatment  including cancer recurrence and disease-free survival  \nBecause population-based cancer registries do not collect recurrence data  recurrence is often \nimputed from health claims  primarily by identifying later cancer treatments after initial treatment  \nThe

likely to have had a recurrence  We selected \nnewly diagnosed stage II/III colorectal  CRC n=6 910  and female breast cancer  n=3 826  \npatients during 1994–2003 who received initial cancer surgery  had a treatment break  and then \ndied from cancer in 1994–2008  We reviewed all claims from the treatment break until death for \nindicators of recurrence  We focused on additional cancer treatment

outcomes such as recurrence and \ndisease-free survival  DFS  following cancer treatment  Population-based cancer registries \ncollect information about all incident cancers reported within defined geographic areas and \nsome registries also conduct follow-up of their patients to determine vital status  However  \nregistries do not collect or report information on cancer recurrence  Registry collection of \nrecurrence and timing of recurrence data would be logistically challenging and very costly  \nCurrently information on recurrence has been limited to data reported from clinical trials  \nwhich include only small numbers of patients and are not representative of cancer patients \noverall \n\nTo overcome the lack of recurrence information in the cancer registry data  researchers have \nused health claims to impute recurrence and DFS for cancer patients by identifying claims \nfor cancer treatment or metastatic disease after the initial treatment period  Validations of \nimputed recurrence from claims against medical records have been limited by very small \nsample sizes and lack of generalizability 1 2\n\nDespite the lack of population-based validation  a number of studies have used health claims \nto impute cancer recurrence 3–10 These studies have primarily defined recurrence through \nalgorithms that have identified surgery  chemotherapy or radiation therapy  RT  administered \nbeyond the time of initial treatment  as reported on Medicare claims  This approach will \nmisclassify patients if they do not receive treatment for their recurrence  a particular concern \nfor elderly patients who are not offered or may decline additional cancer treatment  To date  \nthere has been no population-based assessment of the sensitivity of Medicare claims for \nidentifying recurrences from treatment-based algorithms \n\nIn this study  we used the linked SEER-Medicare data to assess the sensitivity of Medicare \nclaims to capture recurrence for patients diagnosed with Stage II/III colorectal  CRC  or \nfemale breast cancers  We chose these cancers and stages because they are common and \nthese patients are likely to undergo initial curative treatment  with a sizeable percentage \nhaving cancer recurrence following their initial care \n\nAlthough the SEER-Medicare data do not explicitly capture recurrence  we identified \npatients very likely to have had a recurrence  those with only a single cancer diagnosis who \nwere surgically treated  had a cancer treatment-free interval  and later died from their cancer  \nOur assessment included reviewing Medicare claims for possible indicators of recurrence \nfollowing initial care  Our primary focus was whether claims for additional cancer treatment \n defined as surgery  chemotherapy and RT  were sensitive indicators of whether a patient \nhad a recurrence  We assessed if there was variation in the characteristics of patients who \nreceive additional treatment for recurrence  In addition  we assessed if other measures-- \ndiagnosis codes for metastasis or end-of-life care-- were sensitive indicators of recurrence  \nFor an indicator of recurrence to be useful for studies of disease-free survival  it must be \nreported accurately near the time when the recurrence was first diagnosed  Therefore  we \nalso examined the timing of each of the indicators in relation to time of diagnosis and death \n\nWarren et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

National Cancer Institute’s  NCI  Surveillance  Epidemiology and End \nResults  SEER  registries to Medicare claims 11 The SEER data are population-based and \ninclude clinical information about incident cancer for patients living within defined \ngeographic areas  representing approximately 28% of the US population 12 For each patient  \nthe SEER data contain a unique case number  demographic information such as age  sex and \nrace  the number of primary incident cancers  month and year of diagnosis  type of surgery \nperformed  site and stage of disease at diagnosis  and vital status  For patients who died  \ninformation about the month and year of death and underlying cause of death was obtained \nfrom the National Death Index  Cause of death on death certificates is reportedly \nindependently of diagnoses reported on claims  The Medicare data used in this analysis \ninclude all inpatient hospitalizations  outpatient hospital services  physician services  durable \nmedical equipment claims  and hospice service for beneficiaries with fee-for-service \ncoverage  All files include dates of service and codes for specific diagnoses and procedures \nusing either ICD-9-CM codes  Health Care Procedure Codes  HCPCS  or National Drug \nCodes  NDC  For persons reported to SEER who were age 65 or older  94% have been \nlinked to the Medicare enrollment file  Using the linked SEER-Medicare data allowed us to \ntrack patients across time from cancer diagnosis until death  The NIH's Office of Human \nSubjects Research has determined that the SEER-Medicare data are exempt from human \nsubjects regulations \n\n Sample selection\nThe cohorts included all beneficiaries ages 65 and older who were diagnosed between 1994 \nand 2003 with Stages II or III CRC  n=18 127  or female breast cancer  n=8 173  as their \nonly primary cancer who also died of cancer between 1994 and 2008  Patients identified \nonly from death certificates or autopsy were excluded  CRC n=30  breast n=11  To ensure \nthat all claims were available  patients were required to be enrolled in Medicare Part A and \nPart B coverage and not in an HMO from the month of their diagnosis until death  excluded  \nCRC n=5 560  breast n=2 514  All patients were required to have received cancer-directed \nsurgery as initial treatment within 4 months of their cancer diagnosis  Cancer-directed \nsurgery was identified from Medicare claims  If no surgery could be identified from the \nMedicare data  then surgery was identified from the SEER data  Patients without cancer-\ndirected surgery were excluded  CRC n=2 160  breast n=1 085 \n\n Identification of Surveillance Period to Ascertain Recurrences\nTo identify the “surveillance period”  the time after initial treatment when recurrences could \nbe identified  we reviewed health claims from cancer diagnosis until death  For each patient  \nwe divided the claims after diagnosis into three periods  initial treatment  treatment-free \ninterval  and surveillance  Figure 1  The initial treatment period started on the date of \ncancer-directed surgery as reported on the Medicare claim or  if cancer directed surgery was \nonly identified from the SEER data  and no date of service was available  the last day of the \nmonth of diagnosis  Many patients received adjuvant therapy following their surgery  and as \n\nWarren et al

M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\na result  the ending date for the initial treatment period for patients receiving adjuvant \ntherapy was later than for those who only had surgery  To determine whether a patient \nreceived adjuvant therapy  we reviewed Medicare claims for 4 months following the date of \nsurgery to identify bills for chemotherapy or RT  If adjuvant therapy was not identified  \npatients were defined as having surgery only and their initial treatment period was defined as \n4 months after the date of surgery  For patients who received adjuvant therapy  we reviewed \ntheir claims for up to 12 months following the date of surgery to determine when their \nadjuvant treatment ended  defined as no claims for chemotherapy or RT for 90 consecutive \ndays  The date from the last adjuvant treatment claim was the end date of their initial \ntreatment period  Patients could have a break in adjuvant treatment of up to 60 days  \npotentially reflecting adverse events from chemotherapy or a short term delay  We excluded \npatients with a break in treatment of more than 60 days but less than 90 days because we \ncould not determine if the resumption of treatment after an extended break reflected \nadditional initial therapy or treatment for recurrent disease  We also excluded patients whose \ninitial treatment extended beyond 12 months  CRC n=3 467  breast n=737 \n\nThe treatment-free interval was defined as 90 days following the end date of the initial \ntreatment period  Following the last date of the treatment-free interval  patients entered the \nsurveillance period  The surveillance period extended until the last day of their month and \nyear of death  The surveillance period was the focus of our study for reviewing indicators of \nrecurrence \n\n Indicators of Recurrence\nDuring the surveillance period  we reviewed Medicare hospital  physician  outpatient facility \nand durable medical equipment claims for additional cancer therapy-chemotherapy  RT  or \ncancer-related surgical procedures  Our evaluation did not include hormone therapy for \nbreast cancer patients as most elderly breast cancer patients initiate hormone therapy at the \ntime of diagnosis and continue treatment for five years following diagnosis  We also \nreviewed claims for metastasis diagnosis and end-of-life care  including services such as \nhospice care and pain management  A complete list of diagnoses and procedures used for \neach indicator of recurrence can be found in the Appendix  Table \n\n Defining the Time of Recurrence\n First Indicator of Recurrence—We reviewed claims to determine which indicator of \nrecurrence was found as the first indicator  Because more than one indicator could occur \nsimultaneously  we created a mutually exclusive hierarchy for defining the first indicator  \nadditional therapy  diagnosis of metastatic disease  or end-of-life care  Some patients with a \nmetastasis diagnosis as their first indicator may have been referred shortly thereafter for \nadditional treatment  Therefore  we reviewed their claims to determine if they received \nadditional therapy within 2 weeks of the metastasis diagnosis  If additional therapy was \nidentified  we classified the first indicator as being “additional therapy” rather than a \nmetastasis diagnosis  We also determined the number of patients with no indicator of \nrecurrence \n\nWarren et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\nGiven increasing interest in measuring disease-free survival  we compared the median time \nfrom diagnosis until recurrence for each first indicator of recurrence  We also estimated for \neach first indicator the median time from recurrence until death  Median times are presented \nin forest plot graphs  showing variation in median time by reporting the lower and upper \nquartiles  We report median times instead of mean times  as the means were skewed by \noutliers \n\n Assessing Patient Factors Associated with Receipt of Additional Therapy\nBecause prior studies have used receipt of additional cancer treatment to impute \nrecurrence 3–10 we calculated the percent of patients who had additional treatment at at any \ntime during the surveillance period  We used separate multivariate logistic regression \nmodels to assess the association between stage at diagnosis  patient age  race or sex and \nreceipt of additional treatment for CRC and breast cancer patients  All analyses were \nperformed using SAS software  version 9 2  SAS Institute Inc  Cary  NC \n\n RESULTS\nThe final cohort included 6 910 CRC patients and 3 826 breast cancer patients   Table 1  \nSixty-four percent of CRC patients and 56 6% of breast cancer patients were age 75 and \nover  Most CRC patients presented with Stage III cancer  59 7%  whereas most breast \ncancer patients presented with stage II  74 2%  To evaluate potential biases introduced by \nour cohort selection  we compared the age at diagnosis for patients in our cohort with all \nelderly CRC and breast patients in the SEER-Medicare data who had the same clinical \npresentation and years of diagnosis but did not die from cancer  The age distributions for the \ntwo cohorts were similar  although those who died from cancer were slightly more likely to \nbe age 75+ than those who did not die  CRC-64 1% vs  59 9%  breast cancer-56 7% vs  \n53 1%  Following diagnosis  mean survival for CRC patients was 34 3 months  with a mean \nof 25 9 months in the surveillance period  For breast cancer patients  mean survival was 45 6 \nmonths with 37 0 months in the surveillance period \n\n First indicator of recurrence\nFor both CRC and breast cancer patients  slightly more than one-third had additional therapy \nas their first indicator of recurrence  the type of additional therapy varied by cancer site and \nstage  Table 2  A diagnosis of metastatic disease  without additional therapy within 2 \nweeks  was also a common first indicator  reported in 36 0% of the CRC patients and 45 7% \nof the breast cancer patients  The remaining patients either had no indicator of recurrence or \nthe first indicator was end-of-life care  25 2% and 19 1% for CRC and breast cancer patients  \nrespectively \n\n Patient characteristics associated with additional cancer treatment\nThe percentage of patients ever having a claim for additional cancer therapy at any time \nduring the surveillance period was similar for CRC and breast cancer patients  60 0% and \n62 2%  respectively  data not shown  Patient characteristics were associated with receipt of \nadditional

\nsite  stage at diagnosis  and indicator  Figure 2  For both CRC and breast cancer patients  \nthose with additional therapy as their first indicator of recurrence had shorter median times \nto recurrence than for those with other first indicators  For CRC patients  both metastasis and \nend-of-life indicators occurred about 2 months later than additional therapy  while for breast \ncancer patients  metastasis indicators and end-of-life indicators were found about 5 and 7 \nmonths later than additional therapy indicators  A reverse pattern was observed for the \nmedian time from the first indicator of recurrence until death  Figure 3  The longest median \nsurvival following first indicator of recurrence was observed for patients whose first \nindicator was additional treatment  while the shortest median survival was for patients with \nend-of-life care as the first indicator  7 months shorter for CRC patients and 10 months \nshorter for breast cancer patients \n\n DISCUSSION\nIn this study  we assessed the sensitivity of the Medicare claims to detect cancer recurrence \nin patients who received initial cancer directed treatment  had a treatment-free interval  and \nlater died from their cancer  Our results demonstrate that algorithms that rely only on \nascertainment of additional cancer treatment to identify recurrence will significantly \nunderestimate its frequency  Less than 40% of CRC and breast cancer patients had additional \ntreatment as their first indicator of recurrence and about a third never had additional \ntreatment reported in the Medicare claims  Patients who do not receive additional cancer \ntreatment were primarily persons ages 70 and older and for CRC  women  These findings \nsuggest that prior studies that have relied on additional treatment codes in the SEER-\nMedicare data to impute recurrence are systematically misclassifying recurrences  \nparticularly for elderly populations  and the findings should be interpreted cautiously  3–10\n\nWhile this study was conducted in CRC and breast cancer patients  we do not believe that \ntreatment-based algorithms would have better performance for patients with other \nmalignancies  Indeed  we expect that treatment-based algorithms would have poorer \nperformance for prostate cancer  Because a sizeable number of prostate cancer patients \neither do not receive any therapy at diagnosis  or receive hormone ablation therapy as \nprimary or neoadjuvant therapy  it is difficult to identify whether claims for additional \ntherapies such as surgery or RT represent primary therapy or secondary therapy at \nrecurrence \n\nMetastasis codes were found to be a frequent first indicator of recurrence in our analysis  \nPrior studies have reported a relatively low positive predictive value  PPV  of metastasis \ncodes on claims for identifying metastatic disease in the SEER-Medicare data  ranging from \n58–66% for breast cancer and 64–69% for colorectal cancer 13–15 Although the addition of \nmetastasis codes will improve the sensitivity of treatment-based algorithms for identifying \n\nWarren et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript

patients will be incorrectly classified as having metastatic \ndisease when they do not  Thus  we conclude that metastasis codes on Medicare claims are \nnot an accurate way to identify recurrence \n\nAbout 25% of CRC patients and almost 20% of breast cancer patients either had no indicator \nof recurrence before death or had end-of-life care  shortly before death  as their first \nindication of recurrence  For these patients  there is no way to infer from claims when \nrecurrence was first diagnosed \n\nThis study has a number of strengths  We developed a definition of initial treatment that \nconsidered the variation of patterns of initial care  accounting for time required for adjuvant \ntherapy  This approach likely resulted in a more accurate identification for each patient of \nwhen initial treatment actually ended than if we had applied a fixed time for initial treatment \nto all patients  Our analysis included a large population-based cohort of Medicare enrollees \ndiagnosed with non-metastatic cancer who later died from cancer  Use of Medicare claims \nallowed for longitudinal tracking of recurrence indicators  Reporting of surgery  \nchemotherapy and RT from the Medicare and SEER data has been found to be \ncomplete 16–20 In addition  Medicare has a designated hospice benefit which allowed us to \nidentify accurately when patients initiated hospice care \n\nThere were also limitations with this study  The SEER-Medicare data do not report if and \nwhen a recurrence occurs  and as a result  we did not have a “gold standard”  such as a \nmedical record  to evaluate claims for identifying recurrence  Instead  we identified cohorts \nof patients who very likely experienced a recurrence - those with non-metastatic disease who \nreceived initial treatment  had a treatment-free interval and who died from their cancer  Our \napproach has face validity to capture a cohort of patients who had a recurrence  However  \nthis approach excluded patients with recurrence who did not die of cancer within the period \nof observation  Thus we were not able to assess the predictive value or specificity of the \nMedicare claims to identify recurrence  We attributed all hospice admissions to the patient \nhaving cancer  although some patients who died from their cancer may have had other \nconditions that resulted in the hospice admission  Some patients may have had evidence of \nrecurrence not captured in the Medicare claims  such as patients receiving care from other \ninsurers  e g  the Veteran’s Administration  In our analysis  we restricted the cohort to \npatients with a single cancer and any cancer death  relying on the death certificate for cause \nof death  There have been questions about the accuracy of cause of death on death \ncertificates for some conditions  However several studies that have focused exclusively on \ncancer have found high agreement between clinicians’ assessment of cause of death with \nwhat was reported from the death certificate  21–23 Finally  although the age distribution of \nthe Medicare patients who died from cancer was relatively similar to those with a \ncomparable clinical presentation who did not die from cancer  those who did not die from \ncancer may be more likely to have been treated or differed systematically from those who \ndied from their cancer  These findings may not be generalizable to younger populations who \nmay be more likely to receive cancer therapy following recurrence \n\nFindings from our analysis have practical implications for studies designed to use health \nclaims for studies of comparative effectiveness or cancer outcomes  With an increasing \n\nWarren et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01

expensive and \nchallenging to conduct  there is mounting interest in leveraging health claims to evaluate the \nreal world consequences of treatment interventions  For cancers with favorable prognosis  \noverall survival is an imperfect endpoint  Evaluation of disease-free and recurrence-free \nsurvival is of increasing importance  Unfortunately  our findings demonstrate that Medicare \nclaims are not a viable resource for estimating recurrence  Ideally  as software for electronic \nhealth records  EHR  is being refined  development of standardized approaches for defining \nand recording recurrence will be a priority for the oncology community  Such information \nwill enable improved cancer surveillance and better assessment of treatment effectiveness  \nUntil information from the EHR is available  use of Medicare data to assess recurrence will \nmiss many patients and those identified will not be representative of all patients with \nrecurrence \n\n Supplementary

survivors of Hodgkin Lymphoma  HL  are at an increased risk of developing a \ntreatment-related secondary malignancy  1  In particular  girls and young women under the \nage of 30 treated with chest radiotherapy have a significantly increased lifetime risk of \ndeveloping breast cancer compared to the general population  2–4  Based on this increased \nrisk  the American Cancer Society  the American College of Radiology  and the Society of \nBreast Imaging recommend annual screening breast magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  as \nan adjunct to annual screening mammography for these patients  5  6  These \nrecommendations  based on expert consensus opinion  have evolved from the experience of \nscreening breast MRI in women with a strong family history of breast cancer or those with a \nBRCA 1 or 2 mutation  7  8 \n\nFor survivors of HL  however  there are limited data and experience as to how to optimally \nincorporate breast MRI into their long-term follow up and health maintenance  Although \nbreast MRI has a high sensitivity for detecting breast cancer  it has a modest specificity \ncompared to mammography  9  Furthermore  overall costs raise important questions  \nincluding timing of initiation of screening MRI  frequency of its use  and whether there are \nclinical and/or HL treatment-related factors that might predict which patients would benefit \nmost from additional breast imaging \n\nThe goal of the current study is to evaluate breast imaging in a group of women previously \ntreated with chest irradiation for HL  In this report  we review and characterize the \nmammographic and breast MRI findings as well as breast biopsies in a cohort of women \npreviously irradiated for HL to determine features that may help guide the optimal use of \nscreening breast MRI in this patient population \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWith institutional review board approval  a retrospective review of all patients treated with \nchest irradiation for HL at Stanford University Medical Center was performed  Between \n1961 and 2008  980 females were identified  Only those patients who had breast imaging \nperformed at our institution  including mammography and/or breast MRI  were included  as \noutside breast imaging studies were not available for review  Records were reviewed to \ndetermine the age at radiotherapy treatment  radiotherapy dose received  mammographic and \nbreast MRI findings  breast biopsy results if applicable  and the incidence of breast \ncarcinomas detected \n\nHorst et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available

oblique \nimages  When abnormal findings were identified  diagnostic mammography was performed \nto include lateral medial images as well as spot or magnification views as indicated  Since \n2002  mammography was performed using a GE 2000D Senographe or Essential digital \nmammography unit  GE Milwaukee  Wisconsin  equipped with R2 Computer Assisted \nDetection  CAD  systems  Sunnyvale  CA  Since 2004  all diagnostic mammography was \nperformed using digital technology  All mammographic and MR images were reviewed by \ndedicated  fellowship trained breast diagnostic radiologists  Imaging characteristics were \nreported according to the ACR BI-RADS Reporting System  10  Patients with suspicious or \nindeterminate mammographic findings underwent focused ultrasound  US  and US-guided \nor stereotactic biopsy if indicated  Pathology was recorded and correlated retrospectively \nwith the mammographic findings \n\nBreast MR imaging was performed in a 1 5-T scanner  Echospeed  GE Medical Systems  \nMilwaukee  WI  All images were obtained in the prone position with a dedicated phased \narray breast coil  MRI Devices  Waukesha  WI  Whole breast rapid dynamic MR images \nand high-spatial-resolution fat-nulled MR images were contemporaneously acquired by \nusing a combination of dynamic 3-dimensional  3D  spiral MRI to obtain initial kinetic \nenhancement curves during the wash-in phase of gadolinium  GD  contrast by methods \npreviously described  11–13  Intravenous GD  Gadoteridol  Bracco Diagnostics  Princeton  \nNJ or Magnevist  Berlex  Berlin  Germany  at a dose of 0 1 mmol/kg was infused as a rapid \nbolus at a rate of 2 to 3 mL/s using a power injector  Spectris  Medrad  Immediately \nfollowing this injection  high-spatial-resolution transfer  3DSSMT  imaging was done to \ncollect information regarding morphology followed by additional dynamic 3D spiral MRI to \nobtain delayed kinetic enhancement curves  The raw data were then post processed on the \nGE Advantage Windows workstation  Advantage Windows  GE  Milwaukee  WI   12  13  \nThese curves were classified as highly suspicious  rapid initial uptake with washout or \nplateau  indeterminate suspicion  rapid initial uptake with sustained late phase  or low \nsuspicion  slow uptake with a persistent late phase   12  The MRI was timed in relation to \nthe menstrual cycle in cases where it was feasible with respect to the patient’s availability  \nregularity of her cycle  and if it did not significantly delay any workup and treatment of a \npreviously diagnosed cancer  Menstrual cycle information was recorded on a breast history \nform that was available for evaluation by the diagnostic radiologist at the time of \ninterpretation  Screening MRI studies  defined as MRI studies performed as a screening \ntechnique without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer  were obtained annually  alternating \nevery 6 months with screening mammography  Diagnostic MRI studies  defined as \npreoperative breast MRI studies performed for workup of a breast cancer that was diagnosed \nby another modality  were obtained after completion of diagnostic mammography and/or \nultrasound \n\nMR imaging characteristics reported included size and morphology of any mass  the location \nin the breast  the description of mass margins  and the dynamic enhancement patterns \naccording to the ACR BI-RADS MRI Reporting System  14  15  Patients with suspicious or \nindeterminate MRI findings concerning for cancer underwent second-look focused US  If \nthe finding was identified by US  a biopsy was performed under US guidance  If the finding \nwas not seen by US  an MRI-guided biopsy was performed by methods previously described \n\nHorst et al  Page 3\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript

retrospectively with \nthe abnormal MRI findings \n\nPathology records for the needle biopsies performed by mammographic  US  or MRI \nguidance were reviewed and categorized as benign or malignant  The number of cancers \ndiagnosed  the method of detection  and the pathologic features were recorded  Descriptive \nstatistics were used to assess the type of breast imaging these patients received  the number \nof biopsies prompted by each imaging technique  the results of the biopsies  the incidence of \nbreast cancer  and the age and time since HL treatment for those diagnosed with a breast \nmalignancy  Given that the relative risk of developing breast cancer is greatest in those \npatients who were treated with chest irradiation at the age of 30 years or younger  3  17–20  \nthe data were also analyzed separately for those treated for HL ≤ 30 years of age  Data were \nalso assessed according to the era in which the breast cancer was diagnosed  as breast MRI \nwas not routinely available in most academic centers until 1995 and the ACR guidelines for \nscreening breast MRI were not introduced until 2007  5 \n\nRESULTS\nBetween 1961 and 2008  980 female patients were treated

only began to utilize breast MRI in 1995  and that the \nACR guidelines for screening breast MRI were not introduced until 2007  the dates in which \npatients were diagnosed with breast cancer were reviewed  Table 6  Of the 35 cancers \ndiagnosed in 33 patients  1  3%  was diagnosed before 1995  This cancer was diagnosed by \nscreening mammography  with no screening MRI studies performed prior to 1995  Between \n1995 and 2007  62 screening mammograms and 8 screening breast MRI studies were \nperformed  Twenty-one cancers  60%  were diagnosed during this time  with 6 diagnosed by \npalpation  14 by screening mammography  and 1 by PET for evaluation of pleural effusion  \nAfter 2007  33 screening mammograms and 24 screening breast MRI studies were \nperformed in this cohort  Thirteen cancers  37%  were diagnosed after 2007  with 2 by \npalpation  10 by screening mammography  and 1 by prophylactic mastectomy \n\nDISCUSSION\nIt is well documented that young women treated with chest irradiation for HL have an \nincreased risk of breast cancer  particularly those treated before the age of 30 years  2  21  \nSince this risk appears to increase as early as 8 years after radiotherapy treatment  experts \nhave recommended that these women initiate screening mammography at age 25 or 8 years \nafter treatment  2  3  22  23  Many women in this risk category  however  are unaware of \ntheir increased risk and do not undergo regular screening mammography  24  25  Even with \nthe earlier initiation of screening mammography  many breast cancers are still detected by \npalpable findings on clinical examination  26 \n\nMore recently  screening breast MRI has been recommended for this patient population as \nan adjunct to mammography based on the observed risk  5–6  While breast MRI has a high \nsensitivity for detecting breast cancer  particularly for those with increased breast density  its \nroutine use has been controversial given the modest specificity that may result in false \npositive findings and benign biopsies  27  28  Since the establishment of these guidelines in \n2007  there have been limited data regarding patient compliance  biopsy rates  and cancer \ndetection rates in survivors of HL  The current study was designed to evaluate breast \nimaging practice patterns in this patient population at our institution leading up to the ACR \nguidelines for screening breast MRI \n\nWe found that despite the introduction of breast MRI in 1995  only 21% of the patients in \nour cohort underwent screening breast MRI  with 5% undergoing screening breast MRI only \nafter having been diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer  An additional 12% \nunderwent preoperative MRI for workup of a breast cancer that had been established by \nanother modality  while the remaining 67% underwent mammography only  These data \nsuggest slow adoption of breast MRI in this cohort compared to its use in other high-risk \npatient groups  7 \n\nYet with the establishment of the ACR guidelines in 2007  there has been increased \nawareness of the potential benefit of screening breast MRI in addition to screening \nmammography  In a cohort of 91 women with a history of chest irradiation  Sung et al  at \nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 4 mammographically occult cancers \n\nHorst et al  Page 6\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 April 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nwith the use of screening breast MRI  29  These findings are similar to Freitas et al  at the \nUniversity of Toronto  where 4 breast cancers in a cohort of 98 women previously treated \nwith chest radiotherapy were diagnosed by screening MRI only  30 \n\nInterestingly  11 of the 35 cancers detected in our series  31%  were DCIS  which appeared \nas calcifications on mammography  This is similar to Sung et al  where 3 of 10 cancers \n 30%  identified were in situ carcinomas detected on screening mammography only  29  \nThe results of both series support the recommendation that MR imaging should be used as \nan adjunct to  and not in place of  mammography in this patient population \n\nOur study is limited by its retrospective nature from a single institution and its small sample \nsize with a limited number of breast MRI studies  It also is limited by potential selection \nbias  as we did not have complete information about the other female HL survivors who did \nnot have breast imaging performed at our institution to verify that the study population is not \na biased population  In addition  we did not have breast imaging studies that may have been \nperformed at outside institutions  Our results  however  provide preliminary information for \nthe design of future studies \n\nAn ongoing study by Ng et al at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Dana-Farber \nCancer Center is prospectively evaluating the role of screening breast MRI in women \npreviously treated with mantle irradiation for HL at age ≤ 35 and more than 8 years beyond \ntreatment  31  Preliminary results of 148 women demonstrated that while the addition of \nscreening breast MRI contributed to the detection of an additional 5 cancers that would have \notherwise been missed by mammography  it also resulted in 18 unnecessary biopsies in 14 \nwomen  Similar to our series  Ng et al reported one cancer  DCIS  that was identified on \nprophylactic mastectomy but was missed by imaging  further highlighting the need for even \nmore improvements in breast imaging \n\nFinally  when evaluating the use of breast MRI in this population  a main limitation is the \nera in which patients are evaluated and the time delay between introduction of an imaging \nmodality and its adoption into clinical practice  As our cohort only included imaging studies \nup until 2008  we were not able to evaluate the impact of the 2007 guidelines on the use of \nbreast MRI  Future studies will explore breast MRI after 2008 and its effect on breast cancer \ndetection \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe role of screening breast MRI in women previously irradiated for Hodgkin Lymphoma is \nevolving  Further education of patients and physicians is important to increase awareness of \nmore sensitive breast cancer screening modalities in this high-risk population  Additional \nstudies are warranted to determine the optimal timing and frequency of screening breast \nMRI with the goal of earlier detection and improved breast cancer outcomes in these \nwomen \n\nHorst et al  Page 7\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 April 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor

oncologic and aesthetic outcomes  1–4  The existing medical \nliterature on this topic consists predominantly of surgical reports from university hospitals  \nMoreover  outcomes data are sparse in regard to combination treatment with OBS followed \nby postoperative radiation therapy  RT   5 6 \n\nCosmesis is a critical endpoint for breast conservation  There is strong evidence that after \nstandard lumpectomy followed by postoperative RT  cosmesis suffers with increasing breast \ntissue resection volumes  7–9  Since OBS techniques generally result in larger resection \nvolumes and increased surgical manipulation of breast tissue than lumpectomy  there is \nsignificant potential for worse aesthetic outcomes when OBS is followed by standard \npostoperative RT to the whole breast  10–12  In that regard  herein we present early \noutcomes  including patient reported cosmesis and satisfaction with OBS and RT at a large \ncommunity hospital \n\nMETHODS\nPatients with localized breast cancer who underwent OBS followed by standard RT at \nCoastal Carolina Radiation Oncology  CCRO  between July  2006 and February  2012 were \nreviewed  The protocol for gathering and reporting this data was reviewed and approved by \nthe Institutional Review Board of New Hanover Regional Medical Center  In 2011  the \nauthors initiated a prospective phase II clinical trial of hypofractionated RT after OBS and \nthese patients are excluded from the current analysis \n\nSurgery was performed as a single procedure in all cases  All patients had intraoperative \nevaluation of surgical margins by frozen section and  if initially positive  underwent \nimmediate re-excision  all with ultimately negative surgical margins  Patients underwent \npartial mastectomy with immediate ipsilateral reconstruction and contralateral \nmammoreduction  Reconstruction was achieved utilizing the Modified Wise pattern inferior \npedicle mastopexy in most cases  For patients with tumors in the 5 00 to 7 00 axis  a \nsuperior pedicle  superomedial pedicle  or free nipple graft were performed  Surgical \nmanagement of the axilla was dependent upon disease extent  During this time frame  \npatients found to have a positive sentinel node routinely underwent completion axillary \nnodal dissection \n\nThe time interval between surgery and the initiation of RT was recorded  Postoperative RT \nwas delivered utilizing standard fractionation of 1 8–2 0 Gy daily to the whole breast with \nno boost  since no tumor bed was discernible to target  The treating radiation oncologist’s \nevaluation of cosmesis was recorded at one to three months post-RT as  excellent  good  fair  \nor poor for each patient  No attempt was made to control for differences in perception of \ncosmesis among the treating physicians \n\nBeginning in November 2009  patients who had undergone OBS and were seen in \nconsultation at CCRO for consideration of postoperative RT were offered participation in a \nprospective quality of life analysis  These 44 patients agreed to complete the Radiation \nTherapy Oncology Group  RTOG  Quality of Life Baseline  QLB  questionnaire pre-RT  \npost-RT  and 6-months after RT assessing their cosmesis and satisfaction with treatment  \n\nMaguire et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nFinal follow-up to assess patient reported cosmesis and treatment satisfaction was via \npersonal phone call from the lead author  The QLB questionnaire was the same instrument \nutilized for the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  NSABP  B39 trial  It \nincluded specific questions regarding breast size  shape  appearance and pain  as well as arm \npain and stiffness  However  for the purposes of the current analysis  patient reported \noutcomes were limited to overall cosmesis and treatment satisfaction  Possible choices for \npatients’ assessment of cosmesis were the same as those for physicians  excellent  good  fair  \nor poor  Patients were also provided choices within the QLB survey to describe their overall \ntreatment satisfaction pre-RT  post-RT  at 6 months  and at the final follow-up as  totally \nsatisfied  somewhat satisfied  neutral  somewhat dissatisfied  or unsatisfied  The first two \nchoices for this survey question were considered favorable \n\nDescriptive statistics were reported as frequencies  medians and ranges  A logistic regression \nanalysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of patient  tumor  and treatment \nfactors on the development of toxicity and ordinal logistic regressions assessed the \nrelationships between survey ratings and demographic/treatment variables  Comparisons of \nratings between pre-RT  post-RT  6MO  and final surveys were tested by using an \nANCOVA on the ranks  adjusting for the individual patient  Tests were run using SAS 9 0 \n SAS Institute  Cary NC  All tests were two tailed and a level of significance  α = 0 05 was \nused \n\nRESULTS\nDuring 2008–2011  79 patients were included in the study  Patients were predominantly \nCaucasian  85%  Table 1  with a median age of 61 9 years  The vast majority  91%  had \nAmerican Joint Commission on Cancer stage 0 – II disease \n\nAxillary surgery consisted of sentinel lymph node biopsy only in the majority of patients \n Table 2  Thirty patients  38%  received chemotherapy sequentially with RT  8  27%  of \nwhom received it neoadjuvantly  The median time interval between OBS and initiation of \nRT was 9 6 weeks  though this interval ranged from 3 to 35 weeks since 22 patients received \nchemotherapy adjuvantly  between surgery and RT  The median RT dose was 46 Gy \n\nFourteen patients  18%  developed surgical toxicities prior to the initiation of RT  Table 3  \nAmong 22 patients who underwent standard axillary lymph node dissection  4  18%  \ndeveloped symptomatic arm lymphedema  Other common surgical toxicities were mastitis \nand delayed wound healing  Five patients  6%  developed acute RT toxicities  all of which \nwere skin-related  The treating radiation oncologist rated patient cosmesis at 1–3 months \npost-RT as 3% excellent  94% good  and 4% fair  No significant relationship was found \nbetween toxicity and the treatment related variables of chemotherapy or radiation dose \n Table 4  At a median follow-up of 2 9 years  no patient had developed local or regional \nrecurrence \n\nBeginning in November 2009  forty-four patients received the RTOG QLB questionnaires \nfor prospective evaluation of their cosmesis and treatment satisfaction  Among this group  \n14 patients were excluded from the analysis for either not having completed a pre-treatment \n\nMaguire et al  Page 3\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor

22 subjects completed all baseline and follow-up \nquestionnaires for a complete response rate of 50%  However  those patients who had \ncompleted the pre-treatment survey and at least one follow-up survey were included  for an \noverall response rate of 68%  Figure 1 \n\nCosmesis was rated as excellent or good by 87% of patients pre-RT  82% post-RT  75% at 6 \nmonths  and 88% at the final follow-up  Patient ratings at pre-RT  post-RT  6 months  and at \nfinal follow-up were not significantly different from each other  nor did ratings significantly \nincrease or decrease over time  p = 0 7795  Table 5  An ordinal logistic regression of the \ncosmesis rating showed that age  whether chemotherapy was received  RT dose  time to RT  \nor follow-up time had no significant effect on pre-RT  post-RT  6 month  or final follow-up \nscores \n\nTreatment satisfaction was rated as “total” or “somewhat” by 97% of patients pre-RT  93% \npost-RT  75% at 6 months  and 96% at final follow-up  p = 0 1638  As with cosmesis  \nratings at each follow-up interval did not significantly differ from each other  There was a \nsimilar trend revealing lower treatment satisfaction at 6 months which improved at final \nfollow-up  The ordinal regression analysis showed no relationship between demographic or \ntreatment variables and treatment satisfaction  Though we tried to include race as a factor  \nthe inclusion of this variable in the regression analysis resulted in quasi-separation of data \ndue to small numbers  12 African American patients  which required this variable to be \nremoved from the model \n\nDISCUSSION\nThis report describes reasonable early results with breast conservation utilizing oncoplastic \nbreast surgery  OBS  followed by postoperative radiation therapy  RT  to the whole breast  \nReports from major university hospitals reveal favorable evaluations of cosmesis by the \ntreating surgeons  13–16  The current report reveals similar favorable  albeit early  \nevaluations by radiation oncologists  However  since evaluations were made by the treating \nphysician  bias is a factor  More importantly  patients’ prospective evaluation of early \ncosmesis and overall satisfaction with OBS followed by RT was relatively high  These \nresults are comparable to patients’ assessments of their aesthetic outcomes in reported \nsurgical series  17 18  There was a decrement in cosmesis as evaluated by patients at six \nmonths after completing surgery and RT  This difference was not statistically significant  an \nunsurprising result given the relatively small size of the group in this report  Unfortunately  \na control group of patients treated with OBS alone  no adjuvant RT  is lacking  Thus  it \nremains unknown whether the trend of decline in QOL scores at six months after completion \nof postoperative RT may be clinically significant  Potential reasons for this decline in \npatients’ perceived cosmesis at 6 months after treatment include RT fibrosis  progressive \nsurgical scarring  or merely patients’ evolving opinions of their cosmesis over time  The \nupward trend in patient reported cosmesis and treatment satisfaction between the 6 month \nmark and final follow-up is encouraging  However  since the final follow-up for these two \npatient reported outcomes was via phone call from the lead author  patients may have \nreported answers which they thought would be more pleasing to the physician \n\nMaguire et al  Page 4\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIn regard to long-term oncologic outcomes  the relatively short follow-up in the current \nreport limits meaningful commentary for this group of patients with early stage breast \ncancer  The surgical literature supports an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate ranging \nfrom 0–2% annually for patients with early stage disease treated with OBS  19–21  Details \nare lacking about delivery of postoperative RT in most OBS reports  making the current \nreport quite valuable  Because post-lumpectomy RT has been proven to improve not only \nlocal control but also survival  it remains a standard component of breast conservation \ntherapy  22  The potential to achieve more “widely negative” surgical margins with OBS \nmay tempt some surgeons to forego patient referral to radiation oncology  Unfortunately  \nthere is no data to substantiate the seemingly intuitive assumption that wider margins result \nin improved local tumor control or survival  Which subset of patients treated with \noncoplastic techniques for their breast conserving surgery  if any  does not require \npostoperative RT in order to minimize cancer recurrence risk  This question remains to be \nanswered  ideally via a clinical trial \n\nShorter RT fractionation schemes have proven to be safe and effective in randomized trials \nfor patients with early stage breast cancer treated with standard lumpectomy  23 24  \nHowever  theoretical concerns arise with respect to fibrosis when higher daily doses of RT \nare delivered after large volume breast resections  and in patients undergoing OBS  the \nsurgery is more extensive than that of a standard lumpectomy  Our group has initiated a \nphase II clinical trial evaluating cosmesis with hypofractionated RT after OBS to evaluate \nthis question  Accrual has been brisk and trial closure is anticipated in late 2013 \n\nThere are other limitations to the current study  The retrospective nature of the analysis on \nthe entire patient cohort  N=79  may have resulted in selection bias  The authors have \nattempted to account for this potential bias by including all patients who underwent OBS  \nwere referred for radiation oncology consultation  and underwent postoperative RT at \nCCRO  The quality of any retrospective case series is also dependent upon the accuracy and \ncompleteness of the medical record  No attempt was made to account for differences in \nperceived cosmesis among the treating radiation oncologists  The prospective subgroup \nassessment of cosmesis and overall treatment satisfaction is limited by small numbers and \nmoderate questionnaire response rate  Multivariate analysis of the potential impact of patient \nand treatment factors on toxicity revealed no clear correlation  though this type of analysis is \nalso hampered by small sample size  With a larger prospective patient cohort  as in our \nongoing clinical trial  comparisons over time  between baseline and post-treatment  may be \nmore meaningful \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOncoplastic breast surgery followed by standard whole breast RT yielded an acceptable \ntoxicity profile and favorable physician-rated cosmesis in this large community series  \nPatients’ ratings of cosmesis and treatment satisfaction were relatively high overall  with an \napparent nadir at 6 months after surgery and adjuvant RT  Late cosmesis  as well as long-\nterm oncologic outcomes  will be evaluated for a similar group of patients treated on our \nprospective phase II trial of oncoplastic breast surgery followed by hypofractionated RT \n\nMaguire et al  Page 5\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor

attracted increasing attention as an important topic \nin health research since passage of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 [16  7]  Increased \nfocus on the participation of ethnic minority populations emerged with Healthy People 2010  \nwhich established the inclusion of ethnic minorities in health research as an overarching goal \nthat is essential for ensuring the elimination of health disparities [22]  However  despite \nsignificant efforts  ethnic minorities are frequently underrepresented  and disparities in early \ndetection  treatment  mortality  and survivorship related to ethnicity still exist [25] \n\nMore specifically  the participation of ethnic minorities such as Asian-Americans in cancer \nsurvivorship studies has persistently lagged behind that of Whites [11  20]  Significant gaps \nexist in terms of health-related quality of life  HRQOL  and coping for ethnic minority \ncancer survivors and their family members  For example  Asian American subgroups have \nbeen combined under the umbrella category of ‘Asian Americans ’ or excluded from \nresearch or placed in the ‘other’ category  Fewer studies also showed inconsistent findings \nin terms of HRQOL experiences of Asian-American subgroups due to small sample sizes of \nethnic subgroups [3  13]  Furthermore  given that cultures might affect the coping and \ncommunication process between cancer survivors and their families [14]  investigations \nwhich employ convenient samples with primarily white survivors may limit the \ngeneralizability of findings in coping and communication studies  Thus  recruiting more \nAsian-American populations into cancer survivorship studies is critical to allow for better \ninterpretability of the findings \n\nRobinson and Trochim [19] noted the paucity of detailed information on the causes of the \nlow participation rates of ethnic minority populations  Nevertheless  several studies have \ndescribed a variety of factors that potentially affect recruitment among ethnic minority \ncancer patients  For example  language barriers  lower socio-economic status  SES  lack of \nhealth insurance and care  unstable employment status  and cultural factors impede the \nparticipation of Asian-Americans in cancer research [26  10  4]  Because of these \nchallenges  researchers often perceive that Asian-Americans are less willing to participate in \nresearch or that Asian-American groups are difficult to reach [4] \n\nTo date  a variety of strategies specific for recruiting ethnic minorities have been tried  For \nexample  Dignan and colleagues [5] developed the clinic-based recruitment plan \ncollaboratively to work with the research team and the clinic staff  and provided incentive \npayments considering gas prices  Friedman and colleagues [6] suggested flexibility with \nscheduling  and engagement with community advisors using formalized process  Another \nstudy emphasized the development of a community-based culturally and linguistically \nappropriate educational intervention to increase health literacy in cancer communication \n[15]  Despite the gain in knowledge in this area  the lack of sufficient representation of \nAsian-Americans remains a challenge to improving cancer research and ultimately \neliminating ethnic disparities in health outcomes \n\nIn this paper  we utilize data from an outcome study that actively recruited Asian-American \ncancer survivors to describe ethnic minority recruitment experiences  Although this study \n\nLim and Paek Page 2\n\nJ Cancer Educ  Author manuscript  available in

various \nstrategies  e g  the use of cancer registries  community outreach  trusted community \nmembers  contacts with participants from previous studies  and snowball sampling  were \nadopted to enroll and gain consent from participants  Based on our experiences  we discuss \nchallenges to the successful recruitment of Asian-American patients in cancer survivorship \nresearch and provide recommendations for future recruitment efforts \n\nMETHODS\nThe original study intended to investigate the role of family communication in coping and \nquality of life for Chinese- and Korean-American breast cancer survivors  BCS  The study \nemployed a culturally responsive model [2] for ethnic minority inclusion in survivorship \nresearch to maximize Asian-American recruitment  The study was approved by the \ninstitutional review board at the study sites \n\nParticipants\nStudy participants included 157 Chinese-  n=86  and Korean-American  n=71  BCS living \nin LA  Eligibility criteria for inclusion were as follows   1  self-identifying as Chinese or \nKorean   2  being within 1–5 years of a breast cancer diagnosis  stage I –III   3  having \ncompleted active treatment   4  being 18 years old or older  and  5  being able to speak \nChinese  Korean  or English  Survivors of a more advanced stage of cancer  i e  stage IV  \nthose with other cancer diagnoses  and those with other major medical  e g  heart disease  \nstroke  and psychiatric  e g  major depression  schizophrenia  conditions were excluded \nbecause their medical characteristics  e g  disease progression and prognosis  were \nsignificantly different from their study counterparts \n\nRecruitment\nPrior to the recruitment of participants  all materials  i e  flyers  questionnaires  were \nprovided in both English and Chinese/Korean  because most Chinese- and Korean-\nAmericans have limited English proficiency  Using a rigorous “forward-backward” \ntranslation procedure  the English versions of the materials were translated and back-\ntranslated into Chinese and Korean by independent bilingual translators  The panel of \ntranslators then compared the two English versions to ensure that they were equivalent  \nCorrections were made until equivalence was achieved \n\nParticipants were recruited mainly from the California Cancer Surveillance program  CSP  \nspecifically  the LA  Desert Sierra  and Orange sites  and from local LA hospital cancer \nregistries from October 2009 to April 2011  As the largest county in California  LA County \nis a diverse urban and suburban area with a population exceeding 12 million  The 2010 \ncensus documented that LA County consisted of approximately 15% Asian-Americans  Of \nall Asian Americans living in LA County  Chinese-Americans comprised 27% and Korean-\nAmericans comprised 16%  indicating greater percentages compared to those in other areas \n[21] \n\nAccording to the CSP-designated procedures  a letter to each patient’s physician was first \nsent to notify the doctor of the study and invite his/her patients to participate  Invitation \n\nLim and Paek Page 3\n\nJ Cancer Educ  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nletters were then sent to each potential participant identified by the CSP if her physician did \nnot respond within two weeks indicating that she should not be contacted for health/medical \nreasons  This mailing also included a patient response form to allow the patient to express \ninterest in participating in the study or to request more information  If the patient response \nform was returned indicating interest  the potential participant received a screening \ntelephone call  If the patient response form was not received within two weeks of mailing  \nthe potential participant received telephone calls from a trained ethnically and linguistically \nmatched research assistant  RA  During this conversation  the RA indicated that an \ninvitation letter had been mailed  the study was described  any questions regarding the study \nwere answered  and the informed consent form was mentioned  If the potential participant \nwas interested  then the RA conducted a screening over the phone to assess eligibility  \nOtherwise  reasons why they do not want to participate were asked simply  Eligible \nparticipants were mailed a questionnaire and consent form and were asked to return them in \nan enclosed prepaid envelope within 3 weeks  If survivors had not returned the survey after \nthe third follow-up phone call  they were considered non-respondents \n\nAdditionally  community-based recruitment approaches were employed to identify more \nChinese- and Korean-American BCS  For Chinese-Americans  participants were recruited \nthrough community organizations and support groups where the principal investigator  PI  \nhas well-developed  strong  and mutual trusting relationships  Korean-American participants \nwere drawn from local LA hospitals  Korean doctors’ offices  support groups  and \ncommunity organizations  The PI has previously collaborated with physicians  nurses  and \nstaff in these agencies and they agreed to serve on a community advisory board as well as \nassist in recruiting Chinese- and Korean-Americans  Recruitment letters indicating study \npurpose  eligibility criteria  procedures  and contact information were mailed directly to \npotential participants by the agency staff to comply with patient privacy and HIPAA \nregulations  Flyers describing the study were also distributed to agencies  Collaborators in \nthe community agencies were involved in recruitment  the development of culturally and \nlinguistically appropriate materials  and the interpretation and dissemination of the findings \n\nRecruitment through newspapers and word of mouth  snowball sampling  was also \nemployed  We identified a variety of events in the Chinese- and Korean-American \ncommunities and sought permission from the organizers to attend and speak briefly about \nour study  We distributed flyers at the events describing the study to potential participants  \nWomen who did not immediately decide to participate received a follow-up telephone call if \nthey provided their contact information \n\nFinally  we directly contacted BCS from our previous studies who indicated an interest in \nparticipating in future research studies  They were recruited mainly through a local hospital \nregistry  community organizations  and support groups \n\nAll study procedures were conducted in the participants’ preferred language  e g  English  \nChinese  or Korean  by ethnically and linguistically matched RAs  Korean and Chinese  \nParticipants received an incentive payment of $40 for completing the survey \n\nLim and Paek Page 4\n\nJ Cancer Educ  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor

\nnumber of participants  Next  we determined the number of individuals who were accessible \n i e  those who were directly contacted by RA  and not accessible and the proportions of \nindividuals who refused to participate  who were ineligible to participate  who agreed to \nparticipate but did not complete the survey  called ‘passive refusal’  and who participated  \nWe then compared the

evolve  common clinical indications for \nconventional contrast-enhanced breast MRI currently include supplemental screening for \nhigh-risk women  pre-operative evaluation of breast cancer extent of disease  assessment of \nequivocal findings on standard imaging and/or clinical exam  and evaluation of breast cancer \nresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy \n\nPerhaps the greatest driving force behind the increasingly wide adoption of breast MRI at \nmany centers is its exquisite sensitivity  reported to approach 100%  for breast cancer \ndetection  Multiple studies have shown that conventional contrast-enhanced breast MRI has \nthe highest sensitivity of any imaging modality for breast cancer detection in asymptomatic \nhigh-risk women  5–8  and mammographically and clinically occult additional disease in the \ncontralateral  6  and ipsilateral breast  9  in patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer  \nHowever  a major barrier to wider adoption of this technique for average and intermediate \nrisk patients is its modest specificity due to overlap in the imaging features of benign and \nmalignant lesions  with wide variations in the positive predictive value  PPV  of breast MRI \nreported in the literature  24 to 89%   10 \n\nMRI also has been increasingly been studied as a tool to determine which newly diagnosed \nbreast cancers are likely to respond to pre-surgical  or neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  Several \nearly studies examining the use of MRI to assess early response to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy found that changes in size or volume and enhancement kinetic profiles on \nMRI were associated with favorable responses to therapy  including pathologic complete \nresponse  pCR   11  12  These findings suggested that MRI could be used to optimize \nmedical therapy regimens for each individual  The general superiority of MRI over clinical \nexamination and standard imaging techniques for predicting pCR was suggested in multiple \nsingle center studies  13  14  and confirmed in a large multi-center trial  15  Though \nstandard contrast-enhanced MRI is the most accurate modality for predicting important \nneoadjuvant therapy outcomes  its clinical impact has been limited by its cost and modest \noverall performance in this setting \n\nAlthough MRI is commonly used at many centers to further evaluate equivocally suspicious \nclinical or imaging findings  several obstacles have limited application of MRI in this \nclinical setting  Barriers to cost-effective implementation of MRI to reduce unnecessary \nbiopsies prompted by conventional imaging or clinical exam include the relatively low cost \nassociated with image-guided biopsies  which are highly accurate and safe  compared with \nserial imaging  16  and the high negative predictive value  NPV   ~98%  needed to obviate \nthe biopsy of a suspicious finding based on current American College of Radiology  ACR  \nBreast Imaging Reporting and Data System  BI-RADS  guidelines  17  Early studies have \ndemonstrated that the NPV of MRI for this clinical indication ranges from 76% for further \nevaluation of suspicious mammographic calcifications  18  to 85% in the setting of any \nsuspicious mammographic or clinical finding  19  Studies from our institution found that \nwhile breast MRI has high sensitivity and high NPV for this clinical indication  the added \nbreast cancer yield was too low to routinely recommend breast MRI for problem solving \n 20  More recently  Strobel et al found that suspicious  BI-RADS category 4  findings \nidentified on screening mammography or ultrasound that were further evaluated using \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 2\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 February 01 \n\nAuthor

sonographic findings and mammographic findings that did not \ninclude lesions comprised entirely of calcifications  21 \n\nThe basis for the strong clinical performance of conventional breast MRI has been through \nutilization of an imaging approach that emphasizes anatomic and morphologic detail through \nhigh spatial resolution and limited temporal resolution dynamic contrast enhanced  DCE-\nMRI  technique  This approach provides limited insight on physiologic features of breast \ntissue and pathology through the measurement of semi-quantitative kinetic features  While \nthese basic kinetic enhancement features  including peak initial phase and delayed phase \ncurve descriptors  have shown some ability to distinguish between malignant and benign \nlesions  22  they in general have provided a small incremental value to standard \nmorphological descriptions  19  As a result  there is increasing interest in exploring whether \nmultiparametric approaches to breast MRI that incorporate more highly quantitative \npharmacokinetic DCE-MRI modeling and other functional MRI techniques  such as \ndiffusion weighted imaging  DWI  and magnetic resonance spectroscopy  MRS  to probe \nspecific biological properties such as abnormal vessel permeability  cellularity  and chemical \ncomposition  can further advance the use of MRI for these specific clinical settings \n\nBreast MRI Parameters\nThere is no single way to achieve high quality breast MRI  and this is particularly true when \nconsidering a multiparametric approach to MRI acquisition  Nonetheless  MRI should \ninclude an acquisition utilizing a high field  B0  magnet  ≥1 5T  that is bilateral with \ncomplete breast and axilla coverage  Only dedicated breast surface coils are appropriate for \nbreast MRI applications  as the built-in body coil cannot provide enough signal-to-noise \n SNR  for high quality breast imaging \n\nDynamic Contrast Enhanced  DCE  MRI\nCurrently  a DCE-MRI acquisition is central to breast MRI protocols  and the ACR Breast \nMRI Accreditation Program  BMRAP  mandates that a multiphase T1-weighted acquisition \nbe performed for clinical breast MRI  Due to time and technical restraints  DCE-MRI \nprotocols generally emphasize either high spatial resolution and full coverage or high \ntemporal resolution in imaging of contrast uptake kinetics in breast  However  more \nsophisticated acquisition strategies that “under-sample” the periphery of k space on \nsubsequent dynamic acquisitions and more frequently sample the center of k space can \nprovide simultaneous high spatial  high temporal resolution acquisitions with full bilateral \ncoverage  23–25   Fig  1  There is wide variation among centers on the number of post-\ncontrast phases acquired  The ACR BMRAP requires acquisition of a minimum of two post \ncontrast T1 weighted images  with the first post-contrast sequence acquired within 4 minutes \nof contrast injection  DCE-MRI acquisition provides two primary imaging features that can \nbe used to evaluate breast lesions  morphology and kinetic enhancement characteristics \n\nMorphology—There are three general morphologic descriptors of enhancing findings of \nthe breast  which are defined by the ACR BI-RADS atlas  foci  masses  and non-mass \nenhancement  NME  Masses and NMEs also have additional descriptors that can further

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nrefine an interpreting radiologist’s suspicion for malignancy  Prior studies have shown that \nmorphologic features are perhaps the most important factor for initial assessment of \nlikelihood of malignancy of a given lesion  19  Suspicious morphologic features for masses \ninclude irregular shape  heterogeneous or rim internal enhancement  and irregular or \nspiculated margins  Suspicious NME morphologic features include segmental or linear \ndistribution with heterogeneous or clustered ring enhancement  Breast cancers that present \nas NME are more likely to reflect in situ carcinoma than masses  however  significant \noverlap exists in morphologic presentation on MRI of invasive breast cancer  ductal \ncarcinoma in situ  and atypical/high-risk lesions \n\nDCE kinetic enhancement features—Differential enhancement of malignancies \nrelative to normal breast tissue is based on the fact that malignancies typically recruit \nabnormal new blood vessels to support their growth  i e  angiogenesis  The rate at which \nthese abnormal vessels allow nutrients to spill into a tumor and the rate cell cycle byproducts \nare removed from a tumor can be characterized through assessing kinetic enhancement \ncurves obtained from DCE-MRI  Most commonly  breast kinetic enhancement features are \nmeasured semi-quantitatively using modest temporal resolution with at least two to three \npost-contrast T1-weighted acquisitions  with k-space centered at approximately 90 to 120 \nseconds after contrast injection for the first post-contrast images  Using the data obtained at \neach of these time points  a time-signal intensity curve can be determined for a given lesion \nor region of interest  ROI  allowing assessment of two phases of enhancement  initial \nphase  within approximately two minutes of contrast injection  and late  or delayed  phase  \nafter two minutes or after peak enhancement  Fig  2  In the initial phase  enhancement \nclassifications of “slow”  “medium”  and “fast” are determined by signal intensity increase \ndefined by the equation \n\nwhere SIpre is the baseline signal intensity of a region of interest and SIpost is the signal \nintensity of the same region of interest after contrast injection  In the delayed phase  \nenhancement curves can be classified by three basic curve types  persistent  plateau  and \nwashout  Persistent delayed enhancement is generally considered to be a benign \nenhancement curve type  while plateau delayed enhancement is of intermediate suspicion for \nmalignancy and washout delayed enhancement is the most suggestive of malignancy  \nAlthough the most classic combined curve type for malignant breast lesions is fast initial \nenhancement followed by early washout  sometimes referred to as a type III curve  26  \nthere is significant overlap of semi-quantitative kinetic curve types among benign and \nmalignant lesions \n\nMRI techniques that acquire post contrast images with high temporal resolution can allow \nfor more elegant assessment of contrast kinetics through pharmacokinetic modeling \ntechniques  Pharmacokinetic models enable quantitative assessments of contrast agent \nexchange between the intravascular and the interstitial space  providing measures related to \ntumor blood flow  microvasculature  and capillary permeability  A two-compartment model \nis the most commonly used approach  measuring the exchange of contrast between tissue  in \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 4\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am

and was first proposed in an MRI-context by \nTofts and Kermode  27  The concentrations of the gadolinium tracer for each compartment \nvary with time after the bolus injection of the contrast agent  and quantitative metrics can be \nmeasured by this model using the following relationship\n\nwhere the volume transfer constant Ktrans reflects the rate of transfer of gadolinium from \nplasma to the tissue  units  min−1   Fig  1D  the transfer rate constant kep  min−1  reflects \nthe reflux of contrast agent from the extravascular extracellular space to the plasma \ncompartment  and ve  %  reflects the leakage of fractional volume from the extravascular \nextracellular space into the plasma compartment \n\nPromising clinical applications of quantitative DCE MRI—Multiple authors have \ndemonstrated that some of these pharmacokinetic parameters  particularly Ktrans and kep  \nhold value for improved discrimination of malignant from benign breast pathologies  and \nmay even be used as biomarkers of disease subtypes  Li and colleagues demonstrated that \nKtrans and kep values progressively increased when measuring normal glands  benign \nlesions  and malignant lesions  respectively  noting that invasive ductal carcinomas and \nductal carcinoma in situ lesions exhibited significantly higher Ktrans and kep values than \nductal dysplasias  28  Huang et al demonstrated that using Ktrans values of lesions found to \nbe suspicious on standard clinical breast MRI  a potential “cutoff” value could be used such \nthat lesions with lower Ktrans values could avoid biopsy and thereby decrease false positive \nMR examinations  29  Finally  DCE-MRI holds potential for assessing alterations in tumor \nperfusion in response to preoperative therapies  Fig 3  Ktrans values have been shown in a \nrecent meta-analysis to be among the most promising MRI parameters for prediction of near \npathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  outperforming standard tumor \nsize measurements  30 \n\nTechnical challenges and considerations of quantitative DCE-MRI—In order to \nperform DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic modeling and calculate quantitative parameters  \nknowledge of both the pre-contrast T1 relaxation times of the tumor or tissue being imaged \nand the arterial input function  AIF  or the concentration of contrast agent as it changes \nover time within the arterial blood  is required  Measuring each of these parameters \nintroduces unique challenges and potential for error  Pre-contrast T1 mapping is an essential \nstep to convert DCE-MRI signal intensity into contrast agent concentration  T1 mapping \nrequires acquisition of an additional series of images prior to DCE MRI  most commonly \nusing varying flip angle or inversion recovery approaches  and thus adds to the overall \nexamination times  Moreover  variable flip angle approaches are prone to inaccuracies due \nto B1 inhomogeneity  a common issue for breast imaging  particularly at higher field \nstrengths  31  Most models require that the AIF be measured directly for each subject  32  \nwhich is often challenging to perform and necessitates acquisition tradeoffs  in coverage \nand/or spatial resolution  to achieve the very high temporal resolution required to accurately \nsample the rapidly changing AIF  Furthermore  AIF measures can be very sensitive to

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\npatient motion between dynamic acquisitions  One common approach to avoid the challenge \nof directly calculating the AIF is to employ an average AIF calculated from a larger \npopulation for whom the injection site  dose  and rate were kept constant  29  Yankeelov et \nal have proposed another method to circumvent this problem by estimating the AIF using a \nreference region model  and found that such an approach correlated well with direct AIF \nmeasurement  33  Novel high spatiotemporal DCE-MRI acquisition strategies  as described \nearlier  hold potential to provide high temporal resolution sampling of contrast enhancement \ncurves without undesirable tradeoffs in spatial resolution and coverage  which may improve \nfeasibility for utilization of pharmacokinetic analysis in clinical breast applications  25 \n\nTheoretically  model-based pharmacokinetic parameters have the advantage over semi-\nquantitative enhancement curve assessments of being objective measures of underlying \nphysiology that are not affected by variability in scan parameters  However  given the \ndifferent modeling algorithms  multiple challenges and varying potential solutions  each of \nwhich can create significant differences in quantitative measurements  the generalizability of \nindividual studies of advanced pharmacokinetic parameters will require standardization of \nthe technical approach and multicenter testing  34 \n\nDiffusion Weighted MRI  DWI \nDWI is a non-contrast MRI technique that measures the mobility of water molecules in vivo \nand probes tissue organization at the microscopic level  This water movement due to \nmolecular diffusion  called Brownian motion  is random in pure water  However  the motion \nof water molecules in vivo is restricted by hindrances within intracellular and extracellular \ncompartments  As a result  DWI reflects the microscopic cellular environment and is \nsensitive to biophysical characteristics such as cell density  membrane integrity  and \nmicrostructure \n\nDWI has shown promise for the detection and characterization of breast cancer  35  \nNumerous studies have shown that malignant breast lesions exhibit decreased water \ndiffusion  attributed primarily to the increased cell density associated with breast tumors \n 36  DWI is a short scan available on most commercial MR scanners that does not require \nany exogenous contrast and can be added to breast MR imaging examinations to provide \nadditional unique information on tissue microstructural properties \n\nApparent diffusion coefficient  ADC  calculation—DWI utilizes motion-sensitizing \ngradients during MR image acquisition to probe local diffusion characteristics  The \ndiffusion-weighted MRI signal is reduced in intensity proportional to the water mobility  and \nis commonly described by the monoexponential equation \n\n 2 \n\nwhere S0 is the signal intensity without diffusion weighting  SD is the signal intensity with \ndiffusion weighting  b is the applied diffusion sensitization  s/mm2  and ADC is the \napparent diffusion coefficient  defined as the average area a water molecule occupies per \nunit time  mm2/s   37  In general  ADC can be calculated directly from a minimum of two \nacquisitions with different b-values using \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 6\n\nMagn Reson

applications of breast DWI—DWI holds strong potential as an \nadjunct MRI technique to reduce false positives and unnecessary biopsies  This has been the \nmost widely explored application of DWI for breast imaging  and numerous groups have \ndemonstrated restricted water diffusion in breast malignancies and significant differences in \nADC values of benign and malignant lesions  36  39–41   Figs

and malignant lesions varied from 0 90 to 1 76 ×10−3 mm2/s  with \n10/13 studies using a maximum b value of 1000 s/mm2   42  Further  multiple studies \nacross a variety of field strengths have found that ADC measures are complementary to \nDCE-MRI parameters for discriminating benign and malignant breast lesions and can \nincrease the accuracy of conventional breast MRI assessment  43–46 \n\nAnother promising application for DWI is in monitoring of breast cancer treatment  \nAlterations in cell membrane integrity and reduced tumor cellularity due to cytotoxic effects \nof chemotherapy result in increased water mobility within the damaged tumor tissue  A \ncorresponding increase in tumor ADC in response to treatment may be detectable earlier \nthan changes in tumor size or vascularity as measured by DCE-MRI  suggesting DWI may \nprovide valuable early indication of treatment efficacy  47  48  In a recent study of 118 \nwomen undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer  Richard \net al found that pretreatment tumor ADC values differed between intrinsic subtypes and \nwere predictive of pathological response in triple-negative tumors  49 \n\nDWI may also offer a viable non-contrast method of breast MR screening  Many \nmammographically and clinically occult breast cancers detected by DCE-MRI are also \nvisible on DWI  and can be differentiated from benign breast lesions based on ADC  50  In \none study of asymptomatic women  DWI provided higher accuracy than screening \nmammography for the detection of breast malignancies  51  The potential of DWI as a non-\ncontrast alternative for breast MR screening has only been explored in a handful of studies \nand requires further investigation \n\nTechnical challenges of breast DWI—Although a growing number of imaging centers \nare incorporating DWI into the clinical breast MR examination  several factors currently \nlimit widespread clinical implementation  35  The techniques used to acquire DW images \nof the breast  including the choice of b-values  vary considerably across studies in the \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 7\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am  Author

quality of breast DWI due to the particular \nchallenges of off-isocenter imaging  air-tissue interfaces  and significant fat content in the \nbreast  Complete fat suppression is necessary to avoid detrimental chemical shift artifacts in \necho planar DWI and confounding effects of residual intravoxel fat signal on breast tissue \nADC measures  52  Furthermore  differences in data analysis approaches including post-\nprocessing  ADC calculation  and region-of-interest methods result in considerable \ndifferences in the reported ADC values of similar breast pathologies  This lack of \nstandardization in image acquisition and post-processing methods makes it difficult to define \ngeneralizable interpretation strategies for breast DWI and to reliably assess the clinical \nutility of the technique \n\nAdvanced methods of breast DWI—A number of compelling advancements in DWI \nacquisition strategies are under development to overcome the technical issues of spatial \ndistortion and low resolution that currently prevent direct correlation and one-to-one \nmapping of DCE-MRI and DWI features and limit clinical implementation of breast DWI \n 53–56  Furthermore  advanced modeling approaches are also being investigated to extract \nmore valuable biological information from breast DWI scans  These include intravoxel \nincoherent motion  IVIM  modeling  which provides characterization of tissue perfusion in \naddition to diffusion  57–60  diffusion kurtosis modeling  which characterizes deviation \nfrom unrestricted diffusion behavior  evident in vivo at high b-values >1500 s/mm2  and \naccounts for ‘tissue complexity’ or physical barriers to diffusion within tissue  cell \nmembranes  organelles  stromal desmoplasia  etc   58  61  and diffusion tensor imaging \n DTI  which characterizes the directionality of water diffusion in addition to the rate and \nmay provide further insights on glandular organization  ducts  lobules  and \nmicroarchitecture  62–64 \n\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy  MRS  is a noninvasive technique that reflects the \nchemical composition of tissue  Rather than images  MRS techniques produce spatially-\nlocalized signal spectra  with spectral peaks representing the structure and concentration of \ndifferent chemical compounds in that region  MRS can differentiate tissue states such as \nnormal  malignant  necrotic  or hypoxic based on varying levels of associated detectable \nmetabolites  Proton MRS studies of the breast have demonstrated highly elevated levels of \nthe metabolite choline in malignant lesions compared with benign lesions and normal breast \ntissue  65–68  The choline peak observed in vivo  located at approximately 3 2 ppm  \nactually represents a composite of several different choline-containing compounds \n including free choline  phosphocoline and glycerophosphocholine  resolvable using ex vivo \nmethods  69  and is typically referred to as ‘total choline’  tCho  Choline is known to be \ninvolved in cell membrane turnover  phospholipid synthesis and degradation  and is \ntherefore generally considered a marker of cell proliferation  While the underlying \nbiochemical process is not yet well-understood  elevated choline signal in malignancies is \nthought to result from a combination of both increased intracellular phosphocholine \nconcentration and increased cell density in the lesion  69  70 \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 8\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 February 01 \n\nAuthor

Bolan  71  In general  single voxel MRS is the most widely used \nacquisition approach  which produces a single spatially localized spectrum representing the \naverage chemical signal from a 3-dimensional cuboid volume  voxel  centered within a \nlesion identified on contrast-enhanced MRI  Fig  8  Some manufacturers currently offer \nsingle voxel protocols specifically optimized for breast MRS  An alternative localization \ntechnique is chemical-shift imaging  CSI  or MR spectroscopic imaging  MRSI  in which a \nlarger volume is excited and 2D or 3D phase encoding is used to produce a spatially \nresolved grid of spectra  Breast MRS analysis centers on evaluation of the tCho signal  and \nhas been performed using a variety of approaches that can be generally categorized as  1  \nqualitative - detection of the presence of a tCho peak   2  semi-quantitative – measurement \nof tCho SNR  peak height or peak integral  or  3  absolute quantification – calculation of \ntCho concentration  using internal referencing to unsuppressed water signal or external \nreferencing to a phantom with a known chemical concentration   71 \n\nPromising clinical applications of breast MRS—MRS may help to improve the \naccuracy of diagnosing suspicious breast lesions on MRI  1H-MRS measures of choline \nlevels in suspicious breast lesions have been shown to provide high specificity for \ndistinguishing benign from malignant lesions  72–74  The majority of breast MRS studies \nto date have been performed at 1 5T using single voxel approaches  In a recent meta-\nanalysis of 19 breast MRS studies including 1198 lesions  773 malignant  452 benign  \nBaltzer and Dietzel found a pooled sensitivity of 73%  95% CI  85%  91%  and specificity \nof 88%  95% CI  64%  82%  for lesion diagnosis  75  Their analysis did not show any \nsignificant performance advantages of 3T over 1 5T field strength or MRSI over single \nvoxel techniques  or qualitative over quantitative tCho assessments  although the numbers of \nstudies using 3T  n=2/19  and MRSI  n=3/19  were small  More recently  Pinker et al have \nreported a high diagnostic accuracy for assessing suspicious breast lesions using a \nmultiparametric MRI breast examination incorporating MRSI  76 \n\nWhereas simple qualitative detection of the presence of a tCho peak was a reliable marker of \nmalignancy in earlier investigations  77  newer approaches using higher field strengths and \nhigher sensitivity breast coil designs require more quantitative diagnostic methods because \ncholine also becomes detectable even in normal breast tissue at higher SNR levels  71  78  \nA threshold of tCho SNR > 2 is a commonly used threshold for malignancy in prior studies \n\nBreast MRS may play a valuable role in assessing response to neoadjuvant therapy  Breast \ntumor choline levels may reflect treatment-induced alterations in cell proliferation prior to \nany changes in tumor size and thus provide an early predictive marker of treatment response  \nIn support of this  Meisamy and colleagues  70  79  found acute decreases in tumor tCho \nconcentration were measurable at 4T as early as 24 hours after the first-dose of \nchemotherapy and correlated with final changes in tumor size  In a large study of 184 \npatients with breast cancer  Shin et al further showed that tumor tCho measures were higher \nin invasive versus in situ cancers  and correlated with several prognostic factors including \nnuclear grade  histologic grade  and estrogen receptor  ER  status  80 \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page

challenges of breast MRS—There are several challenges to routine clinical \nuse of MRS of the breast  As with breast DWI  high quality shimming and lipid suppression \nare critical for successful breast MRS  Poor shimming results in B0 field inhomogeneities \nthat broaden spectral line widths  causing reduced SNR and a reduced ability to separate \ndifferent chemical resonances  and may also compromise the performance of chemically \nselective fat and water suppression in localized MRS  Shimming can be especially \nchallenging in the breast with regions of mixed fibroglandular and adipose tissues and in the \npresence of metallic biopsy clips  Without adequate fat suppression  lipid sidebands can \nobscure choline peaks in the spectra  A variety of fat suppression strategies have been used \nacross prior breast MRS studies and there is no clear consensus on the optimal method  71  \n75 \n\nA major limitation of breast MRS with current approaches is low sensitivity for detecting \ncholine levels in smaller lesions   100% classified as slow  \nmedium  and fast  respectively  The delayed phase is classified by the curve type after initial \npeak enhancement as persistent  defined as a continuous increase in enhancement of greater \nthan 10% initial enhancement  plateau  constant signal intensity once peak is reached ± \n10% initial enhancement  or washout  decreasing

Ricans  Mexican Americans\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world  Breast \ncancer survivors comprise the largest group of cancer survivors in the US  with an estimated \n2 8 million survivors  1  Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic \nwomen  the second largest race/ethnic group in the US  2  Even though the breast cancer \nprevalence is lower in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites  Hispanic women are \nmore likely to die from breast cancer than non-Hispanic whites  3  which could be related \nto differences in access to treatment and preventive screening  In Puerto Rico  breast cancer \naccounts for 34% of cancers  4  In the US  breast cancer accounts for 28% of cancers in \nHispanics  5  of which most are Mexican Americans \n\nCertain dietary factors have been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer \nrecurrence  These include diets low in fat but high in fruits  vegetables and soy based foods \n 6  7  On the contrary  diets high in alcohol intake and fat dairy products increases the risk \nof recurrence  8  9  Interventions to encourage a high quality dietary pattern should be \nstudied in breast cancer survivors  However  current eating patterns in Hispanic breast cancer \nsurvivors require investigation in order to appropriately adapt dietary interventions for this \npopulation \n\nWithin the Hispanic ethnicity  there are differences in race  country of origin  levels of \nacculturation  English language proficiency  foods preferences  etc  all of which interact \nwith parameters that affect health behaviors  including dietary patterns  Data from the \nHispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos  a population-based cohort study of \nHispanic/Latino adults of diverse backgrounds showed a large variation in dietary patterns \nbetween the group studied  which included Mexican Americans  Puerto Ricans  Dominicans  \nCubans  Central Americans and South Americans  10  For example  this study found the \nlowest fruit intake among Puerto Ricans and the highest among Dominicans and the lowest \nvegetable intake among Dominicans and the highest intake among Mexicans Americans \n\nThus  it is important to study how dietary patterns differ between and within specific ethnic \npopulations so that culturally relevant behavioral interventions to improve dietary patterns \ncan be developed  However  little is known about dietary patterns among the different \nHispanic groups of breast cancer survivors  Therefore  the aims of this study were to \nexamine the dietary patterns  fruits  vegetables  meats  water  sugary beverages  fats  refined \nand whole grains  dairy products  seeds and nuts  alcohol and diet quality  in two groups of \nHispanic breast cancer survivors  Mexicans-Americans and Puerto Ricans  Results from this \nstudy could increase our understanding of the dietary patterns in this group of at-risk \nwomen

in two sites  The University of Texas MD \nAnderson Cancer Center in Houston  Texas and The University of Puerto Rico Cancer \nCenter in San Juan  Puerto Rico  Participants were randomized to a 16-week culturally-\nadapted exercise program  a non-culturally adapted standard exercise intervention or a wait-\nlist control group  At the end of the trial  participants completed a culturally

dairy products and nuts and \nseeds and high intakes of starchy vegetables  refined grains  foods from the protein group  \nparticularly red meat  and calories from solid fats and added sugars  Adherence to the \nDASH-style diet  which emphasizes the intake of plant proteins  fruits and vegetables  \nmoderate amounts of low-fat dairy products  and low amounts of sweets and sodium  was \nsomewhat low and not related to weight status \n\nThese dietary patterns are consistent with those found in other studies in Puerto Rican and \nMexican American individuals  Data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of \nLatinos also reported different dietary patterns among these groups  10  Puerto Ricans had \nthe lowest intake of fruits  1 4 servings/d  vegetables  2 5 servings/d  and fish  0 5 \nservings/d  and highest intake of sugar-sweetened beverages  1 8 servings/d  compared to \nthe other groups  In addition  intake of whole grains was rather low  0 8 servings/d  \ncompared to refined grains  5 6 servings/d  as well as dairy intake  1 6 servings/d  In \nMexican Americans  intake of fruits  1 9 servings/d  vegetables  3 4 servings/d  and whole \ngrains  2 8 servings/d  were higher  intake of dairy products  1 7 servings/d  was similar and \nintake of sweetened beverages  1 5 servings/day  was lower compared to Puerto Ricans  \nThese results are consistent with what we found in the present study  In addition  baseline \ndata from 3 088 breast cancer survivors in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living study  \nwhich included a mix of Hispanics from Mexico  the Caribbean  Central and South America  \nfound similar intakes of fruits  2 7 servings/d  and vegetables  2 7 servings/d   23  compared \nto the Mexican Americans in the present study \n\nThe findings of the present study have important implications for developing interventions \nfor Puerto Rican and Mexican American breast cancer survivors  Based on our results  diet \nquality in general needs improvement  specifically targeting strategies to increase intake of \nvegetables and whole grains  particularly in Puerto Ricans  increase intake of low-fat dairy \nproducts and reduce intake of red meat  added sugars and added fats  such as sugar \nsweetened beverages and fat used for cooking  particularly those high in saturated fat  This \ncould potentially reduce breast cancer

Outcome Expectations among Breast \nCancer Survivors\n\nRachel Hirschey  PhDc  RN  Sharron L  Docherty  PhD  PNP-BC  FAAN  Wei Pan  PhD  and \nIsaac Lipkus  PhD\nDuke University School of Nursing  Durham  North Carolina\n\nAbstract\nBackground—Exercise is associated with decreased recurrence risk  improved survival and \nquality of life for breast cancer survivors  However only an estimated 17% - 37% of survivors \nadhere to the American Cancer Society exercise guidelines  A critical first step to increase exercise \namong survivors is to understand how they believe exercise will effect them \n\nObjective—To explore common exercise outcome expectations among 20 female survivors of \nstage IA – IIB breast cancer who completed adjuvant treatment and an exercise intervention \nInterventions/Methods—A mixed-method descriptive study consisting of semi-structured \ntelephone interviews assessed exercise outcome expectations and how the experience of cancer \nand its treatment influenced expected outcomes of exercise  The qualitative data were analyzed \nusing a summative content analysis procedure  means were calculated for each item of the exercise \noutcome questionnaire  The qualitative and quantitative data were compared and contrasted \n\nResults—The sample was 70% Caucasian and 30% African American with a mean age was 62 \nyears  ± 8 5  and average time since treatment completion of 4 2 years  ± 1 3  Three themes \nemerged from the interviews  1  prevalence of common expectations  2  pervasive impact of \nfatigue  and 3  a brighter future  Overall  findings revealed that breast cancer survivors have low \nlevels of agreement that exercise may mitigate late and long-term cancer and treatment effects \n\nConclusions—In general  breast cancer survivors  even those who are motivated to exercise  do \nnot hold strong beliefs that exercise will decrease late and long-term treatment effects \n\nImplications for Practice—Clinicians can educate survivors about exercise benefits \n\nThe American Cancer Society  ACS  recommends that breast cancer survivors engage in at \nleast 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes/week of strenuous intensity \naerobic exercise and strength training exercises twice weekly 1 However  only 17% – \n37% 2 3 of breast cancer survivors in the United States  US  comply with these activity \nrecommendations  Among those who exercised pre-diagnosis  levels decrease during \nadjuvant therapy and fail to return to pre-diagnosis levels after completion of treatment 4 5 \nThis is remarkable in light of empirical work supporting breast cancer survivors as generally \n\nCorresponding Author  Rachel Hirschey  PhDc  RN  Duke Univerity School of Nursing  307 Trent Dr  Room 3080  Durham  NC

recommended levels may be to explore their \nbeliefs about the results of exercise  In this paper we report on breast cancer survivors' \nknowledge and beliefs about benefits of exercise \n\nFor survivors  remission does not always equate to a return to pre-diagnosis health  \nfunctioning  and quality of life  Advancements in cancer treatments have substantially \ndecreased mortality rates and brought about a surge in the number of long-term survivors  \nwith approximately 2 8 million breast cancer survivors alive in the US today  These \nsurvivors may endure many physical  psychological  emotional  social  and spiritual \nchallenges for up to 10 or more years after finishing treatment 7 8 Long-term effects  such as \nfatigue  are those that begin during and persist beyond the conclusion of primary treatment 9 \n\nLate effects  such as secondary cancers  are those that do not manifest until primary \ntreatment is complete 9\n\nExercise has been shown to decrease many negative long-term and late effects caused by \nchemotherapy  radiation  surgery  and hormone therapy 10 Thus it may become even more \nbeneficial to survivors to exercise after treatment than it was pre-diagnosis  For example  \ncardio-pulmonary gains from exercise are especially significant for survivors who have \nundergone chemotherapy and may be at risk for cardio-pulmonary toxicities and aerobic \ncapacity decline 9 11 Similarly  women who undergo radiation are at risk for bone loss and \nmuscular atrophy 12 both of which are improved by regular exercise 13 14 Further  exercise \nimproves quality of life for breast cancer survivors through decreasing treatment effects \nincluding fatigue 14 15 pain 16 17 decreased self-esteem 18 trouble concentrating 19 weight \ngain 20 21 depression 22 and disrupted sleep 23 Finally  due to the association of exercise and \nrecurrence risk reduction  exercise may improve QOL by providing a sense of control to the \nestimated 34% of breast cancer survivors who fear recurrence to the degree that it effects \nquality of life 24 Because exercise lessens long-term effects and is associated with a 20-50% \nlower risk of recurrence 25-29 it is especially advantageous for survivors  Yet the extent to \nwhich survivors are aware of these benefits and recognize their increased need for exercise is \nnot well known \n\nA critical step in increasing exercise among survivors is understanding what outcomes they \nexpect from exercise  that is outcome expectations  OEs  OEs refer to what people expect to \nobtain or avoid by engaging in a behavior  Simply stated  people exercise because they \nbelieve it will produce desired and avoid undesired outcomes 30 Understanding survivors' \nOEs is key to understanding their exercise behavior  OEs are highly influential in predicting \nhealth behaviors and are thus central to key theoretical frameworks of health behavior \nchange such as social cognitive theory 30 theory of planned behavior 31 and transtheoretical \nmodel 32 Among non-cancer populations  individuals who expect more positive and less \nnegative outcomes are more likely to exercise 33 34 Understanding survivors' exercise OEs \nmay provide insights to clinicians and researchers about how to promote exercise among \nsurvivors  Identification of more and less recognized OEs will illuminate which OEs to \nreinforce and which to introduce \n\nHirschey et al  Page 2\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

only one study that identified OEs among survivors who have \ncompleted adjuvant treatment 35 Findings indicated that among 8 survivors  common \nexercise OEs include enjoyment  increased energy  feeling good mentally  and maintaining a \nhealthy weight 35 Exercise effects on late and long-term treatment effects  such as recurrence \nrisk were not identified by survivors in this study  Thus the purpose of this study was to \nexplore common exercise OEs among breast cancer survivors and develop a deeper \nunderstanding of their beliefs about exercise \n\nMethod\nDesign\n\nA mixed-method descriptive design was used to explore exercise-related outcome \nexpectations in women post breast cancer treatment \n\nRecruitment\nA convenience sample of twenty female survivors of stage IA – IIB breast cancer were \nrecruited  The sample was post adjuvant treatment and had completed an exercise \nintervention study 36 at an academic tertiary care center in the southeastern US within the \nlast year  The parent study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial that included a 16–\nweek lab based aerobic exercise intervention  Participants were randomized to either \nmoderate-intensity exercise  strenuous-intensity exercise  or an attention control stretching \ngroup  It is not our intention to examine effect of group assignment on OEs as all groups \nengaged in some intensity of exercise  Because this sample had exercised  it was identified \nas an ideal group of women to provide preliminary insights into the exercise outcomes that \nmay be most motivating and thus important to target in future exercise interventions for \nbreast cancer survivors  The study prescribed to state and national ethical standards  and was \napproved by the medical center Institutional Review Board \n\nProcedures\nA semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct telephone interviews to assess \nexercise outcome expectations and if and how the experience of cancer and its treatment/s \ninfluenced expected exercise outcomes  At the beginning of the interview “regular exercise” \nwas defined by the interviewer as 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical \nactivity and examples of fast walking  baseball  tennis  and easy bicycling were provided  \nThe interview questions  see Table 1 for interview guide  were selected based on a literature \nreview of OEs and consultations with experts in exercise oncology as well as experts in OEs  \nThe telephone interviews began with open-ended questions about participants' exercise OEs  \nmoving them first through their expectations about exercise in general  and then specific \nOEs related to cancer and treatment effects  such as recurrence risk  After the open ended \nquestions were asked  participants' answers to the exercise specific questions were elicited \nby using the Outcome Expectations for Exercise  OEE  Questionnaire 37 which was \nadministered by the investigator during the interview  The measure uses a 5-point scale  1 = \nstrongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree  to assess levels of agreement that exercise will \nresult in 9 positive outcomes  This measure was selected because it has demonstrated \n\nHirschey et al  Page 3\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

ask about exercise outcomes specific to breast \ncancer and its treatment  we modified the OEE questionnaire by adding 15 items to assess \nlevel of agreement about exercise specific to breast cancer survivors  These breast cancer \nspecific items were identified through a review of empirical studies  Items with both \ncausative and correlational support were included  Face validity of the additional 15 items \nwas agreed on by the first author  last author and an exercise physiologist who has expertise \nin oncology  See Table 2 for items from the Modified Outcome Expectations for Exercise \nQuestionnaire including those from the OEE and the breast cancer specific items that were \nadded  All interviews were conducted by the first author and digitally recorded  On average  \nthe interviews lasted 18 minutes  Notes were taken during the interviews and all recordings \nwere reviewed twice  by the first author  to confirm accuracy of written notes \n\nData analysis\nThe qualitative data were analyzed using a summative content analysis procedure  First  the \ncontent of the interviews related to exercise OEs was identified and quantified  Next  latent \nanalysis was conducted to make meaning of the exercise OEs 39 Alternative terms for \ncommon keywords and content were identified and their contexts were examined  The \ntrustworthiness of the qualitative analysis and findings were strengthened by the following \nprocedures  An audit trail was created to document data collection  coding and analysis \ndecisions  Reflexive memos where made by the first author  immediately following the \ninterviews and these notes were reviewed in conjunction with the audio recordings to \nidentify linkages  gaps and questions  Peer debriefing was completed between the first and \nlast author to discuss emerging findings  throughout data analysis  Specifically  throughout \ndata collection and analysis  the two researchers met on a weekly basis to review interview \ncontent and discuss analysis and findings  The first author also consulted with a qualitative \ndata analysis expert on three occasions to discuss emergent findings \n\nThe quantitative data were analyzed by calculating means and standard deviations for each \nitem on the modified OEE questionnaire  Results from the quantitative and qualitative \nanalyses were linked to ascertain whether they confirm  refute  or otherwise extend or \nmodify each other  and the interview findings offered potential explanations for the \nquantitative findings \n\nParticipant demographics and characteristics of the parent study were collected to assure \nscientists and clinicians working to increase exercise among breast cancer survivors will be \nable to evaluate usefulness of study findings for the patients with whom they interact \n\nResults\nDemographic and medical-related characteristics\n\nThe sample  n=20  was 70% Caucasian and 30% African American  The mean age was 62 \nyears  ± 8 5

Data\nParticipants were asked  using both broad open-ended and specific questions  to talk about \ntheir exercise-related outcome expectations  Overall  responses were consistently non-\nspecific and provided minimal details  For example  many participants said they expect to \nfeel better from exercise  but despite probing for greater detail  were unable to discuss in \nwhat way or how  Participants predominately discussed mental or psychological benefits of \nexercise with greater detail provided for psychological than physical benefits  Even when \nasked to focus specifically on physical outcomes  most defaulted to discussing mental health \nbenefits or concluded with final thoughts about the importance of exercise to psychological \nhealth  Importantly  participants did not discuss exercise outcomes related to treatment \neffects such as decreased recurrence risk or improved cardiac health  Overall they seemed \nunaware of the potential benefits that exercise has to ameliorate negative health effects of \ncancer and its treatments  Three general themes emerged from analysis of the interviews  1  \nprevalence of common expectations  2  pervasive impact of fatigue  and 3  a brighter future \n\nPrevalence of common expectations—Participants identified and focused \npredominately on the benefits that exercise has for the general  non-cancer population  The \nsix most commonly reported expected outcomes or OEs included increased energy  feeling \ngood overall  cardiac health  general health  feeling good mentally and achieving healthy \nweight  When prompted to talk about exercise outcomes in relation to how it may influence \neffects associated with their cancer treatments  they had difficulty identifying specific \nbenefits  This sample of women was not able to identify the added benefit that exercise has \nfor those who had survived cancer and its treatment  For example  none spontaneously \ndiscussed decreased recurrence risk as an exercise OE  When probed to talk about how their \nexperience with cancer and treatments has changed what they expected to experience from \nexercise  30% said they thought exercise might decrease their recurrence risk  One woman \nexplained that she did not learn this from her health care providers and stressed that nurses \nshould educate patients about the association of exercise with recurrence risk  She said \n\n“Breast cancer is less likely to occur in the first place and less likely to recur if you \nexercise - I never knew this  I only learned this through the study [referring to the \nparent RCT]  My doctor actually told me to stop walking the dog during treatment - \nI didn't listen to her  I decided that was the worst advice I ever got  I would have \nlost out if I had listened  I walked through my whole treatment  In fact  nurses are \nimportant in relaying the message about exercise and cancer  I didn't get any of this \ninformation through treatment ”\n\nTalk about the heightened benefits of exercise for cancer survivors was limited to two \nparticipants  10%  who provided examples of an increased need for exercise due to \ntreatment effects  One participant discussed her expectation that exercise would mitigate \nproblems she has with her heart that resulted from cancer treatment  Another woman said  \n“Even now five years later I still have some side effects - major joint and bone pain  Exercise \nworks best to help with this ”\n\nHirschey et al  Page 5\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

to exercise  Increased energy was the most common theme participants \nsaid they enjoyed or would enjoy most from exercise  However  others  40%  expressed \nextreme fatigue  most often a result of hormone therapy  as a barrier to exercise  One \nparticipant stated she has “scaled back what I expect  I have problems with my energy  \ntamoxifen almost killed me  and my body is still trying to recover from the treatments ” \nSimilarly  another participant expressed that she needs to exercise more but she is too tired  \nshe said “cancer  radiation  then that medication I took for a year zapped my energy ” \nSeveral participants explained that they are simply too fatigued to exercise and saved their \nenergy for other higher priority life activities \n\nA brighter future—Many participants  35%  focused and elaborated on the psychological \nbenefits they have or expect to experience from exercise  When the women talked about \nphysical benefits  they tended to just list them  however  those who experienced mental \nbenefits discussed them in more detail  While participants valued both physical and \npsychological outcomes of exercise  the psychological outcomes were described as the most \npowerful in affecting their lives  One woman explained  “you really need to focus on mental \nbenefits of exercise for breast cancer and control is a big issue too  you are dealing with not \nbeing in control  exercise is something you can do ” Another participant explained that \nexercise really helped her to survive cancer  she said “to go through diagnosis and treatment \nand the aftermath is a lot to go through  Personally I think exercise makes it brighter at the \nend  That you want to stay healthier  you want to eat healthier  you look at life differently \nbecause of the diagnosis  A lot of people say cancer  oh god  you hear a lot of women die \nand you hear the good stories and I say I'm a survivor ” Participants did not discuss the \npersonal importance of physical outcomes \n\nQuantitative data\nOur intent in using the OEE measure was to quantitatively explore potential exercise \noutcomes participants thought exercise was most and least likely to produce  Cronbach's \nalpha of the modified measure for this sample is 0 94  demonstrating excellent reliability  \nThe mean agreement scores and standard deviations from the modified OEE measure are \npresented in Table 3  Mean level of agreement scores for each item were calculated and \nranged from 2 8  outcome participants least agreed would result from exercise  to 1 1 \n outcomes participants most agreed would result from exercise  The average level of \nagreement score was 1 9 for psychological outcomes  1 7 for physical outcomes and 1 7 \noverall  We used the mean level of agreement score of 1 7 to divide the outcomes into those \nparticipants most agreed would result from exercise  score <1 7  and those participants who \nleast agreed with what would result from exercise  score ≥ 1 7  Notable items with a mean \nagreement score ≥ 1 7 include  reducing long-term effects of treatment  feeling less tired  \nsleeping better  increasing length of life  reducing recurrence risk  increasing mental \nalertness and decreasing risk of osteoporotic bone fractures  These items are noteworthy as  \ndespite empirical support of their benefit  they were those least endorsed by this sample of \nsurvivors \n\nHirschey et al  Page 6\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

whether they confirmed or \nrefuted each other  The qualitative data was used to make meaning of the quantitative data  \nWe first explored how often items with less agreement on the OEE measure  i e  scores \nabove 1 7  were mentioned during the interview  Again  the quantitative results indicated \nthat participants reported lower levels of agreement in relation to exercise resulting in

their fear of recurrence 41  \nHowever  recurrence risk reduction did not spontaneously come up in the qualitative \ninterviews  When asked more specifically about potential exercise outcomes in relations to \nhaving cancer and treatments  30% mentioned recurrence risk reduction  Finally when asked \nas part of the OEE measure  risk reduction was rated with a lower level of agreement  m = \n1 7  and several participants paused and made comments such as “huh  I have no idea”  “I \nreally don't know”  “I really hope so  so I'm going to have to say one ”\n\nIn summary both the qualitative and quantitative data supported that among a sample of \nwomen who are motivated to complete an exercise study  there are low levels of agreement \nthat exercise may mitigate several significant late and long-term cancer and treatment \neffects \n\nDiscussion\nOverall  findings from this study highlight that despite extensive evidence that exercise \neffectively treats many long-term and late treatment effects  survivors who are motivated to \nexercise may still be unaware or question these potential benefits  While this sample \ngenerally has positive expectations of exercise  they still hold some doubt about the efficacy \nof exercise as a treatment for long term cancer effects  Given these findings among a sample \nof survivors who have exercised  knowledge related to exercise benefits among those who \nare not motivated to exercise is highly questionable  Breast cancer survivors' OEs may be \nsimilar to those of non-cancer survivors  The qualitative data revealed that the most common \nOEs of breast cancer survivors are increased energy  feeling good overall  cardiac health  \ngeneral health  feeling good mentally  and achieving healthy weight  These findings are \nsimilar to those of Short and Colleagues  2013  who report that breast cancer survivors \nanticipate enjoyment  increased energy  feeling good mentally and maintaining a healthy \nweight as effects of physical activity  Thus there is an opportunity to increase awareness \nabout the exercise benefits that extend beyond those for the general population to those that \ndecrease late and long term cancer and treatment effects \n\nMean scores from the quantitative data indicate that outcomes breast cancer survivors least \nagree exercise will produce are  decreasing long-term effects of breast cancer treatment  \n\nHirschey et al  Page 7\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

osteoporotic bone fractures  These \nqualitative and quantitative data are congruent  Specifically  none of the items with a low  ≥ \n1 7  quantitative agreement score  i e  outcomes survivors are least likely exercise will \nproduce  were discussed by participants in the qualitative interviews  The absence of low \nagreement outcomes in the qualitative data confirm the finding that survivors do not agree  \nare unaware  or rarely think about exercise resulting in such outcomes  Especially notable is \nthe low scores for recurrence risk and lack of recurrence risk in the qualitative data  These \nfindings support each other in that overall  survivors are unsure of the efficacy of exercise to \ndecrease recurrence risk  Both survivors who do and do not exercise  should be made aware \nof the association between exercise and risk recurrence \n\nIncreased awareness of the numerous diverse positive outcomes of exercise may motivate \nbreast cancer survivors to exercise more  The greatest concerns among breast cancer \nsurvivors include fear of recurrence  fatigue  sleep disturbance  neuropathy  concerns about \nlong-term effects of treatment  weight changes  and sexual issues 7 all of which exercise can \npositively impact  Generally  cancer survivors are motivated to engage in behaviors they \nbelieve will improve their health including exercise 41 Thus  it is possible that increased \nawareness of the efficacy of exercise to improve long term and late effects may motivate \nsedentary survivors to exercise and help maintain or increase activity among active \nsurvivors \n\nIn addition to increasing knowledge about exercise benefits  highlighting psychological \noutcomes may be especially effective to increase exercise among breast cancer survivors  \nThis sample  of survivors who have exercised  discussed psychological OEs in greater detail \nthan physical outcomes  Participants explained that they enjoy the psychological outcomes \nof exercise and that these benefits are especially important given the emotional challenges of \ngoing through cancer and treatment  These findings indicate that psychological outcomes are \ncrucial to focus on in exercise interventions among this population \n\nFatigue plays a significant role in breast cancer survivors' decisions to exercise  Cancer-\nrelated fatigue is defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network as “a distressing \npersistent subjective sense of physical  emotional  and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion \nrelated to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and that \ninterferes with usual functioning ” 42 Cancer-related fatigue persists up to ten years into \nsurvivorship 43 44 Increased energy was one of the most common OEs in the qualitative data  \nyet the quantitative data indicates low levels of agreement that exercise will help survivors \nfeel less tired and sleep better  This contradiction confirms the pervasive nature of fatigue \nrelated to exercise  as survivors identify fatigue as both a great benefit of and barrier to \nexercise  Indeed  survivors who exercise consistently report having more energy 45 Further \nresearch is needed to identify how to break down fatigue as an exercise barrier so that \nsurvivors may exercise to enjoy higher levels of energy and an improved quality of life  \nSimilarly  efforts are needed to increase levels of exercise to decrease fatigue experienced by \nsurvivors \n\nHirschey et al  Page 8\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March

motivated survivors actively \nengaged in an exercise intervention  limiting generalizability of findings to all breast cancer \nsurvivors  Yet  this sample provided great initial insights into what may motivate exercise \namong survivors  However  because all participants completed a 16-week lab based exercise \noncology intervention at a large research hospital  it is reasonable to consider that these \nparticipants are more aware of exercise outcomes  compared to other breast cancer survivors  \nThis indicates that among the larger breast cancer population  there is likely an even greater \nneed to shine light on the benefits of exercise related to cancer and treatment effects  \nAnother study weakness is the accuracy with which the quantitative measure assessed OEs  \nItems on the measure were asked after participants had thought about and discussed \noutcomes of exercise  Thus  these conversations may have primed participants and impacted \ntheir rating \n\nImplications of these findings\nClinicians working with breast cancer survivors have an opportunity to educate survivors \nabout the role exercise plays in managing late and long-term side effects  Connections \nbetween the heightened need for exercise due to treatment effects should be outlined for \npatients  Particular attention should be given to the association between exercise and \nrecurrence risk reduction  Overall  research is needed to identify the most effective strategies \nto increase breast cancer survivors' exercise OEs  as a means to increase exercise  OEs have \nseveral dimensions including 1  importance – value placed on the outcome s 46 47 2  \ncertainty - perceived probability outcome s  will occur 46 48 and 3  accessibility – the \nfrequency with which outcome s  are considered 46 49 50 Interventions that simultaneously \nenhance all these dimensions may be most effective to increase exercise  In summary  it may \nbe necessary to both increase survivors' awareness of diverse exercise outcomes as well as \nenhance the importance and certainty of these outcomes \n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Dr  Lee Jones  the principle investigator of the randomized

\n\nMethods—Breast cancer survivors  n=200  were recruited at their first post-surgical surveillance \nmammogram  6-15 months post-surgery  Women without a breast cancer history  n=150  were \nrecruited at the time of a routine screening mammogram  All women completed measures of \nbreast pain  pain interference with daily activities and intimacy  worry about breast pain  anxiety \nsymptoms  and depression symptoms  Demographic and medical information were also collected \n\nResults—Persistent breast pain  duration ≥ 6 months  was reported by 46 5% of breast cancer \nsurvivors and 12 7% of women without a breast cancer history  p<0 05  Breast cancer survivors \nalso had significantly higher rates of clinically significant persistent breast pain  pain intensity \nscore ≥3/10  as well as higher average breast pain intensity and unpleasantness scores  Breast \ncancer survivors with persistent breast pain had significantly higher levels of depressive \nsymptoms  as well as pain worry and interference  compared to survivors without persistent breast \npain or women without a breast cancer history  Anxiety symptoms were significantly higher in \nbreast cancer survivors

with a \nhistory of breast conserving cancer surgery compared to women without that history  Strategies to \nameliorate persistent breast pain and to improve adjustment among women with persistent breast \npain should be explored for incorporation into standard care for breast cancer survivors \n\nKeywords\npersistent breast pain  breast cancer  breast surgery  surgical pain\n\nWith approximately 230 000 women diagnosed each year  breast cancer affects more women \nin the United States than any other cancer [1]  For most women with breast cancer  curative \ntreatment includes breast surgery  with either a full or partial mastectomy accompanied by \nsentinel or comprehensive axillary lymph node resection [2  3]  Accumulating evidence \nsuggests that a substantial proportion of women experience persistent breast pain after breast \nsurgery [4-6]  The prevalence of persistent pain in breast cancer survivors following surgery \nhas been reported to range from 25-60% across studies [4-11]  with little indication of \ndiminution over the months and years following surgery [5  8  10] \n\nThe majority of studies examining persistent pain following breast surgery have focused on \ncomparing breast cancer survivors with and without persistent post-surgical pain  The \nprevalence of persistent breast pain in breast cancer survivors has rarely been compared to \nwomen without a breast cancer history  Yet  considerable evidence from survey studies \nsuggests that chronic  noncyclical  mastalgia is common among healthy women [12]  To our \nknowledge  only one published study of persistent pain following breast cancer surgery has \nincluded a comparison group of women with no history of breast cancer [4]  That study  \nusing mailed questionnaires  found that 24% of women had persistent breast pain following \nbreast cancer surgery  while 10% of women without a history of breast cancer reported \nsimilar symptoms [4] \n\nIn the present study  we examined persistent breast pain in breast cancer survivors and a \ncomparison group of women with no history of breast cancer or breast surgery  All women \nwere recruited and assessed in person in a breast imaging clinic prior to a routine \nsurveillance mammogram  Breast cancer survivors in this study had all been treated with \nbreast conserving surgery  e g  lumpectomy  quadrantectomy  partial or segmental \nmastectomy  and were undergoing their first post-treatment surveillance mammogram  six \nto fifteen months post-surgery  Prevalence of persistent breast pain and clinically significant \npersistent breast pain were compared across breast cancer survivors and women with no \nbreast cancer history  To explore the impact of persistent breast pain  levels of anxiety \nsymptoms  depression symptoms  worry  and pain interference with activities of daily life \nwere also examined \n\nMethod\nParticipants\n\nWomen were recruited from two academic medical centers located in the northeastern \nUnited States and southeastern United States between June 2009 and October 2011  Two \n\nEdmond et al  Page 2\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 January 01

history of breast cancer \nand women without a breast cancer history  Women with breast cancer were eligible if they \nwere at least 21 years old  were diagnosed with Stage I-IIIA breast cancer  were treated with \nbreast conserving surgery  e g  lumpectomy  quadrantectomy  partial or segmental \nmastectomy  and were within 6 to 15 months post breast cancer surgery \n\nWomen without a history of breast cancer were eligible if they were age 40 or older  \nundergoing a routine screening mammogram and had never undergone breast surgery  Breast \ncancer survivors were recruited at the time of their first post-treatment mammogram  women \nwithout a cancer history were approached in the same week as a breast cancer survivor \n\nProcedures\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both sites  Eligibility was \nassessed via medical record review  under a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct  HIPAA  waiver obtained for this purpose  Prospective participants were contacted by a \nletter from the breast imaging clinic at least two weeks prior to the date of their scheduled \nmammogram  On the date of their scheduled mammogram  prospective participants were \napproached in the breast imaging clinic by research staff and informed consent procedures \nwere conducted in a private area of the clinic  Women then completed questionnaires \ndescribed below  as part of a larger longitudinal study examining predictors of \nmammography adherence  Keefe  R01-CA-131148-05 \n\nMeasures\n\nSocio-demographic and medical characteristics—Information on age  education  \nrace  marital status  employment status  and comorbid illnesses were collected from each \nparticipant  Information about medical background was also collected  including \nmenopausal status  For breast cancer survivors  information specific to breast cancer  \nincluding stage at diagnosis  type of surgical treatment  receipt of adjuvant therapy  and \ndates of cancer treatments were also collected from the medical record \n\nBreast pain—Breast pain intensity  unpleasantness  duration  frequency  and location were \nassessed  Breast pain-related interference  worry  and medication use were also measured  \nPain intensity  We used three items from the Brief Pain Inventory  BPI [13] modified to \nassess breast pain  Women were asked to rate  1  the worst breast pain intensity during the \npast month  2  the average breast pain during the past month  and 3  current breast pain  on a \n0  no pain  to 10  worst pain imaginable  scale  These three items were averaged to create a \ntotal score  Consistent with prior studies [4  9]  clinically significant breast pain was defined \nas having a pain intensity score of ≥3 out of 10  Although some studies use a more stringent \npain intensity cutoff of ≥4  we chose ≥3 out of 10 because we anticipated relatively low \nlevels of breast pain in women without a history of breast cancer or breast surgery  The BPI \nhas demonstrated adequate reliability and sensitivity in prior studies[7  14]  Cronbach's \nalpha in this sample was 0 89  Pain unpleasantness  Women rated the average unpleasantness \nof breast pain in the past month using a 0-100 visual analog scale  VAS  with 0 indicating \nnot bad at all and 100 indicating the most intense unpleasantness imaginable[15  16]  Pain \nDuration  Women were asked how long they had experienced breast pain  i e  less than six \n\nEdmond et al  Page 3\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 January 01

life  Having persistent \nbreast pain was defined as having breast pain for ≥6 months  Clinically significant persistent \nbreast pain was defined as having a pain intensity score of ≥3 out of 10 and breast pain \nduration of ≥6 months  Pain frequency  Women were asked to indicate how often they \nexperienced breast pain  i e  never  less than monthly  monthly  weekly  daily  or hourly  \nLocation of pain  Women completed full body maps to indicate areas where they \nexperienced pain  Additionally  they completed a more detailed body map  showing the \nchest  shoulders  and upper arms  to indicate locations of breast pain[17]  Pain Interference  \nWomen were asked to rate the degree to which breast pain interfered with daily activities \nand sexual activities/intimacy in the past month using 0  none  to 10  extreme  scales  \nadapted from the Brief Pain Inventory[13]  Items were averaged to create an interference \nscore  Worry  Women indicated the degree to which they worry that breast pain may be a \nsign of breast cancer on a 0 to 10 scale  0=no worry  10=extreme worry  Medication use  \nWomen were asked how often they took pain medication for breast pain  i e  never  \nsometimes/not every month  monthly  or daily \n\nDepression and anxiety—The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  HADS [18] is \nwidely used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in primary care patients  cancer \npatients  and the general population  The HADS is a 14-item measure with two subscales  \nAnxiety  HADS-A  7 items  and Depression  HADS-D  7 items  Women rate each item \nover the past week on a 4-point scale that ranges from 0 to 3  For each subscale  items are \ntotaled to yield a score that ranges from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating greater \nsymptoms[19]  The HADSA and HADS-D demonstrated good internal consistency in this \nsample  alpha= 87 and  81  respectively \n\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were computed  Bivariate analyses  e g  chi square and t tests as \nappropriate  were conducted to determine if breast cancer survivors and women without a \nbreast cancer history differed  p<0 05  on demographic or medical variables  Subsequent \nanalyses comparing these study groups controlled for race  as race differed by group  \nLogistic regression and analysis of covariance  ANCOVA  were conducted to examine \ndifferences in pain-related variables for breast cancer survivors and women with no breast \ncancer history  Finally  differences in symptoms of anxiety  depression  pain interference  \nand worry about breast pain were examined among three groups  breast cancer survivors \nwith persistent breast pain  breast cancer survivors without persistent breast pain  and \nwomen without a breast cancer history  using logistic regression and ANCOVA models  All \nmodels included demographic variables that were associated  p<0 05  with persistent breast \npain or the dependent variables in bivariate analyses  Demographic variables included in \nmodels were age  race  0=non-white  1=white  and marital status  0=not partnered  \n1=partnered  Group comparisons were examined using a pairwise family error

variables with a few exceptions  time since \nsurgery was positively correlated with anxiety  r = 0 15  p=0 04  and depression  r=0 20  \np=0 01  such that longer time since surgery was associated with greater symptoms of \nanxiety and depression \n\nDiscussion\nPersistent breast pain was reported by almost half  46 5%  of the breast cancer survivors in \nthis study compared to only 12 7% of women without a breast cancer history  The study \nfurther revealed that breast cancer survivors with persistent breast pain had higher levels of \ndepression symptoms  worry about pain  and pain interference than breast cancer survivors \nwithout persistent breast pain  or women without a breast cancer history  Together these \nfindings suggest a substantial impact of persistent breast pain in the lives of breast cancer \nsurvivors \n\nSeveral prior studies have found symptoms of depression to be associated with persistent \nbreast pain in breast cancer survivors [20  21]  but this relationship has been inconsistent \nacross studies [9  22]  Pre-operative depression has been identified as a potential risk factor \nfor the development of persistent post-surgical pain in longitudinal studies of patients \nundergoing orthopedic surgery[23]  cardiac surgery[24]  lumbar discectomy[25]  and in \nwomen after breast cancer surgery[26-28]  However  other studies have not found a \nsignificant association between pre-operative depression and persistent post-surgical \npain[29  30]  Thus  the relationship between depressive symptoms and persistent post-\nsurgical pain continues to be difficult to clarify from a causal perspective  We also found that \nanxiety symptoms were higher among women with a history of breast cancer and persistent \nbreast pain as compared to women without a history of breast cancer or breast surgery  \nconsistent with other studies that reported an association between pain and anxiety [9  20  \n21  27  30  31]  however  in this cross-sectional study it is not possible to say if anxiety was \npresent prior to the development of persistent breast pain  More research is needed to \nimprove understanding of the development of persistent breast pain over time and how it \nrelates to psychosocial distress  e g  longitudinal studies to examine the relationships among \npre- and post-surgical depression  anxiety  and pain \n\nAmong breast cancer survivors with persistent breast pain  61 3% reported clinically \nsignificant persistent breast pain  i e  a pain intensity score of 3 or greater  which is similar \nto results from prior studies[9  20  27]  At the same time  only 19 3% of breast cancer \nsurvivors with persistent breast pain reported ever taking pain medication for their breast \npain  Prior research has suggested that cancer patients are often hesitant to take pain \nmedication [32]  and interventions aimed at reducing barriers to taking pain medication may \n\nEdmond et al  Page

helping \nwomen better manage their pain and improve quality of life \n\nThis study has several strengths  To our knowledge  it is the second study to compare \nwomen with a history of breast cancer to a group of women without a breast cancer history \non measures of persistent breast pain  and the first to do so in the United States  It is also the \nfirst study of persistent breast pain to concurrently examine psychological distress among \nbreast cancer survivors and women without a breast cancer history  Additionally  this study \nexamines women who are 6 to 15 months post-surgery  while most literature in this area has \nstudied women five or more years post-surgery  Examining correlates of persistent breast \npain in the years immediately following surgery is important  because it provides the \nopportunity to identify modifiable factors that may emerge soon after treatment  Additional \nresearch that contributes to a better understanding of modifiable factors contributing to \npersistent breast pain and its impact among women undergoing breast-conserving surgery is \nneeded \n\nThis study also has several limitations  The observational  cross-sectional  study design \nlimits our ability to draw causal conclusions  Future research should follow women \nprospectively to better understand factors contributing to the development of persistent \nbreast pain and how the report of persistent breast pain changes over time both prior to and \nfollowing surgery  We used a relatively liberal pain intensity cutoff of ≥3 out of 10 for 6 \nmonths or longer to define persistent breast pain in our sample  while other studies have \nused ≥4 out of 10  Given that over 50% of our sample reported no pain  we may be capturing \nthe experience of relatively mild pain as compared to other studies of women of moderate to \nsevere breast pain  Our sample was largely white and primarily well-educated  and lacked \nrepresentation from a number of ethnicities and races  which limits our ability to generalize \nour results to other groups of women  Further  we recruited women from two academic \nmedical centers presenting for scheduled mammograms  and patients who come to these \nfacilities may differ from women in the community who seek treatment elsewhere or women \nwho do not schedule mammograms  Future research should broaden recruitment strategies \nto determine if the prevalence and correlates of persistent breast pain are similar in other  \nmore diverse populations  Finally  this study is unable to examine the impact of cancer as \ncompared to surgery as it influences persistent breast pain  nor does it explicitly examine \nhow surgical variables or cancer-related variables  e g  stage  time since surgery  influence \npersistent breast pain  Future studies may want to use other control groups  such as women \nundergoing breast surgery who do not have cancer  to further examine these relationships \n\nIn this study  we sought to examine differences in persistent breast pain among breast cancer \nsurvivors who were treated with breast conserving surgery and women without a history of \nbreast cancer  and found that breast cancer survivors reported significantly higher rates of \npersistent breast pain  We also examined rates of depression symptoms  anxiety symptoms  \nworry  and pain interference in this sample  and found that breast cancer survivors with \npersistent breast pain experience greater depression symptoms  worry about breast pain  and \npain interference than those without persistent breast pain  These findings highlight the \nimportance of further research to better understand factors involved in persistent breast pain \n\nEdmond et al  Page 8\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript

nonpuerperal inflammatory breast\n\nsyndrome  we found that half of the patients had IBC  While clinical and radiological features\n\nmay help initial diagnosis  they are non-specific and follow-up and biopsy are mandatory in\n\ncase of persisting inflammatory breast despite treatment \n\nThis high rate of IBC is an important finding especially as it contrasts with two previous\n\nmain studies reporting inflammatory breast syndrome [1  5]  In 2009  Kamal et al  [5] found\n\nthat 5 6% of patients had IBC in a cohort of 197 patients with mastitis  Similarly  Froman et al \n\n[1] reported a rate of 4 5% of IBC in a cohort of 23 patients presenting with red breast syndrome\n\nafter screening more than 3700 women presenting at their breast unit over a 2-year period  The\n\nfirst probable explanation for such a difference is that  unlike these two studies  we excluded\n\nwomen who were pregnant or in the postpartum period from our cohort  Inflammatory breast\n\nduring breastfeeding is common and does not represent a challenge either for diagnosis or for\n\nTable 5  MRI analysis \nCharacteristics Number of patients\n\n n = 20 \nMissing data Infectious\n\n n = 1 \nInflammatory\n n =

improving management of women suffering with inflammatory breast syndrome \n\nWe believe that the high rate of IBC we report here is probably closer to what clinicians may\n\nencounter in everyday practice \n\nThe clinical distinction between true IBC and neglected breast cancer progression may\n\nprove delicate in some cases  This distinction is clinically relevant since the treatment strategy\n\nmight differ  In our cohort  we cannot exclude that some of the cases of IBC were in fact cases\n\nof neglected cancer progression  Some authors report clinical diagnostic differences between\n\nthese two scenario that are easily picked up on during physical examination [7  12–14]  For\n\nexample  patients with IBC may experience a rapid increase in breast volume almost simulta-\n\nneously with the skin changes which are highly evocative of IBC  in our cohort  skin thickening\n\nand indurated skin was observed in 55% and 73% of women with IBC  respectively  Most\n\npatients with IBC do not present a palpable mass on physical examination [14]  In our cohort \n\nhowever  the most relevant symptom suggestive of malignancy at the time of the consultation\n\nwas the perception of a mass  78 9%  on physical examination  Therefore  while this sign may\n\nbe unusual in IBC  any perception of a mass by the patient or the clinician warrants further\n\ninvestigation including systematic breast or skin biopsy in case of doubt \n\nBreast ultrasonography and a mammography were particularly useful diagnostic tools in\n\nour cohort  On ultrasonography  the only factor significantly associated with IBC was the pres-\n\nence of precise limits of the mass  Other authors report similar results [5  15]  However  a nor-\n\nmal ultrasonography does not in itself rule out IBC  Indeed  Gunhan et al  [16] reported\n\nabsence of a mass in 20% of authentic cases of IBC and no skin changes in 4% of those cases \n\nMammography is usually less specific to differentiate between mastitis and IBC  Crowe et al \n\n[17] reported that the most relevant sign of IBC was diffuse skin thickening  Mammography\n\nwas highly relevant in our cohort  As mentioned before  the presence of a mass  of calcifica-\n\ntions or of a focal asymmetry were significantly associated with a malignant lesion though not\n\nspecific of IBC  Several authors have assessed the performance of MRI for the diagnosis of IBC\n\n[16  18–20]  This exam is usually prescribed after ultrasonography and mammography in case\n\nof doubt  Sixteen patients with IBC underwent a breast MRI in our cohort  Presence of mass \n\nlocal enhancement and suspicious lymph nodes were strongly evocative of a malignant lesion \n\nWhile some authors [1  3] have developed algorithms for the management of inflammatory\n\nbreast  we believe that the need for such an algorithm is questionable  The main issue at hand\n\nis to rapidly identify all cases of IBC  a particularly aggressive cancer  in women presenting\n\nwith inflammatory breast syndrome  Unfortunately  our data were limited regarding the time\n\nlapse between first clinical contact and the diagnostic of an IBC in our cohort and we were not\n\nable to assess the efficiency of the management of such patients using French guidelines  Once\n\nIBC is identified  it should be treated as an emergency  Our efforts should thus focus on cor-\n\nrectly identifying these patients at high risk of metastasis and progression  We have identified\n\nfactors strongly associated with IBC which would allow clinicians to diagnose IBC in women\n\npresenting with inflammatory breast syndrome \n\nConclusion\nIBC is prevalent in women presenting with non-puerperal inflammatory breast syndrome and\n\nshould be the major concern of clinicians managing these patients  Clinical and imaging exam-\n\nination may be helpful for this purpose but further investigation by breast biopsy should be\n\nundertaken if the slightest doubt remains  We are currently developing a nomogram based on\n\nour results to identifying these high-risk patients with an aim to accelerate appropriate man-\n\nagement in this emergency setting \n\nA non-puerperal inflammatory breast cohort\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0189385 December 20  2017 9 / 11\n\n\n\n\nSupporting

Ire-\nland that introduced a screening programme eight years apart  and to estimate the steady-\nstate mortality deficits the programme will produce  We carried out age- and year-matched\nbetween-region comparison of breast cancer mortality rates  and of incidence rates of stage\n2–4 breast cancer  in the eligible cohorts  The regions comprised counties that  beginning in\nearly 2000  region 1  and late 2007  region 2  invited women aged 50–64 to biennial mam-\nmography screening  The data were supplied by the National Cancer Registry  Central Sta-\ntistics Office  As impact measures  we used age-and-year-matched mortality  from breast\ncancers diagnosed from 2000 onwards  rate ratios and incidence rate ratios in the com-\npared regions from 2000 to 2013  Ratios were adjusted for between-region differences in\nbackground rates  In cohorts too old to be invited  death rates in regions 1 and 2 were 702\nper 0 91 and 727 per 0 90 million women-years respectively  Ratio 0 96  In the eligible\ncohorts  they were 1027 per 2 9 and 1095 per 2 67  Ratio 0 88  Thus  rates in cohorts that\ncould have benefitted were 9% lower in region 1 than region 2   95%CI  -20%  +4%  The\nincidence rates of stage 2–4 breast cancer were 7% lower in region 2 than region 1 over the\nentire 14 year period  and 20% lower in 2007  i e  before the screening in region 2 began to\nnarrow the difference  Since mortality reductions due to screening only manifest after sev-\neral years  the full impact of screening has not yet been realized in region 1  The lower rate\nobserved in that region is a conservative estimate of the steady state benefit  Additional\ndeaths would have been averted had screening continued beyond age 64 \n\nIntroduction\nUntil recently  mortality reductions in randomized trials carried out 20–40 years ago were the\n\nonly evidence for mammography screening  Since these trials  many countries have introduced\n\nmammography screening programmes  and ‘pre-post’ designs have been used to measure the\n\nchange in mortality rates following these programmes  Some of the downward temporal trends\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10

persons diagnosed with cancer in\n\nIreland  The use of these data for research is\n\ncovered by the Statutory Instrument which\n\nestablished the Registry Board in 1991  Data on\n\ncause of death was accessed via the NCRI under\n\nan agreement with the Office of the Registrar  Civil\n\nRegistration Service  All datasets were anonymised\n\nprior to analysis  As stated in the data release\n\npolicy stated on their website  https //www ncri ie/\n\ncontent/confidentiality  The National Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmay  however  have resulted from concomitant improvements in breast cancer management\n\nand treatment  A number of more complex designs  most commonly using a separate geo-\n\ngraphical area that did not introduce screening as a control  have been used to attempt to sepa-\n\nrate the effect of screening from the effect of improved treatment [1 2] \n\nUsing a ‘parallel’ design  a 2011 study [3] compared trends in mortality from breast cancer\n\nin three pairs of neighbouring European countries with similar population structures  socio-\n\neconomic characteristics and access to treatment but where one country implemented a\n\nscreening programme by 1990 with a later implementation in the matched country  It reported\n\nthat Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland had similar reductions in age-standardized\n\nbreast cancer mortality rates in the period 1989 to 2006  29% vs  26%  even though screening\n\nwas introduced in Northern Ireland in 1990 and only in the eastern region of the Republic of\n\nIreland in 2000  Unfortunately  the authors only had information on the age and year of death \n\nSince they did not use incidence-files  available from cancer registries  that would have pro-\n\nvided the year the cancer was diagnosed  their analysis included many deaths in women who\n\ncould not have benefitted from the screening programme introduced to the first of the pair of\n\ncountries  e g  those who by the age/year it began  were either too old  or had already been\n\ndiagnosed with breast cancer  Thus  by ignoring this first principle of cancer screening  their\n\nestimates of the benefit of the earlier introduction are greatly diluted \n\nWhat have come to be known as ‘incidence based’ mortality studies [4] avoid this bias by\n\nfocusing on the mortality from breast cancer diagnosed only after the first invitation to screen-\ning and excluding deaths in women who could not benefit from the screening program i e \nwhose cancers were diagnosed before screening was initiated  The term ‘incidence-based’ is a\n\ncontraction of the more informative “incidence-file based mortality” term introduced by Chu\n\net al  in 1994 [5]  The 2012 review of such studies  reported a breast cancer mortality reduction\n\nof 26%  95% confidence interval 13–36%  among women invited for screening and followed\n\nup for 6–11 years [6] \n\nA country with a phased rollout of screening provides the opportunity for a geographical\n\ncontrol group within the same country  Denmark and Norway are often referred to as ‘model\n\ncountries’ for this type of comparison with the first phase of screening in Denmark offered to\n\n20% of the target population in 1991–93 and a national rollout taking place between 2007 and\n\n2010 [1 2]  Norway commenced screening in four counties in 1995 with a gradual expansion\n\nto the remaining 15 counties by 2005 [7 8] \n\nThe Republic of Ireland has a more recent history of a phased rollout of mammography\n\nscreening with screening introduced in half of the country in 2000  Phase 1  in “Region 1’  and\n\nthe West and the South of the country only initiating screening at the end of 2007  Phase 2  in\n\n‘Region 2’  The program has two unusual features  screening is only until age 64  and the two\n\nregions involve similar sized populations  The primary objective of our study was to compare\n\nthe contemporary breast cancer death rates in the two regions using data from the Irish\n\nNational Cancer Registry on all breast cancer diagnoses since the first invitation to screening \n\nin women aged 50–85  while correcting for any difference in the contemporaneous ‘back-\n\nground’ rates between the geographic regions involved in the two phases  Although differences\n\nin mortality are the most trustworthy metric  the delay between when screening is carried out\n\nand when mortality reductions become evident is long and variable  A second objective was\n\ntherefore to use the incidence of stage 2–4 tumours  as a possible ‘leading indicator’ of the ulti-\n\nmate mortality reductions  Our third objective was methodological  we bring out the critical\n\nissue of ‘timing’ in any observed reductions in mortality or incidence of stage 2–4 tumours\n\n[9 10 11] by graphically representing the incidence rates and varying number of rounds of\n\nscreening invitations received over time by different birth cohorts  the graphs

graphical displays to remind readers of the prin-\n\nciples underlying cancer screening \n\nMethods\nBreastCheck–the Irish breast cancer screening programme\nFollowing a pilot programme in the Dublin Region [12]  the Republic of Ireland National\n\nBreast Screening Programme  BreastCheck  commenced in February 2000 for women aged 50\n\nto 64 in the East of the country covering about 50% of the eligible population  The programme\n\nis by invitation  by district electoral division and county  to all women in this age range every\n\ntwo years and is free of charge  Eleven of the 26 counties commenced the programme in 2000 \n\nfollowed by a further three counties from 2004–2006  The remaining twelve counties in the\n\nWest and South of the country commenced screening in December 2007  The target popula-\n\ntion acceptance rate of an invitation to screening has remained relatively stable over time rang-\n\ning from 68% to 76% of those invited [13] \n\nBreastCheck has offered a fully digitalised mammography service since 2008  Screening\n\nmammograms are taken in mobile digital screening units around the country or in dedicated\n\nunits attached to local hospitals  Two view mammograms are taken and independently\n\nassessed by two consultant radiologists  Programme standards are based on European and\n\nnational Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening[14 15] with radiolo-\n\ngists required to read a minimum of 5 000 screening cases per year and have specific training\n\nin mammography  Women with abnormal results are invited for further investigation at an\n\nassessment clinic in the nearest screening unit  These investigations may include a further\n\nmammogram  ultrasound or biopsy  Women diagnosed with breast cancer are then referred to\n\na multidisciplinary team \n\nThe Irish National Cancer Registry\nThe Irish National Cancer Registry began collecting data on all cancer diagnoses in the Repub-\n\nlic of Ireland in 1994  Tumour registration officers are based in hospitals around the country\n\nand actively register new diagnoses  Most cases are identified through histopathology reports\n\nbut the Registry also obtains records held in radiotherapy and oncology units  the hospital in-\n\npatient episodes  HIPE  database and death certificates  Death certificates are provided by the\n\nCentral Statistics Office \n\nCompleteness of case ascertainment by the Registry for breast cancer for women in the\n\nscreening age group of 50–64 is estimated to be greater than 99%  through independent case\n\nascertainment with BreastCheck records [16] \n\nData and contrasts\nWe used data from the National Cancer Registry on all women aged 50–85  diagnosed with\n\nbreast cancer from 2000 to 2013 and resident in the Republic of Ireland at the time of diagno-\n\nsis  The diagnoses were linked with death certificates with follow up to the end of 2013 to\n\nascertain date and cause of death \n\nBased on the county of residence at diagnosis  women were classified as having lived in\n\nRegion 1 which consisted of the eleven counties  mostly in the East  which began screening in\n\n2000 or

derived from data in the 2002 census at electoral divi-\n\nsion level  and applied to individual women by linkage of address [17]  Within each quintile \n\nwe also compared the age-standardised breast cancer mortality rates for the five years  1995–\n\n1999  before BreastCheck began \n\nAll deaths attributed to breast cancers diagnosed since the year 2000  at ages of 50–84  in\n\nwomen in these two regions are included in the analysis  representing 94% of all breast cancer\n\ndeaths in women aged 50–85 nationally in the time period of interest  The remaining 6% of\n\ndeaths occurred in the three counties who introduced screening in 2004–2006 \n\nThe tumour registry only began collecting data in 1994  so we could not use ‘historical’ con-\n\ntrol groups such as those used in the studies from Denmark or Norway  Instead  we used ‘par-\n\nallel’ control groups  and compared contemporary death rates in the two regions  but in\n\nwomen too old to benefit from a screening program limited to those aged 50–64 \n\nStatistical analysis\nAll graphics and calculations were custom-programmed in R  We used Lexis diagrams to display\n\nthe basic data and to illustrate and report the results of the contrasts  To address our first aim  we\n\ncarried out two  ‘invitation-to-screen’  between-region contrasts  one rate ratio measured the\n\namalgam of the effect of the earlier Region 1 screening and any inherent between-region differ-\n\nences in mortality rates even in the absence of screening  the other rate ratio measured just the\n\nregional difference in these ‘background’ mortality rates  caused by any regional differences in\n\nincidence or in quality of treatment  We then used the ‘double difference’  a ratio of rate ratios  to\n\nestimate the ‘net’ difference attributable to the earlier introduction of screening in Region 1 \n\nThus  the first contrast involved breast cancer mortality rates in the lower portion of the\nLexis diagrams  i e  among women who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer by the age\n\nof 50  or by the year 2000  and were aged between 50 and 64 at some time between 2000 and\n\nthe end of 2013  A summary Mantel-Haenszel rate ratio was computed using the 301 individ-\n\nual age-year cells as separate strata  and the variance of the log of this summary rate ratio was\n\ncomputed using the formula given in Breslow and Day [18]  Since the imbalances were mini-\n\nmal  the variance can be approximated as 1/D1 + 1/D0  where D1 and D0  are the overall num-\n\nbers of deaths in the compared regions  The rate ratio for the second contrast  along with the\n\nvariance of its log  was computed in the same way using the 203 cells in the upper portion of\nthe Lexis diagrams  i e  in the years lived by women aged 65 or older in 2000 who  likewise  had\n\nnot been diagnosed with breast cancer by then  but were too old to benefit from a screening\n\nprogram that only extended to age 64   Again  with 0 denoting the second contrast  the variance\n\nis well approximated by 1/D1\n0 + 1/D0\n\n0  Displayed ratios have been rounded to two decimal\n\nplaces  The variance of the log of the ratio of ratios  calculated as the sum of the two already-\n\ncomputed variances  was used to compute a confidence interval to accompany the point esti-\n\nmate of the ‘net’ reduction  This sum of variances is well approximated by the ‘Woolf-like’ for-\n\nmula  1/D1 + 1/D0 + 1/D1\n0 + 1/D0\n\n0  and shows that the width of the ultimate confidence\n\ninterval is determined by the smallest of the 4 counts \n\nWe also converted the  age-and-year-matched  double difference into an absolute number\n\nof deaths  so that the estimated number of invitations to avert one death from breast cancer\n\ncould be determined \n\nTo emphasize the time-patterns peculiar to cancer screening  and which ages in which\n\nyears would be affected by screening  we plotted the location  in calendar time  age  and ‘years\n\nsince last screening invitation’ of the numbers of deaths involved in each rate ratio in a sepa-\n\nrate figure  To bring out the patterns more clearly  we reduced the statistical noise by averaging\n\nthe numbers of deaths in adjacent cells of the Lexis diagram \n\nMortality reductions due to mammography screening  Contemporary population-based data\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188947 December 20  2017 4 / 14\n\n\n\n\nSince only about 70% of invitees participated  the resulting ‘invitation to screen’ reduction\n\nis an average of the maximal effect in these 70% and the null reduction in the 30%  If one\n\nassumed that  had they participated  the 30% would have benefited to the same extent as the\n\n70%  one can calculate that the reduction is approximately 100/70 = 1 4 times what is seen in\n\nthe ‘invitation to screen’ analysis  We also addressed this ‘efficacy’ measure  since it is the rele-\n\nvant number for women who plan to participate fully \n\nTo address our second and third objectives  we also used the between-region differences in\n\nincidence of stage 2–4 breast cancer as a ‘leading indicator’ of later mortality differences  The\n\nshorter lag between screening and the expected reductions in incidence—and the larger num-\n\nbers of ‘events’—allowed us to examine the time patterns in more detail than was possible with\n\nmortality \n\nWe analysed the patterns in two ways  First  we restricted the analysis to the 8 years 2000–\n\n2007  i e  before screening began in Region 2  We grouped the Lexis cells both by attained-age\n\nand by birth-cohort  and used Poisson regression and Joinpoint regression [19] to compute\n\nwithin-region annual changes in each of seven ‘bands’  each 5 years wide  Second  we examined\nthe between-region differences by computing 14 year-specific Mantel-Haenszel summary rate\nratios  each one matched on attained age  In addition  in order to obtain smooth-in-time rate\n\nratios  we used conditional Poisson regression  By fixing the total number of stage 2–4 cancers\n\nin an  age-at-diagnosis  year-of-diagnosis  Lexis cell  the number of them that arose from\n\nRegion 1 can be treated as a binomial random variable [20]  The Region1  Region2 split within\n\nthe cell is determined by the underlying ratio of the ‘background’ incidence rates in the two\n\nregions  the respective numbers of women-years they contribute  and the ‘net’ rate ratio–\n\nwhich itself can be modelled as constant-in or varying-in time [19] The rate ratio for cell  a y \n\nhas as its null value  unity  the rate of stage 2–4 tumours that  in the absence of a screening\n\nprogram  would have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 at age ‘a’ in year ‘y’  A ratio below unity indi-\n\ncates what fraction of these tumours would  despite the earlier invitations to screening  still\nhave been diagnosed at stage 2–4 at age ‘a’ in year ‘y’ at this same age/year  One minus this rate\n\nratio can thus be interpreted as the fraction of the initial ‘target’ that  as a result of the uptake\n\nof screening invitations  was detected in an earlier year—at stage 1 rather than at stage 2–4 \n\nBy way of orientation to the results  Fig 1 shows  for one selected birth cohort in Region 2 \n\nthe breast cancer deaths that a full screening program  i e  had it started in that region in 2000 \nmight have averted  Nine thousand women aged 54 residing in that region in 2000 only\nreceived their first  and last  invitation s  to screening at age s  62  and 64  Over the 14 years\n\nfrom the beginning of 2000 until the end of 2013  a fatal breast cancer shortened the lives of\n\nsome sixty six of these nine thousand women  some of these premature deaths  occurring\n\nbefore the women reached their late sixties  might have been averted had screening invitations\n\ncommenced at age 54  or 50  and moved the diagnosis and treatment to an earlier age/date \n\nResults\nThe insets in Fig 2 show a summary of deprivation and the extent of each region  The higher\n\nproportion in the least deprived quintile in region 1 are mostly resident in or close to the larg-\n\nest city  Dublin  However  there was no consistent relation between quintiles of deprivation\n\nand rates of breast cancer mortality from 1995–99  Moreover  age-standardized mortality rates\n\nin the two regions in these 5 years pre-BreastCheck were quite similar to each other \n\nThe main part of Fig 2 illustrates the numbers of screening invitations  ranging from none\n\nto seven  received by women in different birth-cohorts and Regions  In the age cohorts that\n\nwere too old to be invited to screening [thus serving as a check on the comparability of the\n\n‘background’ rates in two regions]  the death

attributed to the additional eight years of screening in Region\n1 is approximately 9%  95% confidence interval  a 20% reduction to a 4% increase \n\nIn absolute terms  the estimated number of deaths averted thus far by the additional eight years\nof screening  and 600 thousand more invitations to screening  if each invitation to one woman is\n\ncounted as a separate invitation  in Region 1 is approximately 9 percent of 1095  or 100 \n\nTo emphasize the complex time-patterns peculiar to cancer screening  and to highlight the\n\nage-window in which any additional mortality deficits generated by the planned extension of\n\nscreening to age 69 would manifest  Fig 3 shows the location  in calendar time  age  and ‘years\n\nsince last screening invitation’ of the numbers of deaths involved in each rate ratio  The small\n\nnumbers of deaths in the early years reflect the ‘incidence-based’ nature of the comparisons \n\nthese occurred only a few years after diagnosis  The age locations of the later deaths in the as-\n\nyet-largely-unscreened counties in Region 2 provide a guide to the ages  several years earlier \n\nat which screening-induced earlier treatment might have averted some of these deaths  Thus \nfor example  in the years 2010–2013 in Region 2  some 120 women died of breast cancer aged\n\n72–76  None of their cohorts had been invited to screening  In the corresponding years and\n\nages in region 1  some 116 died  the last invitation to their cohorts was when they were aged 64\n\ni e  8 to 12 years earlier  The data in Fig 3 can also be used to determine the age at which the\n\nlast screen would need to be to avert a portion of the still considerable numbers of deaths in\n\nwomen in their late 70s \n\nTable 1 shows the time-patterns in the incidence of stage 2–4 breast cancer over the first 8\n\nyears in each Region  In each of the 3 ‘horizontal’ and 4 ‘diagonal’ bands  the annual incidence\n\ndecreased in Region 1 and increased in Region 2  the results obtained by conventional Poisson\n\nregression and Joinpoint regression were identical \n\nOver all 14 years in the 301 Lexis cells that could have been affected by screening  there\n\nwere 5209 new cases of stage 2–4 breast cancer in the 2 90 million WY in Region 1  and 5117\n\nin the 2 67 million WY in Region 2  age-and year-matched Mantel-Haenszel rate ratio  0 94 \n\nAdjusted for the  background  1% higher Region-1 incidence in the 203 Lexis cells that could\n\nnot have been affected by screening  the stage 2–4 incidence rate in those women who could\n\nhave benefitted was thus 7% lower in Region 1 than Region 2  However  as is seen in Fig 4 \n\nthat 7% ‘deficit’ is a not very meaningful average of the 14 year-specific impacts of the earlier\n\nscreening in Region 1 than Region 2  The 20% Region1-Region2 difference in 2007 reflects the\n\n‘deficit’ of stage 2–4 cancers in Region 1 in that year  the number that–in the absence of screen-\n\ning would have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 in 2007—had already been detected at an earlier\n\nstage in screening rounds 1–3 held in 2000–2005  This a 20% deficit is a good estimate of the\n\nlong-term Region1-Region2 differences that would have been seen had Region 2 not begun\n\nscreening at all  The narrowing of the differences in the final 5 years reflects the later Region 2\n\nstart  as time progresses  the 2 curves will converge \n\nAlso included in the overall 7% difference is the higher rate of stage 2–4 cancers in Region 1\nrelative to Region 2 in the first 4 years  This also makes sense  Screening can detect stage 1 can-\n\ncers that would otherwise have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 in a later year  but each round of\n\nscreening  and especially the first few rounds  also detects stage 2–4 cancers that would other-\n\nwise have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 in a later year  A similar rise in the incidence of stage\n\n2–4 cancers is evident in Region 2 when screening began there \n\ncomparison limited

potential harmful effects such as over-diagnosis \n\nthose who fund organized mammography screening programs need to know how many future\n\nbreast cancer deaths will be averted by them  The best estimates of benefit are to be found in\n\nthe quasi-experimental data from contemporary population-based screening programs \n\nWhereas all ‘big data’ need to be analysed carefully  cancer screening data  whether from the\n\ntrials of decades ago or populations this millennium  need to be analysed even more carefully \n\nto take account of the delayed returns on investment and other time-dependent features that\n\nare peculiar to cancer screening  Thus  we made extensive use of graphical displays and sum-\n\nmarized the data using matching rather than modelling \n\nA synthesis in 2012 of the highest quality quasi-experimental studies–all based on inci-\n\ndence-based data—put the ‘best estimate’ of breast cancer mortality reduction produced by\n\nEuropean service mammography screening programmes at 26% [6]  One contribution to this\n\nestimate were the D1 = 223 and D1 = 438 breast cancer deaths in the 10 years after/before\n\nscreening was introduced to Copenhagen [1]  These two counts were the biggest component\n\nof the width of the confidence interval  D1 = 223  D0 = 2 333  D1\n0 = 438  D0\n\n0 = 2 123  Since the\n\nreview  two additional data points have been added  The data from Norway  with 1 175 deaths\n\nin the 4 to 14 years after screening was introduced in the different counties  yielded a point\n\nestimate of 28% with the width of the CI determined by D1 = 1 175 and D0 = 8 996 [6]  The\n\nother data point was from the Funen area of Denmark with an estimate of 22% based on the\n\n14 years after/before screening was introduced  D1 = 416  D0 = 566  D1\n0 = 4 246  D0\n\n0 = 4 111 \n\n[2] \n\nThe numbers of screening invitations issued to women in these areas followed the same pat-\n\ntern as on the left half of our Fig 2  No area had yet reached the steady state where every cohort\n\nhad been invited since age 50  up until age 69  and followed until the full benefits of these\n\nscreens–expected to be centred on the ages 55 to 75 or so–had been expressed  Thus the esti-\n\nmated reductions measure only a portion of what will be achieved in steady state  and each\n\nTable 1  For each region  attained-age- and birth-cohort-specific annual

difference\n\nbetween the regions involved in the two phases thus far be interpreted  The first difference is\n\nthat the close to 50 50 sample size ratio in the two regions makes for a small variance  D1 =\n\n1 027  D0 = 1 095 D1\n0 = 702  D0\n\n0 = 727  The second is that the correction in the double differ-\nence involves contemporary  post year 2000 only  rather than historical data  The closeness of\nthe background rates in the women who were too old for the screening program reduces the\n\nrisk of mixing mortality differences produced by screening and ones caused by regional differ-\n\nences in quality of care  Third  the Republic of Ireland is one of the few EU countries to have\n\nlimited screening to women aged 50–64  rather than to those aged 50–69 as recommended by\n\nthe Council of the European Union [21]  the program will now be extended to include all\n\nwomen from 50–69 by 2021 \n\nThe 9% regional difference seen thus far in Ireland measures how much of an advantage\n\nwomen in Region 1 have achieved thus far  i e  in the 14 years  over their Region 2 counter-\n\nparts  or their own counterfactuals  by having had access to organized screening almost 8 years\nsooner  The full effect in Region 1  when all cohorts have received all 8 invitations  from age 50\nto 64  could eventually be estimated indirectly if Region 2 had delayed its introduction  not for\n\n8  but for say 20–25 years  Given our inexact knowledge as to the timing of the delayed cancer\n\nscreening dividends  it is not possible to precisely extrapolate from the estimated 9% achieved\n\nthis far with a lead of 8 years  to an estimate based on a  hypothetical  phase 1 lead of 20–25\n\nyears  However  one might extrapolate from the differences seen with the 10 and 14 year leads\n\nin the two Danish studies  as long as one allows for the shorter ‘age-reach’ of the Irish program\n\n and its inability to avert most of the deaths that occur in women aged from the early 70s\n\nonwards  One should also allow for the initial phase 1 challenges in achieving full coverage\n\nand a 21–27 month cycle  Based on all of these considerations  it seems reasonable to project\n\nthat had the Region 1 lead been 20–25 years  their advantage over Region 2 in these years would\nhave been close to 20%–the remit of the program [13] \n\nWhen magnified by a factor of 100/70 so that it refers to the benefit of full participation in\n\nregion 1  the projection is closer to 30% \n\nThe observed 9% difference that drives these estimates might have been attenuated by the\n\nphase 1 start up challenges  and by greater opportunistic screening in Region 2—prompted by\n\nawareness of the program in Region 1  and paid for by private health insurance  But this is off-\n\nset by the possibly greater access to treatment in Region 1 pre 2008  when treatment pathways\n\nwere linked to the screening programme  Centres of clinical excellence for cancer treatment\n\nwere more common post 2008 \n\nIn addition to reporting the first 21st century-only screening data thus far  this paper high-\n\nlights an important but neglected principle in the analysis of cancer screening data  The effects\n\nof cancer screening are not like those of adult circumcision  where the resulting protection\n\nagainst HIV acquisition is immediate and lifelong  or one-time screening for abdominal aortic\n\naneurysms [22]  where the full benefits are already evident in year 2  and persist for at least a\n\ndecade  To estimate the full effects of this activity/intervention  a difference of a year or two\n\nbetween starting phase 1 and 2 would have been more than adequate  to directly see the full\n\nmortality effects of eight rounds of every second year screening  a lead of perhaps 20–25 years\n\nis necessary \n\nThe central role of timing and the difference in outlook between therapeutics and screening\n\nis further exemplified in the question of extending mammography screening from the ages of\n\n50–64 to 50–69  When considering the implications of the last screening invitation being at\n\nage 69 rather than at age 64  it is more instructive to work backwards  Suppose that  in the\nabsence of screening  a cancer had proved fatal at age 74  if there had been just one opportunity\nto screen for that cancer  at what age would it have been optimal to do so  What if there had\n\nMortality reductions due to mammography screening  Contemporary population-based data\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188947 December 20  2017 12 / 14\n\n\n\n\nbeen more than one  The patterns in Fig 2 and the raw data in Fig 3 illustrate why mortality\n\ndata related to cancer screening  whether derived from old trials or newer quasi-experimental\n\nstudies  need to be very carefully considered  Few analyses or meta-analyses to date have con-\n\nsidered these core screening questions  how long after the beginning of screening do the mor-\n\ntality deficits manifest themselves  How long after the cessation of screening do the mortality\n\ndeficits disappear  In each trial  how many rounds were there and how long was the follow-\n\nup  In light of these  what does a single average data from trials of varying screening duration\n\nand varying follow-up periods mean  And to whom does it apply \n\nThe reductions produced by cancer screening cannot be summarized using a single number\n\n the remit of the BreastCheck program was “reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20% in\n\nten years”  but must be arrayed in time along both of the dimensions used in these Figs  More-\n\nover  the cells must not be grouped merely by horizontal age-bands  as is commonly done \n\nWomen must also be followed  along the diagonals of the Lexis diagram  into subsequent age-\nbands  The good that screening at age 64 does only becomes apparent  as a mortality deficit  in\n\nsubsequent age bands  These principles should be used to interpret not just these latest data\nfrom Ireland  but all of the trial and population data to date \n\nReductions in the incidence of stage 2–4 tumours are not a prefect surrogate for the ulti-\n\nmate reduction in mortality  But the sharper and more immediate patterns are an important\n\nindicator  given that the gap between the two regions was only 8 years  Thus  the 20% ‘deficit’\n\nin incidence of these tumours in Region 1  just before Region 2 began screening  is an encour-\n\naging finding \n\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization  James A  Hanley  Ailish

for meta-\nstatic estrogen receptor  ER -positive and human epithermal growth factor 2  HER2 -nega-\ntive breast cancer  The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in\nTNBC cells  Retinoblastoma  RB  a known substrate of CDK4/6  pathway deregulation is a\nfrequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhi-\nbition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC mod-\nels  In addition  recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical\nefficacy in androgen-receptor  AR -positive TNBC cells  Here we examined the effect of pal-\nbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells \n\nMethod\nMDA-MB-453  BT-549  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were used for in\nvitro studies  Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot analysis  Cytostatic effect\nwas examined by MTT assay  Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry \n\nResults\nPalbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells  and enzalutamide inhibited\ncell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells  Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-\ninduced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells  In addition  palbociclib-medi-\nated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown

AR antagonists \n\nIntroduction\nTriple-negative breast cancer  TNBC  remains a challenging breast cancer subtype for its\n\nhigher risk of distant recurrence  and poorer outcome after recurrence or metastasis than\n\nother types of breast cancer [1–3]  Targeted therapy for TNBC is emerging in clinical trials and\n\nrecent molecular profiling studies have revealed molecular heterogeneity of TNBC [4] \n\nhighlighting the importance of finding biomarkers for targeted therapy guidance for TNBC \n\nPalbociclib is a highly selective cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6  CDK4/6  inhibitor \n\nwhich blocks the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein  pRB  and subsequently arrests\n\ncell cycle at G1-phase [5  6]  Previous study in vitro showed that palbociclib in combination\nwith hormone therapy  tamoxifen  or target therapy  trastuzumab  had an effectively inhibi-\n\ntory effect on ER-positive and HER2-amplified breast cancer  respectively [7]  In clinical  pal-\n\nbociclib in combination with letorzole  aromatase inhibitor  has been approved by the U S \n\nFood and Drug Administration  FDA  for the treatment of patients with ER-positive and\n\nHER2-negative advanced breast cancer [8  9]  However  the effects of palbociclib in TNBC are\n\nnot well-documented \n\nEnzalutamide  an androgen receptor antagonist  has been approved by the FDA for the\n\ntreatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer [10  11]  Cumulative evidences showed\n\nthat enzalutamide has potent anti-tumor effects on TNBC cells  and suggested that androgen\n\nreceptor  AR  might be a promising target for treatment of TNBC [12–14]  However  the effect\n\nof combination palbociclib with enzalutamide in TNBC cells is still unclear \n\nIn present study  we tested the combination effect of palbociclib with enzalutamide in\n\nTNBC cells  Cytostatic effects of enzalutamide  palbociclib or combined treatment and effects\n\nof treatments on AR and pRB proteins expressions were examined  Moreover  the influences\n\non cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were also evaluated \n\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and transfection\nHuman TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-453

with palbociclib enhances the cytostatic\neffect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells\nSince palbociclib is a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor  which blocks the phosphorylation of RB and\n\nsubsequently leads to inhibition of cell growth  we evaluated the effect of palbociclib in three\n\nTNBC cell lines  The result showed that palbociclib significantly inhibited the cell growth in RB-\n\nproficient cells  MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231  but not in RB-negative cells  MDA-MB-\n\n468   Fig 2A  Enzalutamide-suppressed cell viability of AR-positive cells is nearly 50%  Fig 2B \n\nTo examine whether enzalutamide enhanced palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect  we used 0 156\n\nor 2 5 μM palbociclib combined with various concentrations of enzalutamide in TNBC cell lines \nThe results revealed that enzalutamide enhanced the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-\n\npositive/RB-proficient  MDA-MB-453  cells rather than AR-positive/RB-negative  BT-549 \n\nAR-negative/RB-proficient  MDA-MB-231  AR-negative/RB-negative  MDA-MB-468  cells\n\nFig 2  Enzalutamide in combination with palbociclib enhances the cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells   A  MDA-MB-453  BT-\n549  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with various concentrations of palbociclib   B  enzalutamide and  C  combination of 0 156 or 2 5 μM\npalbociclib and 10 or 20 μM enzalutamide for 72 h  the cell viability was determined using MTT assay  The means ± SEM of three independent experiments\nperformed in triplicate are shown  *P   10%\n\nnuclear staining [32]  The level of RB1 mRNA correlated with level of pRB [33] and RB is\n\nreported that lost in ~40% of TNBC [34]  Furthermore  pRB level was found that lost in most\n\nTNBC by IHC analysis [35]  Studies have identified that luminal androgen receptor  LAR \n\nsubtype of TNBC cell lines might be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition [36  37]  Asghar et al  dem-\nonstrated that MFM223 and SUM185 cells were sensitive to palbociclib [37]  Indeed  these two\n\nLAR subtype cell lines harbored high level of pRB  The xenografts of LAR MDA-MB-453 cells\n\nwere significantly reduced by palbociclib treatment [37]  These findings supported AR positive\n\nand RB proficient TNBC were suitable for palbociclib treatment  In fact  a clinical trial of pal-\n\nbociclib in combination with bicalutamide  a non-steroidal AR inhibitor  for the treatment of\n\npatients with AR-positive TNBC is ongoing  ClinicalTrials gov Identifier  NCT02605486  In\n\nthe present study  palbociclib plus enzalutamide was found to effectively repress AR-positive/\n\nRB-proficient TNBC cell growth suggesting that co-expression of AR and RB might be a bio-\n\nmarker for combined treatment of palbociclib with enzalutamide in TNBC \n\nCurrent study has some limitation  first of all only four TNBC cell lines were used and there\n\nmight be other protein profile or mutants that can contribute to the differential effects of pal-\n\nbociclib and enzalutamide and combination in these cell lines  Furthermore  despite we\n\nshowed that knockdown RB attenuated palbociclib-mediated effect on AR+/RB+ MDA-MB-\n\n453 cells  the notion that combination effect of palbociclib and enzalutamide is most signifi-\n\ncant in AR+/RB+ MDA-MB-453 cells needs further mechanistic studies to validate that AR is\n\nessential for palbociclib-mediated cell cycle arrest in AR+/RB+ TNBC cells  Last but not the\n\nleast  our study is limited by lack of sufficient and consolidative clinical data to support the\n\npossible association between RB and AR  It is also not clear and inconclusive with regards to\n\nthe role of AR and RB expressions in TNBC tumors  More clinical studies are needed to\n\naddress or validate the biological association between AR and RB \n\nIn conclusion  we found that palbociclib effectively inhibited RB-proficient TNBC cell\n\ngrowth and the expression of AR might contribute for palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest  More-\n\nover  enzalutamide enhanced the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-pro-\n\nficient TNBC cells indicating that palbociclib in combination with enzalutamide may be a\n\ntherapeutic strategy for AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBCs \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  The relationships between AR gene expression and clinical variables  The level 3\ndata of mRNA RSEM

However  potential myocardial\ninduced by these 2 types of drugs not only affect the\nis of patients  but also limit their applications in\n] Myocardial damages caused by chemotherapy drugs\ned into

and creatine\nkinase-MB fraction levels [6 7] Among these  ECG has the best\ncost performance and is most commonly used  For patients with\nacute or subacute myocardial damage which usually caused by\nedema of myocardial cells and myocardial cell vacuolar\ndegeneration  the ECG manifested with nonspeciﬁc ST-T  ST\nsegment-T wave  alternations  lowing and ﬂatting of QRS wave\n QRS complex  and prolongation of QT interval  However  for\npatients with chronic myocardial damage  the changes in ECG\nsigns are transient and not easy to be captured [8–10] A simple\nECG detection cannot instantly reﬂect the degree of myocardial\ndamage in patients after chemotherapy  and commonly used\nclinical cardiac markers are lack of enough sensitivity and\nspeciﬁcity for detection [6 8]\n\nIschemia-modiﬁed albumin  IMA  is produced by human\nserum albumin  HSA  which local structure changed when it\nﬂows through ischemic tissues  Local tissues can produce\noxidative stress reaction when myocardial ischemia occurred \nand the N-terminal amino acid sequence of albumin was\noxidatively modiﬁed  which result in IMA formation  IMA\nconcentration rapidly increased in 5 to 10 minutes postmyo-\ncardial ischemia in peripheral blood  and sustained increase\nduring the course of ischemia  it would lasted for 2 to 4 hours \nand returned to baseline level in 6 to 10 hours [11

amplified in human breast cancer  \nhuman squamous cell lung cancer  and several other cancer types [1–3]  This amplicon is \ngenerally focal in nature  but has several discreet regions that can be amplified \nindependently of each other [4]  Accordingly  it is likely that this genomic region harbors \nseveral driving oncogenes  with at least one in each sub-region  Indeed  there are numerous \nreports in the literature documenting the transforming potential of at least six different genes \nfrom this amplicon [5–14]  For several years  our laboratory has been interested in the role \nplayed by one of these candidate oncogenes  the histone methyl transferase  NSD3  formerly \nknown as WHSC1L1  and we have published evidence for its amplification and \noverexpression in the SUM-44 human breast cancer cell line  primary human breast cancers  \nand its transforming function when overexpressed in MCF-10A cells  More recently  we \ndemonstrated that NSD3 can drive high level expression of ERa and induce estrogen-\nindependent  but estrogen receptor-dependent proliferation and survival of SUM-44 breast \ncancer cells [2  4  15  16]  These findings are consistent with data obtained by other labs that \nhave identified NSD3 as one of several genes in the amplicon that are associated with a poor \noutcome in ERa-positive breast cancer [6  17–22]  NSD3 has also been shown to have \ntransforming ability in other model systems  and has been implicated as a driving oncogene \nby GISTIC analysis of large datasets derived from human breast cancer specimens [23]  \nThus  there is a significant body of literature supporting the notion that NSD3 is an \nimportant oncogene in breast and other cancers in which the 8p11 region is focally \namplified  However  because of the complexity of this genomic region  and because FGFR1 \nis a neighboring gene on the amplicon that is almost always co-amplified and overexpressed \nwith NSD3  the oncogenic role of NSD3 in human breast cancer has not yet been widely \naccepted [24]  To investigate further the potential of NSD3 to act as a breast cancer \noncogene  we developed a transgenic mouse model with targeted expression of NSD3 to the \nmammary epithelium  In this report  we demonstrate that NSD3 transgenic FVB mice \nexhibit altered mammary gland morphology during development  differentiation  and \ninvolution  resulting in a profound lactation defect caused by the failure of the alveoli to \nundergo full functional differentiation  By 40 weeks of age  many of these mice developed \nmammary gland hyperplasias  dysplasias  carcinoma in situ  and mammary carcinomas  \nThus  these results extend our in vitro results and show that targeted expression of NSD3 to \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page

methods\nChemicals and antibodies\n\nAll reagents used for carmine staining of whole mounts  including ethanol  xylene  and \nglacial acetic acid  were purchased from Fisher Scientific  Hampton  NH  unless stated \notherwise  The NSD3 antibody used for western blotting and immunostaining was \npurchased from ProteinTech Group Inc   Cat  No  11345-1-AP  and the ERa antibody was \npurchased from Santa Cruz  Cat  No  sc-7207  Primers used for genotyping were purchased \nfrom IDT \n\nTransgenic mice\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee  IACUC  at the Medical University of SC \n MUSC  approved all animal experiments  AR#3397  For the purposes of this study  \nFVB/N mice were used to generate NSD3 and KAT6A transgenic mouse colonies  The \ninbred FVB/N strain is commonly used for the production of transgenic mice  as they \nproduce large litters and their large pronuclei can withstand microinjection of the transgene  \nMale and female WT FVB/N mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories  Bar Harbor  \nME  and bred under typical conditions with unlimited access to food and water  Targeted \nexpression of NSD3 and KAT6A to the mammary gland was achieved by cloning each \ntransgene into the MKbpAII vector with an MMTV promoter  Cloning and preparation of \nNSD3 and KAT6A constructs as well as generation of transgenic mice was performed by the \nGene Function Core at MUSC following the standard protocol for production of transgenic \nmice \n\nNSD3 and KAT6A genotyping\nTo identify positive transgenic pups  tail snips were obtained from 3 week-old pups before \nweaning  Tails were incubated overnight at 55 °C in digestion buffer and DNA was purified \nusing the ZR Genomic DNA™ Mini Prep Kit  Zymo Research  Irvine  CA  Genotyping by \nPCR was performed with the following primers  NSD3 For  5′-\nATACTCTGAGTCCAAACCGGG-3′ and NSD3 Rev  5′-GTGTGAGCGCTCTTCAG-3′  \nKAT6A For  5′-GGGGCAAAGTTTGGGTG-3′ and KAT6A Rev  5′-\nCAGGATGGATGGCCACTGTT-3′  PCR

 Virgin mammary glands were \nharvested at 12 weeks of age and mammary glands of females at mid-pregnancy were \nharvested between day 12 and 14 post-mating  Lactating mammary glands were taken 7–10 \ndays following the birth of litters  and at least 2 weeks were allowed for involution to occur \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 3\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 May

spread on microscope \nslides  Polysine pre-cleaned microscope slides  Thermo Scientific  MA  and prepared for \ncarmine staining  Briefly  once the glands adhered to the slide  approximately 1–2 min  they \nwere fixed in 100% ethanol/30% acetic acid  3 1  at room temperature overnight  The \nfollowing day  slides were washed in 70% ethanol for 15 min  then in distilled water for 5 \nmin  The glands were then stained overnight with carmine alum [1 g Carmine  Sigma-\nAldrich C-6125  2 5 g Aluminum potassium sulfate  Sigma-Aldrich C-237 086  in 500 ml \nwater]  The tissues were then washed in 75  95  and 100% ethanol for 15 min each and \ncleared in xylene overnight  For long-term storage  whole mounts were stored in methyl \nsalicylate  Sigma-Aldrich  St  Louis  MO  Tumors harvested from NSD3 transgenic females \nwere cleanly excised and fixed in formalin overnight \n\nTissue processing and staining\nWhole mounts and tumors were processed by the Biorepository and Tissue Analysis

biotinylated secondary \nantibody  Vector  CA  USA  for 30 min and ABC reagent  Vector  CA USA  for 30 min  \nImmunocomplexes were visualized by DAB  Dako  Glostrup  Denmark  reaction and \nsections were counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting \n\nResults\nDelayed development in pups from NSD3 transgenic female mice\n\nTo further our studies on the oncogenic role of the breast cancer candidate oncogene NSD3  \nwe generated a transgenic mouse line in which NSD3 expression was targeted to the \nmammary gland  To identify potentially positive transgenic pups  tail biopsies were taken \nfrom 2 week-old mice and PCR was performed to detect the transgene  thereby identifying \nfounder  F0  mice  Once founder mice were of breeding age  both male and female F0 mice \nwere mated with wild-type  WT  FVB/N mice to establish F1 offspring \n\nThe first goal of these experiments was to determine if targeted expression of NSD3 in the \nmammary gland would have observable effects on mammary gland biology through the \nnormal growth  differentiation  and involution cycle of the mouse mammary gland  Early on \nin our observations  we noticed that pups born to NSD3 transgenic female mice were \nunderdeveloped  By contrast  pups born to WT females mated with NSD3 transgenic males \ndid not display any developmental defects  Fig  1  This was readily apparent at day 9  at \nwhich point pups nursed by NSD3 transgenic females were not only significantly smaller \nthan pups born to wild-type mothers  but also showed delayed hair growth and eye opening \ncompared to pups nursed by WT females  However  pups born to WT females mated with \nNSD3 transgenic males and nursed by WT females did not display this developmental lag  \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 4\n\nBreast Cancer Res

developmental lag displayed in pups nursed by NSD3 transgenic females was \nevident in both WT and NSD3 transgenic pups  giving the first indication that this \ndevelopmental delay was due to a lactation defect present in the NSD3 transgenic females \nand not a result of NSD3 expression in the pups \n\nLactation deficiency in NSD3 transgenic females\nTo further investigate the influence of mammary gland-targeted expression of NSD3 on \nmammary gland biology  mammary glands from virgin  mid-pregnant  lactating  and post-\nlactating mice were harvested for whole mount and histologic analysis  As seen in Fig  2a  \nmammary glands from 12 week-old virgin transgenic females displayed increased ductal \nbranching and terminal bud formation compared to WT female virgins  Additionally  \nmammary glands taken from NSD3 transgenic females mid-pregnancy  12–14 days  Fig  2b  \nshowed more numerous and densely packed alveolar buds compared to WT females during \npregnancy  Although these phenotypes were subtle  blind scoring of these mammary gland \nwhole mounts identified mammary glands from transgenic mice 100% of the time  The \nphenotypic differences between mammary glands from lactating transgenic females versus \nwild-type mice were not subtle and were consistent with the lactation defect hypothesized \nbased on the growth of the pups as described above  Mammary glands from lactating \ntransgenic mice showed evidence of gross defects in the full functional differentiation of \nmany of the alveoli in these mammary glands  Fig  2c  This failure to achieve full \nfunctional differentiation was observed in every lactation-state mammary gland we observed \nin transgenic females  and is consistent with the growth retardation observed in the pups of \nthese mice  In addition  examination of post-lactation mammary glands from wild-type and \ntransgenic mice showed that while post-lactation mammary glands from WT female mice \nhad undergone involution  glands from transgenic females failed to completely involute and \nshowed evidence of hyperplasia  Fig  2d \n\nMammary hyperplasia  dysplasia  and tumorigenesis in NSD3 transgenic females\nTo examine the long-term effects of mammary gland-targeted expression of NSD3  a group \nof 25 transgenic and wild-type females were maintained until they reached one year of age \nand monitored weekly for tumor development  We first palpated mammary tumors in two \ntransgenic mice at 40 weeks of age  and thereafter  several additional transgenic parous \nfemales developed mammary tumors at ages between 40 and 50 weeks  Overall  five of the \n25 transgenic mice  all of which were parous females  developed mammary tumors  By \ncontrast  none of the WT mice developed tumors or any other morphologic abnormalities  \nOnce tumors reached a size of 1 cm3  the mice were euthanized and the tumors were excised \nand fixed in formalin for histological analysis  At the same time  the remaining mammary \nglands were harvested from tumor-bearing females and whole mounts were prepared  \nInterestingly  mammary glands from tumor-bearing mice exhibited numerous ductal and \nalveolar hyperplasias and ductal dysplasias  Fig  3  Histological analysis of these mammary \nlesions revealed a wide variety of abnormalities including areas that would be identified as \nproliferative and non-proliferative fibrocystic disease in humans  such as alveolar and ductal \nhyperplasia  adenosis  microcyst formation  and columnar cell change  Papillary lesions \nwere also identified  In addition  areas of epithelial atypia  dysplasia  and ductal carcinoma \nin situ  DCIS  were commonly observed  Patterns of DCIS were similar to those seen in \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 5\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat

identifiable micropapillary  cribriform  and clinging-type carcinoma  Patterns \nof invasive carcinoma markedly resembled that seen in high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma \nin humans with often solid or trabecular type growth patterns that exhibit a high mitotic rate \nand increasing degrees of necrosis as the tumors increased in size  No lesions or tumors were \nobserved in mammary glands of age-matched wild-type female mice  consistent with \npublished reports on the background incidence of mammary tumors in FVB mice  A total of \nfive of the 25 transgenic mice followed to 50 weeks of age developed frank mammary \ntumors  All of these mice also exhibited areas of mammary hyperplasia  dysplasia  and \ncarcinoma in situ in other mammary glands  In addition  three mice that did not develop \npalpable tumors during this time exhibited mammary hyperplasias and dysplasias  In all  95 \nmammary glands from the 25 mice were examined  with structural abnormalities identified \nin 18 of the 95 whole mounts  Fig  4 \n\nIt is noteworthy that in the course of these studies  we also generated KATA6A  Myst3  \ntransgenic mice  as we have previously implicated this gene from the 8p11-p12 region as a \nbreast cancer oncogene [14]  In contrast to the results obtained with the NSD3 transgenic \nmice  KATA6 mice did not exhibit any altered morphologic phenotypes or lactation defects  \nand never developed mammary pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions \n\nTo confirm transgene overexpression in the mammary glands of transgenic mice-bearing \ntumors or hyperplasias/dysplasias  immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the \nhistological sections from these mammary glands  Figure 5a shows that indeed  these \nmammary gland lesions and tumors stained positively for NSD3  as well as ERa  consistent \nwith our recently published association between NSD3 and ER expression in human breast \ncancer cell lines [16]  Finally  when tumors were harvested from transgenic female mice  \npieces of the tumor were subjected to enzymatic dissociation and plated into primary \nculture  After one to two weeks in culture  cells were harvested and assessed for expression \nof NSD3 by western blot analysis  Figure 5b confirms that these mouse mammary tumor \ncells express high levels of NSD3 protein \n\nIn summary  these studies demonstrate the oncogenic potential of NSD3 when expression is \ntargeted to the mammary gland of FVB mice and support the hypothesis that NSD3 is a \ndriving breast cancer oncogene from the 8p11 amplicon \n\nDiscussion\n8p11-p12 amplification is associated with poor survival and distant recurrence in luminal \nbreast cancer [1  3  4  17]  We and others have shown that overexpression of several genes \nwithin the 8p11-p12 region can provide a pathological gain-of-function to breast cells [15  \n16  22]  Within focal regions of gene amplification  it is often difficult to determine which \ngenes are most important and act as driving genes  Driving genes provide a necessary \ngrowth advantage that is essential for tumor survival  whereas while passenger genes are \noften amplified with driving genes  they are not necessary for proliferation or survival  \nPrevious published data are consistent with the notion that the 8p11-p12 amplicon contains \nboth driver and passenger genes  and studies from other laboratories have proposed different \ndrivers [2  4  15  25  26]  Predictions based on Cancer Genome Atlas data  including GISTIC \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 6\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat  Author manuscript  available

putative 8p11 amplicon driving genes  and \nhave identified NSD3 as a driving gene in multiple tumor types  including breast cancer \n[23]  In the present study  we demonstrated that targeted expression of NSD3 in the \nmammary epithelium of FVB mice resulted in drastic morphological alterations in the \nmammary gland  inhibited functional differentiation  and resulted in the development of \nhyperplasias  dysplasias  carcinoma in situ  and mammary carcinoma development \n\nWe first observed that targeted expression of NSD3 to the mammary epithelium blocked \nfunctional differentiation of the alveolar units in the mammary gland resulting in stunted \ndevelopmental growth of the offspring when compared to pups born to WT females  The \ndevelopmental lag was evident by postpartum day 9  pups nursed by NSD3 females had \ndelayed hair growth compared to pups nursed by WT females  This phenotype persisted \nthrough weaning age  resulting in significantly smaller NSD3 transgenic female-nursed \npups  In contrast  pups nursed by WT females displayed normal developmental patterns  \nInterestingly  the developmental lag was evident in all pups nursed by NSD3 transgenic \nfemales regardless of the genotype of the pups  Indeed  carmine staining of mammary glands \nfrom lactating NSD3 transgenic females showed areas where alveoli had failed to undergo \nfull functional differentiation \n\nIn addition to the lactation deficiency seen in NSD3 females  these mice developed \nmammary gland hyperplasias  dysplasias  and carcinomas  Tumors from NSD3 transgenic \nfemales presented as infiltrating ductal carcinomas with high nuclear grade  These tumors \nwere not well circumscribed and displayed irregular borders  The phenotypes of these mouse \nmammary carcinomas are significant because they are similar to the phenotypic \ncharacteristics observed in human breast cancers  Furthermore  the majority of glands in \ntumor-bearing NSD3 transgenic females showed areas of hyperplasia  dysplasia  and \ncarcinoma in situ \n\nConclusions\nPrevious studies from our lab and others have demonstrated the potent transforming \nproperties of NSD3  which is consistent with its role as an important driving oncogene on \nthe 8p11-p12 amplicon [15  16  22]  Here  we provide direct evidence for NSD3 as a breast \ncancer oncogene by showing that targeted expression of NSD3 in the mouse mammary \ngland prevents alveolar differentiation and results in development of pre-malignant lesions \nand mammary gland ductal carcinomas  At the present time  the only clinical studies that \nhave been performed in patients exhibiting the 8p11 amplicon have focused on targeting the \nFGFR1 gene  which is present on the amplicon and is often co-amplified with NSD3  The \nresults of these clinical studies have been disappointing in both breast and lung cancer \npatients bearing the amplicon [27  28]  These clinical findings suggest that FGFR1 is not a \nmajor driving oncogene in 8p11 amplified breast and lung cancers  Thus  it is now important \nto consider NSD3 as an important driving oncogene and a potential druggable target in \nbreast cancer patients  and perhaps lung cancer patients  bearing the 8p11 amplicon and \nexhibiting amplification and overexpression of NSD3 \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 7\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat  Author

BRCA2  gene mutations can identify \nwomen at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer  These testing results can be used to select preventive interventions and guide \ntreatment  Differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive \ninterventions after testing have not previously been examined  \nPeriod Covered  2009–2014 \nDescription of System  Medical claims data from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters \ndatabases were used to estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA testing among women \naged 18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States  \nboth nationally and regionally \nResults  From 2009 to 2014  BRCA testing rates per 100 000 women aged 18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance \nincreased 2 3 times  102 7 to 237 8  in metropolitan areas and 3 0 times  64 8 to 191 3  in nonmetropolitan areas  The relative \ndifference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37% in 2009  102 7 versus 64 8  \nto 20% in 2014  237 8 versus 191 3  The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan \nareas decreased more over time in younger women than in older women and decreased in all regions except the West  Receipt of \npreventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service  \nthe percentage of women who received a mastectomy was similar  the percentage of women who received magnetic resonance \nimaging of the breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas  as low as 5 8% in 2014 to as high as 8 2% in 2011  than metropolitan \nareas  as low as 7 3% in 2014 to as high as 10 3% in 2011  and the percentage of women who received mammography was lower \nin nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was similar in later years \n\nInterpretation  Possible explanations for the 47% decrease \nin the relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the \nstudy period include increased access to genetic services in \nnonmetropolitan areas and increased demand nationally as \na result of publicity  The relative differences in metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were smaller among \nwomen at younger ages compared with older ages \n\nCorresponding author  Katherine Kolor  Office of Public Health \nGenomics  Division of Public Health Information Dissemination

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPublic Health Action  Improved data sources and surveillance tools are needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA testing in \nthe United States  monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for BRCA testing  and assess receipt of preventive interventions \nfor women with BRCA mutations  Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic disparities in receipt of BRCA testing \nwhile simultaneously educating the public and health care providers about U S  Preventive Services Task Force recommendations \nand other clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and counseling \n\nIntroduction\nGenetic mutations in the breast cancer 1  BRCA1  and \n\nbreast cancer 2  BRCA2  genes can increase breast cancer risk \nin women by age 70 years from 7% to an estimated 45%–65% \nand can increase ovarian cancer risk by age 70 years from 0 6% \nto 17%–39%  1 2  Genetic testing based on personal and \nfamily health history criteria can identify women with BRCA \nmutations who could benefit from preventive interventions \nthat can decrease cancer risk  BRCA testing for women who \nhave received these cancer diagnoses can be used to make \nsurgical and drug treatment decisions  3 4   \n\nInterventions for women with BRCA mutations for cancer \nprevention and earlier detection include enhanced screening \n e g  receiving mammograms at a younger age and more \nfrequently than lower risk women along with magnetic \nresonance imaging [MRI]  risk-reducing medications such \nas tamoxifen or raloxifene  and prophylactic surgery to \nremove the breasts  ovaries  or both  Prophylactic mastectomy \ncan reduce the risk for breast cancer by 85%–100%  and \nprophylactic oophorectomy can reduce the risk for ovarian \ncancer by 69%–100% and breast cancer by 37%–100%  1  \nFor women who have breast cancer  prophylactic contralateral \nmastectomy might be offered as an option to reduce the risk for \ncontralateral breast cancers  5  BRCA testing is approved by \nthe Food and Drug Administration as a companion diagnostic \ntool to guide treatment with poly ADP-ribose  polymerase \n PARP  inhibitors among women with ovarian cancer who \nhave already undergone multiple lines of chemotherapy  6 7  \nPhase III clinical trials have reported promising results for the \nPARP inhibitor olaparib as a treatment for breast cancer in \nwomen with BRCA mutations  8  \n\nSeveral clinical guidelines are available to help specialty and \nprimary care providers to determine whether BRCA genetic \ncounseling and testing is appropriate for their patients  \nThe 2013 U S  Preventive Services Task Force  USPSTF  \nBRCA guideline recommends that primary care providers \nassess women for increased risk for BRCA mutations using \nfamily health history to identify women who might benefit \nfrom genetic counseling  1  The National Comprehensive \nCancer Network  NCCN  guidelines specify family and \npersonal history criteria that warrant additional genetic \nrisk assessments  3  In addition  the USPSTF and NCCN \n\nguidelines review preventive interventions for women \nidentified with BRCA mutations  When a BRCA mutation is \nidentified  other family members can be tested for the known \nmutation  i e  cascade testing  to identify others at increased \nrisk for cancer  1 3  A Healthy People 2020 objective is to \nincrease rates of genetic counseling for women with a family \nhealth history indicating an increased risk for breast or ovarian \ncancers  9  BRCA genetic counseling and testing are usually \ncovered  in network without cost sharing  by most health \ninsurance plans as preventive services when used in accordance \nwith USPSTF recommendations  10 \n\nBRCA testing guidelines generally recommend both pretest \nand posttest genetic counseling by a trained health care provider \n 1 11  As of 2016  approximately 5 000 genetic counselors \nwere practicing in the United States  12  The geographic \ndistribution of genetic service providers has historically been \nuneven  with a concentration in urban areas and academic \nmedical centers  However  a 2016 survey of genetic counselors \nfound that nearly half reported serving smaller  more rural \npopulations  12  Alternative genetic services delivery models  \nsuch as telephone counseling  13  outreach clinic services \n 14  and telemedicine genetic services  15–17  are being \nincorporated by genetic counselors to complement in-person \ncounseling and to help improve overall access to care  e g  in \nrural areas  In addition  genetic services  such as BRCA genetic \ncounseling and testing  are being offered by specialists who \nare not geneticists  including oncologists and obstetrician-\ngynecologists  18 19 \n\nA comparison of changes over time in BRCA testing rates \nand receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA testing in \nurban and rural areas at the national and regional levels could \nhelp to document the evolution of differences in service use  \nHowever  the available data for monitoring BRCA testing in the \nU S  population and its subgroups are limited  For example  \nclaims data can be used to assess use of health services  and \nspecific billing codes for BRCA testing have been available since \n2001  20  However  BRCA test billing codes have changed \nover time  and before 2013  nonspecific billing codes were also \nused for BRCA testing  which hinders complete ascertainment \nof these tests from claims data  21  Furthermore  numerous \nfactors might influence variations in BRCA test use in the \nUnited States  For example  a substantial increase in BRCA \ntesting occurred in 2013 after publication of a celebrity’s \n\n\n\nSurveillance Summaries\n\nMMWR / September 8  2017 / Vol  66 / No  15 3US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\neditorial describing

direct-to-consumer advertising \ncampaign that was intended to raise awareness about BRCA \ntesting among women with a personal or family history of \nbreast or ovarian cancer  24  Racial/ethnic disparities in rates \nof BRCA testing and follow-up preventive services have been \nreported  25  attributed in part to socioeconomic factors and \nphysician referral patterns  26 \n\nTo examine differences over time and by census region in \nBRCA testing rates in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas \nin the United States  this report analyzes health claims data \nfrom the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial \nClaims and Encounters  CCAE  databases  This report presents \nrates of BRCA testing  for any reason other than testing for \nknown Ashkenazi mutations  from 2009 to 2014 among \nwomen aged 18–64 years  In addition  this report describes \nreceipt of preventive services  i e  mammography  breast MRI  \nand mastectomy  and genetic counseling among women who \nhad BRCA tests  These findings can be used by public health \nofficials and practitioners to better understand differences \nin the implementation of genomic medicine applications in \nmetropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas and identify areas of \npotential need and growth \n\nMethods\nMedical claims data from 2009 to 2014 for women aged \n\n18–64 years were extracted from Truven Health Analytics \nMarketScan CCAE databases  27  a proprietary data system \nintegrating information from inpatient services  outpatient \nservices  including laboratory tests  and outpatient pharmacies \nprovided by a nationwide convenience sample of employers \nand employer-sponsored commercial insurance plans that \ncover employees and their dependents  The MarketScan \nCCAE databases contain enrollment data and longitudinally \nlinked health care use and expenditure data  MarketScan \nclaims and patient-level information  including age  sex  \ngeographic location  diagnostic codes  and procedure codes  \nwere analyzed  Both partial-year and full-year enrollees \nwere included  Residential status  nonmetropolitan and \nmetropolitan  of enrollees was mapped from the five-digit zip \ncode of the

The residential status of women \nwho changed their status  i e  from nonmetropolitan to \n\nmetropolitan or the reverse  was determined by where they \nlived the most months during that year \n\nReceipt of both preventive-associated and treatment-\nassociated BRCA testing was ascertained from outpatient \nand inpatient claims  Claims of BRCA testing were extracted \nusing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System \n HCPCS  codes  S3818–S3823  and Current Procedural \nTerminology  CPT  codes  81211–81217  Four subtypes \nof BRCA tests were defined based on billing codes  full-gene \nsequencing  known mutation tests  Ashkenazi panel  and large \nrearrangement tests  which are typically done at the same \ntime as or after full-gene sequencing tests  Women who had \nBRCA panel tests for Ashkenazi mutations were excluded \nfrom the final analyses of BRCA testing rates to avoid inflating \ndifferences between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas \nbecause almost all Ashkenazi panel testing was concentrated \nin metropolitan areas  Women who had Ashkenazi panel \ntesting accounted for approximately 5% of women who had \nany BRCA testing during the study period and ≤0 1% of all \nwomen aged 18–64 years  When calculating BRCA testing \nrates  women who had Ashkenazi panel tests were excluded \nfrom the numerator   However  the data contain no measure \nof ethnicity that could be used to exclude women of Ashkenazi \nancestry from the denominator  \n\nThe annual calendar-year receipt rates of any BRCA test and \nsubtypes were calculated as follows  the number of women \nenrollees aged 18–64 years who had at least one claim in \nthe calendar year that contained one of the BRCA testing \nprocedure codes divided by the total number of women aged \n18–64 years enrolled at any point during that year  multiplied \nby 100 000  For each study year  enrollee age was defined as \nthe age on January 1  or at the start of enrollment period for \npartial-year enrollees  Rates also were calculated by age group \n 18–34  35–44  45–54  and 55–64 years  and by U S  census \nregion  Northeast  Midwest  South  and West   28  Adjusting \nBRCA

genetic service providers  The lower rate also might reflect \ngeneral factors such as poverty  lower educational attainment  \nand lack of health insurance  which have previously been \nimplicated in health care and preventive service access disparities \nin urban and rural areas  30  Although significant differences \nwere found in the sample age distribution between metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas  adjusting the BRCA testing rates by \nage did not change the general findings or conclusions \n\nBRCA mutations are found in all racial/ethnic groups  \nhowever  certain populations  notably Ashkenazi Jews  have \nboth higher frequencies of specific BRCA mutations and are \nconcentrated in metropolitan areas  which might therefore \ndifferentially affect metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA \ntesting rates  In this study  women who received BRCA testing for \nAshkenazi mutations were excluded to minimize potential bias \n\nThe decreased disparity in testing rates between metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas from 2009 to 2014 could reflect a \ndecreasing reliance on specialists for genetic testing for BRCA   \nIn 2013  the USPSTF recommendation stated that trained \nhealth professionals  including primary care providers  could \nprovide genetic counseling about BRCA mutation testing to \nidentify women deemed to be at risk for BRCA mutations based \non family history  1  Because small proportions of women \nwho received genetic testing for BRCA had claims for genetic \ncounseling throughout the period  both in metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas  differences in access to genetic \ncounseling services are unlikely to have been an important \nfactor  however  genetic counseling billing codes might not \ninclude all instances of counseling services  31 32 \n\nFinally  the coverage of BRCA counseling and testing under \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  ACA  when \nthese services are provided in accordance with USPSTF

during the study period  Although \nthe ACA provision that requires many health plans to \npromote in-network coverage without cost sharing for certain \nUSPSTF-recommended services became effective in September \n2010  a clarification issued in February 2013 might have \nincreased testing  along with other factors discussed  22–24  \nThis additional guidance specified that BRCA testing and \ncounseling  if determined appropriate by a woman’s health care \nprovider  is covered as a preventive service  10  A recent study \nshowed that in the 2 years after the 2013 ACA clarification  \nthe percentage of women with no out-of-pocket expenses \nincreased  33 \n\nThe relative difference in testing rates between metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas generally decreased over the study \nperiod across all age groups but decreased most among women \naged 18–34 years and least among women aged 55–64 years  \nWomen aged 18–34 years had the highest relative growth \nin BRCA testing compared with older age groups for both \nmetropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas  Younger persons \nmight adopt the use of newer health care services more \nquickly  and access to services might present less of a barrier for \nyounger than for older age groups  34  The regional analyses \n\ndemonstrated that national increases in BRCA testing can mask \nimportant differences in population subgroups  For example  in \nthe West  BRCA testing increased more over the study period \nin metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas  unlike \nthe other regions examined  This might indicate that the West \nhas unique challenges in reaching nonmetropolitan areas with \nBRCA testing \n\nAmong women with BRCA mutations  lower receipt of \npreventive services such as MRI in nonmetropolitan areas \ncould reflect barriers to access  lower risk for having a BRCA \nmutation among those tested  or a higher proportion of BRCA \ntesting performed based on family health history compared \nwith personal history of cancer  The percentage of women \nwho received a mastectomy or an MRI after BRCA testing \npeaked in 2011 both in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan \nareas  the decreasing percentages observed from 2012 to 2014 \ncould reflect a shift over time toward a higher proportion of \nBRCA testing done based on family health history compared \nwith personal history of cancer  35  The percentage of women \nwho received a mastectomy was similar in metropolitan and \nnonmetropolitan regions within 90 days and 1 year after BRCA \ntesting  however  a longer follow-up period might

specific to BRCA testing  Claims data also might \nbe subject to recording errors or adjudication errors  and the \nreliability of the coding of BRCA tests might have changed over \ntime  These factors might have affected the completeness of \nascertainment of BRCA tests  particularly before 2013  21 41  \nThird  the OMB metropolitan-nonmetropolitan classification \nscheme is an imperfect proxy for rural-urban classification for \nseveral reasons  For example  large metropolitan areas might \ncontain rural areas that might be far from an urban center  \nwhich might reduce the overall rates of BRCA testing observed \nin metropolitan areas and present an incomplete assessment of \nBRCA testing in nonmetropolitan areas due to misclassification  \nIn addition  residence in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan \narea was determined by the primary beneficiary  who might \nhave lived in a different area than the woman who received \nthe test  e g  young women who were on a parent health \ninsurance plan but did not live with the parent and spouses \nwho were on the same insurance plan but lived in different \nstates  Residence in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area \nmight have changed at the time of BRCA testing and might \nalso have changed for multiyear enrollees  Among women who \nhad BRCA testing  <1% had testing over multiple years  and \n<1% of those changed residential status  Fourth  the outcomes \nof BRCA tests and whether women met current BRCA testing \nguidelines could not be determined from medical claims data  \nTherefore  determining whether the lower levels of testing in \nnonmetropolitan areas represented proportionately lower use \nof appropriate testing compared to metropolitan areas was \nnot possible  Finally  the billing codes used to identify genetic \ncounseling services were expected to identify only a fraction \nof women who received genetic counseling because genetic \ncounseling is often billed under evaluation and management \ncodes when attended by a physician  31 32  and counseling \nmight be provided by clinicians other than genetic counselors  \nTherefore  these findings underestimate receipt of genetic \ncounseling services  Mammography and MRI percentages \nare likely overestimates because both screening and diagnostic \nindications are included  42 \n\nConclusion\nAlthough BRCA testing rates were lower in nonmetropolitan \n\nareas  they increased proportionally more than in metropolitan \nareas  Regional and age differences in BRCA testing rates reveal \nspecific population subgroups with greater metropolitan and \nnonmetropolitan differences  Administrative data used in this \nreport can help public health officials monitor changes over \ntime in the differences in BRCA testing rates and receipt of \n\npreventive services between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan \npopulations to address differences in BRCA testing rates  \nspecifically  and  possibly  genetic services  in general  However  \nadministrative data cannot be used to assess compliance with \nrecommendations for testing and preventive services  To \nmonitor the extent to which BRCA testing rates and receipt \nof preventive interventions after BRCA testing adhere to \nevidence-based guidelines and result in actions likely to prevent \ndeath from certain cancers  improved surveillance tools are \nneeded to determine the indications for and results of BRCA \ntesting  CDC funds state health departments to promote the \napplication of best practices for evidence-based breast cancer \ngenomics through
