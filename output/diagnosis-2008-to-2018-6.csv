breast cancer biology and treatment  These assays\nhave traditionally been performed by analysis of cell culture or tissue\nsamples  More recently  functional and molecular imaging has\nallowed the in vivo assay of biochemistry and molecular biology \nwhich is highly complementary to tissue-based assays  This review\nbriefly describes different imaging modalities used in molecular\nimaging and then reviews applications of molecular imaging to\nbreast cancer  with a focus on translational work  It includes\nsections describing work in functional and physiological tumor\nimaging  imaging gene product expression  imaging the tumor\nmicroenvironment  reporter gene imaging  and cell labeling  Work in\nboth animal models and human is discussed with an eye towards\nstudies that have relevance to breast cancer treatment in patients \n\nIntroduction\nThe ability to assay cancer biological features is key to\nadvances in both the basic and clinical science of breast\ncancer  Advances in our ability to assay molecular processes \nincluding gene expression  protein expression  and molecular\nand cellular biochemistry  have fueled recent advances in our\nunderstanding of breast cancer biology and our ability to treat\nbreast cancer in patients  Most assays require sampling of\ncells or tissues to perform the measurements  Thus  the cell\nculture system  animal model  or patient must be perturbed in\norder to perform the assay  This requirement makes serial\nassays over time more difficult and leaves open the possibility\nthat the assay itself may change the state of the system being\nmeasured  The ability to measure biological processes\nwithout perturbing them would be highly desirable and would\noffer complementary information to that obtained by most\ntraditional assay methods \n\nAdvances in both technology and cancer science have led to\nthe ability to perform non-invasive molecular assays  An\nexample is the use of reporter genes whose expression\nresults in the production of material such as green\n\nfluorescent protein or luciferase that can be detected without\ntissue sampling [1]  Another advance  applicable to the entire\nrange of biological systems from cell culture to human  is\nmolecular imaging [2 3]  which is the focus of this review \n\nImaging has traditionally relied on structural and anatomic\nfeatures to detect breast cancer and determine its extent [4] \nThis traditional form of imaging  often termed anatomic\nimaging  has made an important contribution to cancer care \nand is widely used in the detection and staging of breast\ncancer patients using methods such as X-ray mammography\nand computed tomography  CT  More recently  imaging has\nexpanded to include the ability to image regional biochemistry\nand molecular biology  often termed molecular imaging [2] \nThe focus for molecular imaging is not structure  but rather\nregional biology  Quantitative analysis is an important feature\nof this type of imaging  for example  the ability to measure\nregional tumor receptor expression [5 6]  As such  molecular\nimaging can be considered an in vivo assay technique \ncapable of measuring regional tumor biology without perturb-\ning it  This makes molecular imaging a unique tool for probing\nbreast cancer biology  complementary to traditional assay\nmethods  and a potentially very powerful tool for translational\nscience  In the sections that follow  imaging methods used in\nmolecular imaging are reviewed  the biological processes that\ncan be assayed are discussed  and selected examples of\ntranslational science using molecular imaging are reviewed \nThe focus is on in vivo imaging of animal models and patients \n\nIt is important to keep in perspective inherent differences in\ncapabilities between tissue-based assays and in vivo assays\nusing molecular imaging  Imaging is non-invasive and \ntherefore  better suited to serial assay  In addition  imaging\ntypically surveys the entire animal or patient and  therefore \navoids sampling errors that can occur for assays that require\ntissue sampling  especially when there is significant tumor\nheterogeneity  However

Suppl 1 Mankoff\n\nassay many different processes at once - for example  the\nexpression of an array of genes [7] - imaging can typically\nsample at most a few processes at the same time  Also  while\nit is possible to ‘batch’ process for many samples at the same\ntime  imaging needs to be performed one subject at a time \nFurthermore  the need for sophisticated equipment and\nimaging probes makes imaging typically more expensive than\nsample-based assays  These last two factors limit the number\nof subjects that can be studied by imaging compared to\nsample assays  In general  imaging methods are comple-\nmentary to assay-based methods and best used to explore\nbreast cancer biology in intact animal models or patients  or\nto image the effects of therapeutic intervention on in vivo\ntumor biology \n\nImaging modalities\nThe imaging modalities most commonly used in molecular\nimaging are listed in Table 1  Common among these modali-\nties is the ability to image functional and molecular tissue\nproperties such as perfusion  metabolism  and receptor or\noncogene expression [5 8-12]  This section provides a brief\ndescription of each modality  along with its advantages and\ndisadvantages \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMagnetic resonance  MR  relies upon the interaction of\natomic nuclei with radiofrequency signals in the presence of\nstrong magnetic fields  MR imaging  MRI  offers high spatial\nresolution and functional contrast agents using magnetic\nelements such as Gd and Fe [10]  Breast MRI using non-\n\nspecific contrast agents such ad Gd-DTPA has become an\nimportant part of clinical breast cancer [13]  and there have\nbeen some notable recent successes in the use of breast\nMRI for breast cancer detection [14]  More detailed and\nquantitative approaches to dynamic contrast enhanced\n DCE  breast MRI have been increasingly used to examine\ntumor perfusion and capillary permeability as an indicator of\ntumor angiogenesis [15-17]  More specific and targeted MRI\nagents have also been developed and undergone preliminary\ntesting [18]  however  the range of possible molecular agents\nis somewhat constrained by the need to include a\nmagnetically active atom such as Gd or Fe  Recent advances\nin pulse sequences and image acquisition have led to the\nability to measure other tissue properties  such as water\ndiffusion  that can provide information on cellularity and\ninterstitial transport without the need for contrast [19 20]  An\nadvantage of MRI is its high spatial resolution and image\nquality  especially with increasing magnetic field strength \nmaking it applicable to both small animals and patient\nimaging  Limitations include the cost of the imaging system\nand the thus far somewhat limited range of imaging probes\nthat serve as MR contrast agents  although new approaches\ntested in pre-clinical models will provide increased capabili-\nties for animal research and may be able to be translated to\npatient studies [18] \n\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy\nMR spectroscopy  MRS  takes advantage of the ability of\nnuclear magnetic resonance to identify specific chemical\nsignatures and measures the regional concentrations of bio-\n\nTable 1\n\nFunctional and molecular imaging methods\n\nModality Advantages Disadvantages\n\nMagnetic resonance\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging  MRI  High spatial

possible relatively superficial sites\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nchemical species  using methods similar to those developed\nfor basic chemical assays [9]  Much of current work in\npatients uses hydrogen spectroscopy  however  spectroscopy\nfor other biologically relevant nuclei  such as phosphorus or\nsodium  is also possible [21]  MRS can quantify the\nconcentration of prevalent biochemical species without\nperturbing the system being imaged  and without the need for\nimaging contrast administration  MRS has considerably more\nlimited spatial resolution compared to MRI  however  recent\nadvances in magnetic field strength and MRS technology\nhave yielded the ability to generate three-dimensional MRS\nconcentration maps  MRS images  MRSI  with resolution on\nthe order of 1 cm or less [9]  Recent studies suggest that\nchanges in local metabolites with therapy may provide a very\nearly indicator of breast cancer response [22]  MRS has the\nadvantage of being able to directly quantify molecular species\nwithout the need for contrast  with the disadvantages of more\nlimited spatial resolution and the need for relatively high\nabundance to be able to reliably quantify regional bio-\nchemical concentration  It shares the need for relatively\nexpensive equipment with MRI  and in fact  requires fairly high\nfield strength  typically 3T or more  to be effective for animal\nand patient breast studies [9] \n\nRadionuclide imaging\nRadionuclide imaging relies on the use of imaging probes \ntypically termed radiopharmaceuticals  tagged with radio-\nactive nuclei [5]  Position-sensitive radiation detectors identify\nemitted photons and generate images of regional\nradiopharmaceutical concentration  This imaging approach \nsometimes called nuclear medicine  has traditionally relied on\ngamma-emitters such as 99mTc or 131I to form images in a\ntechnique often termed single-photon computed tomography\n SPECT  Somewhat more recently  advances in both\ninstrumentation and radiochemistry have led to the ability to\nimage positron-emitting nuclei  such as 11C and 18F  in a wide\nrange of molecules in an approach known as positron\nemission tomography  PET  [23]  Compared to SPECT  PET\noffers the potential for better spatial resolution  more accurate\nimage quantification  and a wider range of possible imaging\nprobes  however  both PET and SPECT have made notable\ncontributions to breast cancer clinical care and research\n[5 23 24]  The chief advantage of radionuclide imaging is the\nability to measure probe concentrations in the nanomolar  and\neven picomolar  range  leading to the ability to measure even\nthe most sensitive molecular processes without perturbing\nthem  A wide range of radiopharmaceuticals has been\ndeveloped to image diverse aspects of breast cancer biology\n[25]  Disadvantages include more limited spatial resolution\nand the need to produce and distribute relatively short-lived\nimaging probes  Recent development in dedicated imaging\ndevices for small animals [26] and breast-specific imaging\n[27] has overcome some of the limitations in spatial\nresolution  however  inherent spatial resolution is less than for\nother methods such as CT or MRI  The combination of PET or\nSPECT with X-ray CT  PET/CT or SPECT/CT  yields co-\n\nregistered molecular and anatomic images and the\nopportunity to image molecular biology and anatomy\nsimultaneously [28]  Radionuclide imaging probes and\ninstrumentation are relatively expensive  with costs\ncomparable to MRI \n\nOptical imaging\nOne of the oldest forms of imaging is optical imaging  using\nvisible light to generate images  In many ways optical imaging\nis the earliest form of cancer imaging  in the form of light\nmicroscopy  Recent advances in instrumentation  computa-\ntional algorithms  and imaging probes have led to new\ncapabilities in optical imaging of living organisms  including\nsmall animal models and patients [29]  A variety of optical\nmethods have been developed that can yield in vivo images\nwith high contrast  and  in some cases  considerable detail \ndown to the microscopic level  Methods can measure\nregional biology such as vascularity and blood volume using\ninherent tissue optical properties [29]  or take advantage of\nan ever increasing array of optical probes to image specific\nmolecular processes [30]  Low cost  portability  ease of use \nand wide availability of imaging probes are key advantages of\noptical imaging  Its chief disadvantage is relatively limited\ntissue penetration  Thus  while optical imaging has become\nan essential tool for breast cancer animal research [31]  its\nuse in patients has been more limited  While promising early\nstudies in breast tumor imaging point towards future clinical\napplication [29]  optical imaging has been mostly confined\nthus far to the pre-clinical setting  where it is an important tool\nfor breast cancer research \n\nUltrasound\nUltrasound imaging works by using acoustical transducers to\nsend and receive ultrasound frequency energy and generate\nthree-dimensional images from either reflection or through-\ntransmission [8]  Conventional ultrasound provides high-\nresolution anatomic detail  and breast ultrasound plays an\nimportant role in breast cancer diagnosis [32]  Doppler\ntechnology also provides information on tumor vascularity \nand with the advent of microbubble contrast agents  tumor\nperfusion [33]  Recent advances in imaging technology [34]\nand the development of targeted microbubble contrast\nagents hold promise for molecular imaging [33]  The\nportability and relatively low cost of ultrasound make it an\nideal tool for both animal and patient imaging  and the ability\nto measure molecular processes will make ultrasound a\nvaluable tool for breast cancer research  Disadvantages\ninclude some operator dependence in image acquisition and\ninterpretation  and some challenges in developing molecularly\ntargeted micobubble contrast agents \n\nOther imaging modalities such as X-ray radiography and\nX-ray CT play an important role in structural imaging  but are\nmore limited for molecular imaging  Dynamic contrast CT can\nbe used to measure tissue perfusion  similar to DCE-MRI \nwith the disadvantage of relatively high radiation exposure \n\nAvailable online http //breast-cancer-research com/content/10/S1/S3\n\n\n\nOther techniques are also being investigated [35]  but are at\nrelatively early stages of development and not discussed in\ndetail here \n\nImaging assays  what can be measured \nMolecular and functional imaging that can measure a range of\ncancer biological features have been developed and validated \nThese capabilities are reviewed in this section  broadly\ndividing categories of imaging assays into functional/physio-\nlogical properties  protein expression  with an emphasis on\ntumor receptors  the tumor microenvironment  and tumor\ngene expression  Both applications to animal models [36]\nand patients [23] are reviewed \n\nFunctional physiological tumor properties\nImaging is ideally suited to measuring in vivo tumor biology\nrelated to basic physiological properties such as perfusion \nmetabolism  biosynthesis  cell proliferation  and cell death  In\nfact  many of these processes are difficult to assay by tissue\nsampling  therefore  imaging provides a unique and quantitative\nmeasure of these properties that can only be measured in vivo \n\nTumor perfusion is one of the earliest physiological properties\nto be measured  and advances in methodology have led to\nincreasingly quantitative approaches  The most physiologi-\ncally robust and quantitative measures of tumor blood flow\nuse freely diffusible imaging probes  where blood flow can be\ninferred from the time course of probe uptake and washout \nadapting methods developed for measuring cerebral blood\nflow [37]  One example is the use of 15O-water to measure\ntumor blood flow by PET  which yields measures of tumor\nblood flow in ml/minute/g that have been validated against\nmicrosphere methods [38]  Water PET imaging has been\nshown to be effective in monitoring breast cancer response \nand changes in tumor perfusion with treatment measured by\nwater PET are predictive of survival [39]  Diffusable optical\nprobes may also be used for this purpose [29]  Considerable\neffort has been devoted to the quantification of tumor\nperfusion and tumor capillary permeability using radiographic\nand MRI contrast agents [40-44]  These agents have some-\nwhat limited permeability across capillaries  therefore  their in\nvivo kinetics are dependent upon both blood flow and\ncapillary permeability  Increasingly sophisticated image\nacquisition and analysis methods  for DCE-MRI in particular \nhave led to the ability to measure regional breast cancer\nperfusion and capillary permeability in both animal models\nand patients [17]  Novel MRI contrast agents  including\nmacromolecular agents  may offer additional capabilities [45] \nThese methods have been applied in early trials of anti-\nangiogenic therapy breast cancer and have yielded insights\ninto the nature of response [16]  Standardized methods for\nDCE-MRI for clinical trials have been proposed [46] \n\nTumor perfusion imaging requires good vascular access for\nprompt and reliable delivery of the imaging probe  and has\ntherefore been more challenging in animal models  however \n\nrecent work using inhaled radionuclide agents hold promise\nfor small animal research applications [47] \n\nTumor metabolism has also been widely studied by imaging \nPerhaps the best known example is the measurement of\nregional glucose metabolism using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\n FDG  PET  which is now routinely used in breast cancer\nclinical practice to determine the extent of tumor spread and\nassess response to treatment [5 25]  This method can also\nbe readily applied to animal models [48]  and can yield\ndetailed physiological information through kinetic analysis of\ndynamic images [49 50]  Other PET radiopharmaceuticals\ncan be used to measure other aspects of metabolism  inclu-\nding regional oxygen consumption and fatty acid metabolism\n[25]  MRS has also been quite useful in measuring\nmetabolism through 1H spectroscopy to measure levels of\nlactate and other biochemical species key in metabolism [51]\nand also through phosphorous spectroscopy to measure\nconcentrations of adenine nucleotides as an indicator of\nenergy metabolism [52]  Other studies in a variety of tumors \nespecially in brain tumors and prostate cancer  have shown\nthe ability to measure biochemical species in a variety of\nmetabolic pathways - for example  membrane lipids  choline \nand metabolic intermediates  citrate  - and have provided\nimproved diagnosis  early measures of response  and insights\ninto pathophysiology [53-58]  The chemical composition of\nthe breast  particularly its high lipid content  provides some\nchallenges for MRS  but recent progress in magnet field\nstrength  acquisition  and processing methods may offer\nimproved capabilities in breast cancer [59] \n\nAberrant cellular proliferation is a fundamental property of\ncancer  including breast cancer [60]  Labeled compounds\nsuch as 14C- or 3H-thmyidine have been an important method\nfor measuring cellular proliferation through sampling  dating\nback over 40 years [61]  Early work used PET and 11C-\nthymidine to measure tumor proliferation by imaging  and\nquantitative imaging approaches were validated against in\nvitro assay gold standards [62]  However  the short half-life of\n11C  20 minutes  and the extensive in vivo metabolism of\nthymidine limit the feasibility of this approach for both animal\nand patient imaging  More recent work using thymidine\nanalogs labeled with 18F  half-life 109 minutes  have been\ndeveloped and undergone considerable advances in recent\nyears [63 64]  The most promising of these had been 18F-\nfluorothymidine  FLT  with notable recent results in both\nanimal and patient breast cancer imaging [65-68]  FLT PET\nappears especially promising for measuring the early effects\nof therapy on breast cancer growth  as suggested by recent\nstudies by Kenny and colleagues [66]  This imaging approach\nhad also been validated against in vitro assay of proliferation\n reviewed in [63]  and is poised for greater use in both animal\nresearch and human clinical trials \n\nMethods for imaging cell death have also been investigated \nbut are at an earlier stage of development  Many of these\n\nBreast Cancer Research    Vol 10 Suppl 1 Mankoff\n\nPage 4 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\n\n\nhave been based upon an extension of Annexin V staining in\nvitro  which indicates apoptotic cells through binding to\nphosphotidyl serines [69]  The molecules are found only on\nthe inner surface of plasma membranes and  therefore \nnormally not accessible to Annexin V  a peptide  for binding \nHowever  during apoptosis  these molecules are transiently\nexposed to the extracellular space  allowing binding of\nAnnexin [69]  The earliest studies used 99mTc-annexin and\nSPECT imaging to measure apoptosis in animal models and\npatients [69 70]  More recently  methods for annexin-based\napoptosis imaging have been developed for PET  MRI  optical\nimaging  and ultrasound [71]  One limitation of this approach\nhas been the transient nature of phosphatidyl serine exposure\nduring cell death  resulting in fairly limited signal for imaging\n[72]  Other approaches targeted to other aspects of the\napoptotic cascade are being investigated [71]  An alternative \nbut less specific approach has been to use MRI measures of\nwater diffusion through the extracellular space as an indirect\nmeasure of tumor cellularity [19 73]  Increases in the diffusion\ncoefficient  as an indicator of a decrease in tumor cellularity \nhave correlated with measures of apoptosis in animal models\n[19] and response to therapy in early patient studies [20 73] \nThis method has the advantage of being available using\nexisting MRI instrumentation for both animal and patient\nimaging without the need for imaging probes  but provides a\nrelatively indirect measure of cell death \n\nSeveral methods can also measure biosynthesis as an\nindicator of tumor growth  with approaches targeted to\nprotein synthesis and membrane synthesis  The uptake of\nlabeled amino acids  such as 11C-methionine  has been\nshown to correlate with tumor growth  and changes in uptake\nprovide an early indication of breast cancer response to\ntherapy [74]  This approach  however  is limited by the\ncomplex nature of amino acid metabolism pathways  making it\ndifficult to measure protein synthetic rate versus amino acid\ntransport and metabolism [75]  Artificial amino acids have\nalso been tested as indicators of amino acid transport [76] \n\nProliferating tumor cells also engage in enhanced lipid bio-\nsynthesis to provide material needed for cellular membranes\n[77]  This process can also be assayed through molecular\nimaging using several different methods  Spurred by results in\nbrain tumor imaging [57]  MRS studies of breast cancer have\nshown increased choline pool sizes to be a feature of breast\nmalignancy [9 78]  Interestingly  changes in the choline\nconcentration measured by MRS early in treatment appear to\nbe a marker for early response to therapy  as early as 24 hours\nafter treatment with chemotherapy [22]  These exciting early\nfindings are now being tested in a large prospective\ncooperative group trial  Lipid metabolism can also be studied\nby PET using either 11C or 18F labeled choline  or 11C-acetate\n[79]  which enters lipid synthesis from the tricarboxylic acid\n TCA  cycle via fatty acid synthetase  Fatty acid synthetase\nhas been show to have increased activity and expression in\ncancer and may be a target for therapy [80]  This approach\n\nhas shown considerable promise in other tumors such as\nprostate cancer [81]  including therapeutic response [82]  but\nhas not been applied to the same extent in breast cancer [83] \n\nProtein expression  tumor receptors\nThe ability to measure the expression of specific proteins that\nare gene products associated with breast cancer has led to\nimportant advances in breast cancer treatment  Examples\ninclude the expression of estrogen receptors  ERs  a target for\nendocrine therapy [84]  and HER2  also increasingly a target of\ntumor-specific treatment [85]  Molecular imaging has also been\napplied to measuring specific protein expression [6 24] \nAdvantages of imaging include its non-invasiveness  the ability\nto measure receptor expression in the entire disease burden\nand thus the ability to avoid sampling error that can occur with\nheterogeneous receptor expression  and the potential for serial\nstudies of in vivo drug effects on the target  A very practical\nconsideration is that imaging can assess receptor expression\nat sites that are challenging to sample and assay  for example \nbone metastases  where de-calcification can make assay of\ntumor gene products challenging \n\nImaging protein expression  particularly tumor receptors \nposes some unique challenges  For receptors  imaging\nresults can be quite sensitive to the molecular quantity of the\nimaging probe needed to generate the image  Most receptors\nhave high affinity for their ligands and are active at micromolar\nor nanomolar concentrations of the ligand  Even small molar\nquantities of the imaging agent may saturate the receptor and\nlimit the ability to visualize receptor expression [86 87]  For\nthis reason  molecular imaging of tumor receptors has been\nmost successful to date with radionuclide imaging  PET and\nSPECT  where it is possible to generate images with nano-\nmolar or picomolar amounts of the imaging probe  For larger\nmolecules  like peptides and monoclonal antibodies  other\nlabels suitable for optical  MR  and ultrasound imaging are\npossible [6]  however  for small-molecule receptor imaging\nagents  such as labeled steroids for steroid receptors  radio-\nnuclide imaging appears to be the only feasible approach \n\nThe most work to date in this area of breast cancer research\nhas been done for steroid receptors [6 88]  Considerable\nefforts have gone into the development of radiopharma-\nceuticals for ER imaging  as reviewed in [88-90]  Although a\nvariety of ER imaging agents have been tested  and continue\nto be developed and tested  the most successful ER imaging\nradiopharmaceutical to date is 16 alpha-[18F]-fluoro-17 beta-\nestradiol  FES  [87 91]  FES has binding characteristics\nsimilar to estradiol for both the ER and the transport protein\nSHBG [92 93]  It can be synthesized with sufficient specific\nactivity that high-quality patient images can be made with\ninjections of less than 5 μg of FES [94]  Regional estrogen\nbinding is readily quantified by FES PET  and FES uptake has\nbeen validated as a measure of ER expression in breast\ntumors against ER expression assay of tissue samples by\nradioligand binding [95] and immunohistochemistry [96]  FES\n\nAvailable online http //breast-cancer-research com/content/10/S1/S3\n\nPage 5 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\n\n\nuptake is readily visualized and quantified in primary and\nmetastatic breast cancer [97]  It can identify heterogeneous\nER expression  for example  loss of ER expression in meta-\nstases arising from ER-expressing primary tumors [94 97] \nThe level of FES uptake has been shown to be predictive of\nresponse to endocrine therapy [94 98]  including heavily\npre-treated patients  Figure 1  Serial FES PET can also\nmeasure the pharmacodynamic effect of drugs on estradiol\nbinding to the ER [98 99]  yielding insights into determinants\nof drug efficacy \n\nWhile PET ER imaging had been successful  efforts to image\nprogesterone receptor  PR  have been less successful\n[100 101]  In a study of the PR imaging agent 21-[18F]fluoro-\n16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone  uptake was seen in some\ntumors  but the level of uptake did not correlate with the level\nof PR expression  This may be in large part due to the\nrelatively low affinity of progestins for the PR  with binding\naffinities that are orders of magnitude lower than those of\nandrogens and androgen receptors and estrogens and ERs\n[101]  As such  relatively high non-specific binding compared\nto specific binding of imaging probes may limit their utility for\nPR imaging  Later studies also showed that the radiopharma-\nceutical tested was rapidly metabolized in human to a\nmetabolite with poor receptor binding [102]  a finding that\n\nwas not predicted by pre-clinical models  Efforts to develop\neffective PR imaging agents continue [103] \n\nHER2  ErbB2  expression in breast cancer has become an\nimportant indicator of prognosis and an increasingly impor-\ntant target for therapy [104]  Recent efforts have focused on\nimaging HER2 expression in breast cancer  The most\nsuccess and largest number of studies to date used imaging\nprobes based upon immune recognition to image HER2\nexpression  Specific imaging probes based on radiolabeled\nantibodies or fragments [105-109]  or novel constructs such\nas affibodies [110 111]  have shown success in early studies \nStudies using a 68Ga-labeled F ab’ 2 fragment of trastuzumab\nby Smith-Jones and colleagues [112 113] demonstrated the\nfeasibility of measuring regional HER2 expression in murine\nanimal models  The imaging results nicely demonstrated\nalterations in HER2 expression accompanying experimental\ntherapy using HSP90-directed agents  geldamycin analogs \nto disrupt protein chaperoning and reduce HER2 expression\n[112 113]  Studies using 131I- or 111In-labeled trastuzumab\nhave demonstrated the ability to image tumor expression of\nHER2 and tumor and normal tissue accumulation of\ntrastuzumab [108 114 115]  although there has been some\ncontroversy about the significance of uptake in normal tissues\nprone to trastuzumab toxicity  such as the heart [108 115] \nPromising early patient studies have also been presented for\n89Zr-labeled trastuzumab [116] \n\nFor imaging using larger molecules like monoclonal anti-\nbodies and fragments  as in the case of HER2 imaging  an\neven wider range of probes  and therefore imaging\nmodalities  may be possible  including optical  ultrasound \nand MR-based probes [117-122]  Koyama [123] demon-\nstrated specific fluorescence imaging of HER2-expressing\nlung metastasis in an animal model  Others have used near-\ninfrared imaging of HER2 expression in vitro using gold\nnanoshell bioconjugates [124] and fluorochrome labeling\n[125]  Pre-clinical studies using specific antibodies conju-\ngated to gadolinium or magnetic nanoparticles demonstrated\nthe feasibility of MRI antibody imaging in cells [126] and\nanimal models [118]  Early studies of nanoparticle-based\nultrasound probes conjugated to HER2-specific antibodies\nhave demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in early in\nvitro studies and simulated in vivo studies [119 127]  The\nability to image with multiple modalities is particularly helpful\nfor translating research from the pre-clinical to clinical setting \nFor example  optical imaging is extremely valuable for small-\nanimal studies  but has limited utility in patients due to poor\ntissue penetration for imaging deeper structures  The ability\nto translate optical imaging findings into PET or MRI imaging\nin patients  seen in early work for HER2 imaging  holds great\npromise for facilitating translational research \n\nTumor microenvironment\nMolecular imaging provides a unique opportunity to image the\ntumor microenvironment  which is challenging by

129] \nhas been widely studied by imaging  with some recent\nstudies in breast cancer [130]  Most work has been done\nusing PET imaging and the agent 18F-fluoromisonidazole\n FMISO   Figure 2  however  other PET hypoxia probes have\nbeen developed and tested [38]  Other hypoxia imaging\nmethods based upon MRI and optical approaches are at an\nearlier stage of development  but appear promising [131 132] \n\nTumor vasculature plays a key role in tumor growth and\nmetastasis  and is also important in the delivery of systemic\ntherapeutic agents  Imaging of tumor vasculature and the\ndelivery of nutrients and drugs has also been an area of\ninterest  Tumor perfusion and capillary transport provide an\nindirect measure of tumor vasculature and can be imaged by\nDCE-MRI and PET  which have been effective in measuring\ntumor response in early studies [16 38 39]  In addition \ntargeted imaging probes can non-invasively and specifically\nassess tumor neo-vasculature  PET probes based upon\nspecific labeled peptides that bind to integrins expressed in\nneovessels have been studied in animals and tested in\nhumans [133 134]  MRI probes have been developed and\nare at an earlier stage of testing [40]  Such agents may be\nespecially helpful for therapies directed at tumor neo-\nvasculature  such as bevacizumab \n\nImaging methods to measure nutrient and drug transport have\nalso been developed and tested  For example  the SPECT\nagent 99mTc-sestamibi  developed for myocardial perfusion\nimaging  has been shown to be a substrate for the drug efflux\ntransporter P-glycoprotein [135]  Studies in the setting of pre-\nsurgical chemotherapy showed that the uptake and retention\nof 99mTc-sestamibi was predictive of response to chemo-\ntherapeutic agents that are substrates for P-glycoprotein  such\nas epirubicin [136]  Somewhat more specific and quantitative\nprobes of P-glycoprotein transport have been developed for\nPET imaging [137-139]  Macromolecular MRI contrast agents\nare undergoing testing in patients [140] and may be useful for\nmeasuring the delivery of therapeutic agents  such as\ntrastuzumab  that are large molecules where capillary and\ninterstitial transport may pose significant barriers \n\nReporter gene imaging and cell labeling\nAdvances in cancer biology have led to an increasing array of\napproaches to breast cancer therapy  including immuno-\ntherapy and gene therapy  These advances in turn lead to the\nneed for increasingly sophisticated approaches for imaging to\nmonitor these treatments  An increasing body of work in\nmolecular imaging has therefore been devoted to imaging\napproaches capable of imaging gene expression and cellular\ntrafficking and survival in vivo [12 82] \n\nParalleling work done in reporter systems for cell culture \nimaging reporter systems have been developed and are\nincreasingly used in animal model research [141-143] \n\nReporter imaging can use optical approaches  with reporter\ngenes expressing optically detectable molecules such as\ngreen fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase  Optical\napproaches provide inexpensive  readily available methods for\nimaging reporter gene expression  and are widely used in\ncurrent research [144]  Radionuclide methods have also\nbeen developed and widely tested in animal models [143] \nThe most popular approach has been based upon the use of\nviral thymidine kinase as a reporter gene  combined with\nlabeled probes that are specific substrates for phos-\nphorylation by viral thymidine kinase [145 146]  This results in\nprobe trapping and high-contrast  readily quantifiable images\n[147]  A variety of other radionuclide reporter systems have\nbeen used  including the NaI symporter and radioiodine \nreceptor expression  for example  dopamine  and receptor\nbinding ligands  and alternative metabolic substrates\n[148 149]  Some progress has also been made in MRI\nreporter systems [150 151]  however  this work is at an\nearlier stage than optical and PET approaches \n\nThe development of therapeutic approaches mediated by\nspecific cells - for example  immunotherapy - has generated\nincreasing interest in cell labeling and imaging  Cell labeling\n\nAvailable online http //breast-cancer-research com/content/10/S1/S3\n\nPage 7 of 12\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nFigure 2\n\nBreast tumor

often\nrequires isolation of the cells to assure that only the desired\ncells are imaged  In cell therapy where molecular\nmanipulation is possible  cells engineered with reporter\nsystems can also be used to provide specific cell labeling\nthat does not require isolation of cells and that remains with\nthe cells through subsequent generations  unlike most non-\nspecific methods [153]  For immunotherapy  the generation\nof reporter systems that do not themselves engender an\nimmune response is a challenge and represents an active\narea of research [154] \n\nSummary and future directions\nAdvances in molecular biology create new opportunities for\nunderstanding and treating breast cancer  and also create\nnew needs for increasingly sophisticated and quantitative\nassays  Advances in both technology and molecular biology\nhave led to the capability for molecular imaging  a method for\nnon-invasive and regional assay of in vivo tumor biology \nWhile some molecular imaging methods  most notably\nSPECT and PET  have begun to be used in patients  many\nmolecular imaging approaches have  as yet  undergone only\nearly testing at a pre-clinical stage  Some methods  such as\noptical reporter gene imaging  have already become an\nimportant part of basic research in animal models  Other\napproaches  such as PET imaging of tumor receptor\nexpression  look very promising in early patient studies  but\nhave yet to make it to larger clinical trials or clinical practice \nOnly a relatively few approaches  such as FDG PET  have\nmade their way into clinical practice \n\nMolecular imaging offers a very powerful tool for translating\nbasic science into clinical benefit  This can happen in several\nways  Demonstration that molecular pathways discovered in\nanimal models have relevance to human breast cancer is a\ncritical aspect of breast cancer translational research  Mole-\ncular imaging offers a way to assess and quantify pathways in\nboth animal models and patients in order to verify that the\npathways behave similarly in both cases  In addition  molecular\nimaging used to guide drug development and pre-clinical\ntesting can be applied to early clinical studies to provide\nproof-of-concept  early evidence of efficacy  and a pharma-\ncodynamic measure by which to optimize dosing [155] \n\nThere are a number of potential hurdles to translating\nmolecular imaging methods from animals to humans  Some\napproaches that work well in animals - for example  optical\nimaging - may not be applicable to patients  Multi-modality\nimaging approaches - for example  combined optical/MR/PET\nreporters - may be very helpful in this regard  There may be\nsignificant regulatory hurdles to the use of some imaging\nprobes in patients  Recent efforts in collaborations between\nthe NCI  FDA  and other organizations show promise in\nhelping to facilitate clinical trials of new probes [156] \n\nEchoing trends in molecular breast cancer therapy  clinical\ntrials of molecular imaging may need new approaches to\nclinical study design  using measures such as prognosis or\nresponse as endpoints  rather than sensitivity and specificity\nfor tumor detection [4]  Cooperative groups and scientific\norganizations have recognized this need and are beginning to\naddress it through a variety of approaches  including multi-\ncenter trials [157]  While somewhat daunting  these hurdles\nare clearly surmountable by close collaboration between\nbreast cancer biologists  clinicians  and imagers  Early results\nsuggest that molecular imaging will play an important role in\ntranslational breast cancer research and the care of breast\ncancer patients and strongly support ongoing efforts in this\narea of research

October 22  2008  sent for review October 11  2008 \n\nAlthough the role of liganded nuclear receptors in mediating\ncoactivator/corepressor exchange is well-established  little is\nknown about the potential regulation of chromosomal organiza-\ntion in the 3-dimensional space of the nucleus in achieving inte-\ngrated transcriptional responses to diverse signaling events  Here \nwe report that ligand induces rapid interchromosomal interactions\namong specific subsets of estrogen receptor  -bound transcription\nunits  with a dramatic reorganization of nuclear territories  which\ndepends on the actions of nuclear actin/myosin-I machinery and\ndynein light chain 1  The histone lysine demethylase  LSD1  is\nrequired for these ligand-induced interactive loci to associate with\ndistinct interchromatin granules  long thought to serve as ‘‘stor-\nage’’ sites for the splicing machinery  some critical transcription\nelongation factors  and various chromatin remodeling complexes \nWe demonstrate that this 2-step nuclear rearrangement is essential\nfor achieving enhanced  coordinated transcription of nuclear re-\nceptor target genes \n\nenhancement of gene expression   nuclear architecture  \nchromosomal movement   interchromosomal interactions   SC35 domains\n\nThe molecular mechanism used by nuclear receptors to mediatecoactivator/corepressor exchanges in gene activation has been\nwell elucidated  1  2  However  recent genome-wide analyses of\nDNA binding sites for transcription factors  including estrogen\nreceptor  ER   revealed numerous intergenic sites  only a few of\nwhich have clearly been established to function as enhancers in vivo\n 3–5  raising intriguing questions about whether and how some of\nthese remote binding sites might communicate with their putative\ntarget genes via long-distance intrachromosomal and  potentially \ninterchromosomal interactions \nAlthough the architectural organization of the nucleus is still\n\npoorly understood  6  7  repartitioning of active genes from\ninterior to the periphery of nuclear territories has been suggested\nfor Hox genes in ES cells  8  IgH in   lymphocytes  9  c-maf in\nT cells  10  Mash1 in neuronal cells  11  and Cftr in adenocar-\ncinoma cells  12  Many recent studies have documented inter-\nchromosomal interactions to provide novel control mechanisms\nfor regulated gene expression in interphase nuclei  13–20 \nHere  we report rapid and 17 -estradiol  E2 -induced inter-\n\nactions between gene loci located in different chromosomes \nsuggesting a potentially dynamic system that operates to provide\ncoordinated control for regulated gene expression inmammalian\ncells  We found that the interacting loci exhibit LSD1-dependent\ninteractions with interchromatin granules that harbor key factors\nfor transcriptional elongation and pre-mRNA splicing  suggest-\ning at least 2 steps for nuclear reorganization and gene repar-\ntitioning critical for enhanced gene expression  These findings\nprovide a model for coordinated regulation of specific gene\ntranscription in the nucleus  and we suggest that the strategy may\nbe widely used for signal-induced gene expression programs \n\nResults\nIdentification of Estrogen-Induced Interchromosomal Interactions \nWe devised an initial  open-ended approach to detecting long-\ndistance genomic interactions by coupling the chromosome\nconformation capture  3C  assay  21  with the ChIP-DSL strat-\negy that we recently developed for large-scale promoter array\nand tiling array analyses  22  a method we refer to as decon-\nvolution of DNA interaction by DSL or the 3D assay  Fig  1A \nIn pilot experiments on MCF7 cells treated with E2 for 60min \nwe isolated DNA after in situ restriction digestion followed by\nligation under an extreme dilution condition according to the\nestablished 3C protocol  and after sonication of the DNA  we\nused a biotinylated oligonucleotides to capture DNA fragments\nthat contain the enhancer of the well-studied E2-regulated TFF1\ngene  To detect DNA fragments that were linked to the TFF1\nenhancer during 3C  we annealed a set of DSL oligonucleotide\npairs targeting individual genomic blocks in a 1 4 Mb tiled path\nsurrounding the TFF1 gene in chromosome 21  Fig  S1A  After\nselection  ligation  amplification  and hybridization on the cor-\nresponding tiling

2D  These results establish rapid\nnuclear reorganization in interphase cells in response to ligand \n\nRequirements for ER -Dependent Interchromosomal Interactions  In-\nteractions between TFF1 and GREB1 were apparently depen-\ndent on ER  binding  because a specific siRNA  proven to\neffectively knockdown ER   5  27  effectively blocked the\nE2-induced GREB1 TFF1 interactions  Fig  2E  We next per-\nformed single cell nuclear microinjection  using specific siRNAs\nor blocking antibodies against several specific coactivators \nincluding CBP/p300  Fig  2F  and the p160 coactivator SRC1/\npCIP  Fig  2G  as established  5  27  finding that inactivation\nof these coactivators for ER  also abolished the E2-dependent\nTFF1 GREB1 interactions  We also examined the histone lysine\ndemethylase 1  LSD1  which was recently shown to be essential\nfor E2-dependent gene activation  5  Unexpectedly  we ob-\nserved that LSD1 knockdown had little effect on the E2-\ndependent interchromosomal interactions between the two\ngenes  Fig  2H  This finding implies that E2-induced interchro-\nmosomal interactions precede gene activation \nAlthough there is no filamentous actin in the nucleus  nuclear\n\nactin is present in many transcriptional complexes and reported\nto play an important role in transcriptional activation in yeast\n 28  29  We could also detect oligomerized g-actin with a\nspecific monoclonal antibody  30  in the nucleus of normal\nbreast epithelial cells  Fig  S3A  Treatment of E2-stimulated\nbreast epithelial cells with either latrunculin  a well-\ncharacterized drug that blocks actin polymerization  31  or\nJasplakinolide  which inhibits depolymerization of actin net-\nworks  32  caused a complete loss of E2-induced interchromo-\nsomal interactions  Fig  3A and Fig  S2B  These treatments also\ninhibited E2-induced expression of TFF1 and GREB1  but not\nconstitutive genes  e g   -actin  in MCF7 cells  Fig  3B \nTo further investigate the possibility that interchromosomal\n\ninteractions depend on dynamic nuclear reorganization  we\nperformed single cell nuclear microinjection assay to determine\nthe potential requirement for Nuclear Myosin-I  NMI   33 \nfinding that a specific siRNA against NMI abolished E2-induced\nTFF1 GREB1 interactions  Fig  3C  We also found that nuclear\ninjection of antibodies against NMI blocked E2-induced\nTFF1 GREB1 interactions  Fig  3CRight and Fig  S3B–D  as did\nsimilar single cell nuclear microinjection of the monoclonal\nantibody  2G2  against g-actin  Fig  S3 B–D  Immunohisto-\nchemical analysis confirmed nuclear localization of injected IgG\nagainst NMI and g-actin  Fig  S3 B and D  strongly suggesting\na direct functional requirement for NMI in the nucleus  rather\nthan an indirect effect caused by a disrupted cytoskeleton  To\ndocument the involvement of NMI-based nuclear motors in\nmediating E2-induced interchromosomal interactions  we pre-\nformed rescue experiments  using NMImutants that impair actin\nbinding  e g  R353C  or the ATPase activity  e g  S397L  in the\nnuclear myosin-I ‘‘head’’  34  35  We found that the interchro-\nmosomal interactions abolished with anti-NMI IgG could be\nrestored using the expression vector expressing WT  but not\nmutant NMI defective in actin binding or lacking ATPase\nactivity  Fig  3D and E  This finding agrees with a recent report\nshowing that NMI is required for transcription activation-\ninduced DNA looping out of the nuclear territory  36  We also\ndocumented that WT  but not functionally inactive NMI mu-\ntants  rescued the

Disruption of NMI or DLC1 by siRNA did\nnot cause aberrant recruitment of ER  or its coactivators  such\nas CBP/p300  to the TFF1 promoter  Fig  S6  which suggests that\nthese components of the nuclear motor system act after initial\nER  binding and coactivator recruitment events \n\nFunctional Consequences of Induced Interchromosomal Interactions \nBoth the siRNA and the antibody microinjection experiments\ndescribed above established a correlation between hormone-\ninduced interchromosomal interactions and gene activation  To\ndirectly demonstrate the functional requirement of E2-induced\ninterchromosomal interactions for gene activation  we took\nadvantage of the observation that  50% of cells exhibited\nmonoallelic interactions between chromosome 2 and chromo-\nsome 21 to ask whether the transcription of gene loci engaged in\nthe interchromosomal interactions was enhanced compared with\nnoninteracting alleles in the same cells  We performed RNA\nFISH using probes that span exon-exon junctions and confirmed\n\nthe specificity of the probes in detecting RNA by showing that\nRNase A treatment  14  abolished hybridization signals  data\nnot shown  By determining the volume of the RNA signals for\neach transcript for colocalized and noncolocalized signals  we\nwere able to quantify the level of transcription associated with\ninteracting and noninteracting alleles before and after the E2\ntreatment  Fig  4E  We found that E2 induced modest activation\nof TFF1 and GREB1 from ‘‘noninteracting’’ alleles  suggesting\nthat both alleles may be equally competent in transcriptional\nactivation  Remarkably  expression of these ER  target genes\nexhibited enhancement when engaged in specific interchromo-\nsomal interactions  therefore demonstrating the functional sig-\nnificance of interchromosomal interactions in enhancement of\ngene activation  indeed  this was actually more robust in cells\nwith monoallelic  as opposed to biallelic  interactions  Fig  4E \nThree color DNA RNA serial FISH experiments  using a TFF1\nDNA FISH probe confirmed the colocalization of the genomic\nlocus  and the two colocalized RNA transcripts  data not shown \n\nInterchromatin Granules  Hubs for Interchromosomal Interactions \nHaving established nuclear actin/myosin-mediated gene net-\nworking in the nucleus  we next determined potential nuclear\ndomains that permit or underlie such functional interchromo-\nsomal interactions  We suspected a possible spatial relationship\nwith nuclear speckles  formally known as interchromatin gran-\nules that are enriched with several key transcriptional elongation\nfactors  chromatin remodeling complexes  and essentially all\nfactors required for pre-mRNA splicing  7  38  To test this\nhypothesis  we determined colocalization between FISH probes\nand the splicing factor SC35  a marker for interchromatin\ngranules  39  Inmock-treated primary breast epithelial cells  the\nposition of the TFF1 andGREB1 foci were entirely distinct from\nSC35-positive speckles  Upon E2 treatment  however  the inter-\nacting TFF1/GREB1 foci became intimately associated with two\nof the SC35-positive speckles  Intriguingly  in cells exhibiting\nmonoallelic interactions  the interacting loci  but not noninter-\nacting loci  were observed to associate with interchromatin\ngranules  Fig  5A  In cells with biallelic interactions  both were\npresent in interchromatin granules  Fig  5B  Blocking actin\noligomerization with latrunculin or actin depolymerization with\njasplakinolide impaired the association  Fig  S5C  Likewise \nsiRNAs against DLC1 or BAF53 all similarly blocked the colo-\ncalization of the FISH probes with interchromatin granules  Fig \nS5 B and C and data not shown  These findings suggest that\ninterchromatin granules may function as hubs for gene network-\ning in the nucleus \nBecause LSD1 siRNA was able to block E2-dependent tran-\n\nscription of TFF1 and GREB1  but not their interchromosomal\ninteractions  we investigated whether there might be an effect on\ntheir coalescence with nuclear speckles  Intriguingly  depletion\nof LSD1 by specific siRNA prevented the TFF1/GREB1 loci\nfrom interacting with interchromatin granules as determined by\nboth 2D and 3D FISH with wild-type  but not enzymatically\ninactive LSD1  fully rescuing hub  interchromatin granule inter-\naction  Fig  5 C–E  In concert with our previous observation\nthat LSD1 siRNA decreased  but did not abolish ER  recruit-\nment  5  we detected only a modest reduction in the recruitment\nof coactivators  such as CBP/p300  to ER  target genes in\nresponse to E2  Fig  S7  Together  these findings reveal an\nunexpected role of LSD1 in exerting a key regulatory function in\nlinking transcriptional initiation to full gene activation by pro-\nmoting the association of initial interacting loci to nuclear\ndomains enriched with critical factors for transcription and\ncotranscriptional processing \n\nDiscussion\nOur findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of liganded\nnuclear receptors in initiating specific interchromosomal inter-\n\nFig  4  Enhanced

transcription  Our data also connect nuclear receptor-\nmediated recruitment of coactivators to the actions of the\nnuclear motor machinery in establishing ligand-induced intra-\nand interchromosomal interactions and the association of inter-\nacting gene loci with interchromatin granules  which constitutes\na more complex program for hormone-induced gene expression\nthan previously suspected  Our finding that NMI plays a key role\nin E2-induced gene activation program is consistent with its\ndocumented role in gene expression in other experimental\nsystems  28  29  32  40–42 \nThese data suggest a general model in which dynamic nuclear\n\narchitecture permits rapid association of specific interacting\ngenomic loci with potential ‘‘enhancer hubs’’ for higher level\ninteractions of DNA-bound transcription factors with their\ncofactors  Fig  5F  These events appear to represent at least a\n‘‘two-step’’ program  with a specific histone lysine demethylase\n LSD1  serving as a critical mediator to link initial induced\ninteracting gene loci to interchromatin granules  Our findings of\nrapid  regulated nuclear reorganization is in accord with the\ndocumented role of nuclear actin in mediating the assembly of\nPol II and coactivator complexes  29  43  and with specific\ninterchromosomal interaction events observed in other signal-\ninduced transcription systems  20  44–47  These findings un-\nderscore the chromosome mobility in interphase cells  which has\nbeen appreciated only recently  36  48  49 \nIn contrast to yeast  higher eukaryotic cells seem to have\n\npartitioned their nucleus into various subdomains  50  Strik-\ningly  the dynamic E2-dependent  ER -mediated interchromo-\nsomal interactions has proven to coincide with interchromatin\ngranules  and surprisingly  LSD1 is required for the association\nof initial interacting gene loci with these interchromosomal hubs \nwhich have long been considered as ‘‘storage’’ sites for splicing\nfactors  51  Because interchromatin granules are also enriched\nfor phosphorylated Pol II  several transcriptional elongation\nfactors  such as p-TEFb  and key chromatin remodeling com-\n\nplexes  such as SWI/SNF  reviewed in ref  7  we may now\nconsider this nuclear domain as a specialized ‘‘nuclear factory ’’\nFor hormone-induced genes  the detected

standard of care  We conducted a population-\nbased study to determine the factors associated with the use of percutaneous needle biopsy to diagnose\nbreast cancer in Ontario  Methods  We identified a total of 3644 women who underwent breast tissue sam-\npling  percutaneous needle biopsy or surgical excision  that yielded a diagnosis of cancer between Apr  1 \n2002  and Dec  31  2002  and for whom we were able to obtain complete data  We performed univariate\nand multivariate analyses to examine the association between a number of variables and the use of percuta-\nneous biopsy or surgery for diagnosis and the performance of biopsy with or without image guidance  The\nvariables were age  local health integration network  LHIN  income quintile  urban or rural residence  ac-\ncess to a primary care provider  prior mammogram  prior regular screening mammography  screen-initiated\nbiopsy  and surgeon and radiologist specialization in breast disease  Results  A total of 2374 women  65% \nunderwent percutaneous biopsy to diagnose breast cancer  The use of percutaneous biopsy varied from 22%\nto 81% among LHINs  On multivariate analysis  no patient variables were associated with the use of per-\ncutaneous biopsy for diagnosis  Only the LHIN and surgeon and radiologist specialization were predictive\nof whether a woman received a percutaneous biopsy  These 2 variables  along with income quintile and screen-\ninitiated biopsy  were associated with the use of image-guided biopsy as the method of choice  Conclusion \nGeographic variation in the use of percutaneous biopsy  particularly image-guided biopsy  for the diagnosis of\nbreast cancer exists across Ontario  The frequency of such biopsies may be a useful quality indicator  Strategies\nto improve uptake of organized evidence-based care may increase the use of percutaneous biopsy \n\nContexte   Le diagnostic préopératoire du cancer du sein constitue une norme de soin  Nous avons effec-\ntué une étude représentative pour déterminer les facteurs associés à l’utilisation de la biopsie percutanée à\nl’aiguille pour le diagnostic du cancer du sein en Ontario  Méthodes   Nous avons repéré au total 3644\nfemmes qui ont subi un prélèvement d’échantillon de tissu mammaire  biopsie percutanée à l’aiguille ou\nexcision chirurgicale  ayant abouti à un diagnostic de cancer entre le 1er avril 2002 et le 31 décembre\n2002 et pour lesquelles nous avons pu obtenir des données complètes  Nous avons procédé à des analyses\nà variable unique et à variables multiples pour étudier le lien entre un certain nombre de variables et\nl’utilisation de la biopsie percutanée ou de l’intervention chirurgicale pour poser le diagnostic et l’exécu-\ntion de la biopsie avec ou sans guidage par imagerie  Les variables ont été l’âge  le réseau local d’intégra-\ntion aux services de santé  RLISS  le quintile de revenu  la résidence en milieu urbain ou rural  l’accès à\nun fournisseur de soins primaires  une mammographie antérieure  une mammographie de dépistage pé-\nriodique antérieure  une biopsie effectuée suite à un dépistage et la spécialisation en mammopathie du\nchirurgien et du radiologiste  Résultats   Au total  2374 femmes  65 %  ont subi une biopsie percutanée\nvisant à diagnostiquer le cancer du sein  Le recours à la biopsie percutanée a varié de 22 % à 81 % entre les\nRLISS  Dans le contexte de l’analyse à variables multiples  on n’a pas établi de lien entre les variables des\npatientes et l’utilisation de la biopsie percutanée pour poser le diagnostic  Seul le RLISS et la spécialisa-\ntion du chirurgien et du radiologiste étaient des prédicteurs susceptibles d’indiquer si une femme a subi\nune biopsie percutanée  Ces 2 variables  ainsi que le quintile de revenu et la biopsie effectuée suite à un\ndépistage  étaient associées à la biopsie à guidage par imagerie comme méthode de choix  Conclusion  \nL’utilisation de la biopsie percutanée  et en particulier la biopsie à guidage par imagerie  pour poser le \ndiagnostic de cancer du sein varie selon la région géographique en Ontario  La fréquence de ces biopsies\npeut constituer un indicateur de qualité utile  Des stratégies visant à améliorer l’adoption des soins\nfactuels organisés pourraient accroître l’utilisation de la biopsie percutanée \n\n\n\nThe advent of minimally invasivebiopsy techniques for the diag-\nnosis of breast abnormalities has been\nan important advance in patient man-\nagement  Confirmation of a benign\ndiagnosis can often be achieved with-\nout surgery 1 The use of percutaneous\nbiopsy techniques has improved the\naccuracy and cost-effectiveness of\nbreast cancer diagnosis after screening\nmammography 2 3\n\nBreast cancer is frequently sus-\npected preoperatively based on clin-\nical and radiologic assessment  and\nthe diagnosis is then confirmed by\ntissue sampling  Fine-needle aspira-\ntion biopsy  FNAB  of palpable\nmasses is a widely available technique\nthat provides material for cytologic\nexamination  Insufficient material is\nobtained for diagnosis in about 15%\nof patients 4 Among those samples\nwith adequate cellular material  re-\nported sensitivity levels range from\n72% to 99% 5 Fine-needle aspiration\nbiopsy performed under image guid-\nance has also been applied to the\nevaluation of nonpalpable lesions\nwith similar sensitivity levels  68%–\n100% 5 The variability in reported\nsensitivity levels has been attributed\nto variation in the cellularity of the\nlesions sampled and the small size of\nthe needle used 6\n\nMore recently  14-gauge core nee-\ndle biopsy  CNB  has been adopted\nto obtain tissue samples for histology \nIt has a reported sensitivity of 89%–\n97% and specificity of 96%–99% in\nlarge series 1 7 8 The use of CNB to\nobtain a preoperative diagnosis in\nwomen with cancer facilitates surgical\nplanning and shared decision-\nmaking  The larger tissue sample that\npermits the detection of invasive dis-\nease and preoperatively establishes the\nindication for axillary staging is an\nimportant advantage of CNB over\nFNAB  particularly in the era of sen-\ntinel lymph node biopsy  Core needle\nbiopsy can be used not only to iden-\ntify the presence of cancer  but also to\ndefine the extent of disease when\nmultiple biopsies are taken from the\nperiphery of larger lesions 9 These\n\nfeatures lead to lower rates of positive\nresection margins at first excision 1 10 11\n\nfewer operative procedures to com-\nplete definite surgical therapy1 11–15 and\nimproved cosmetic outcomes owing\nto a reduction in the total volume of\ntissue excised 16\n\nImprovements in the equipment\navailable and the ability to use CNB\ntechniques under both stereotactic\nand ultrasound guidance have pro-\nmoted the adoption of their use such\nthat  in dedicated breast diagnostic\ncentres  surgical biopsy is rarely used\nas a diagnostic procedure  As the\nequipment has become more user-\nfriendly  CNB techniques have also\nbecome widely available in commun-\nity health facilities  Moreover  be-\ncause CNB is well tolerated and asso-\nciated with minimal morbidity  it has\ngarnered increased acceptance among\npatients \n\nDespite the many advantages at-\ntributable to the use of FNAB or\nCNB for the diagnosis of breast ab-\nnormalities  these techniques have not\nbeen universally adopted  We previ-\nously reported that the use of percuta-\nneous biopsy for tissue diagnosis of\nbreast abnormalities in Ontario varied\naccording to patient age  local health\nintegration network  LHIN  urban\nresidence  access to a primary care\nprovider and Ontario Health Insur-\nance Plan  OHIP  screen-initiated\nbiopsy 17 Although women with a\ndiagnosis of cancer were slightly more\nlikely to receive a percutaneous biopsy\nthan those with benign disease  64 7%\nv  60 3%  one-third of women with\nbreast cancer still have the diagnosis\nconfirmed by open biopsy  In the\npresent report  we describe the factors\nassociated with the use of percuta-\nneous biopsy for diagnosis among\nwomen with breast cancer in Ontario \nWe also examine variables associated\nwith the use of image guidance for\nthe performance of percutaneous\nbiopsy  In particular  we evaluate the\neffects of surgeon and radiologist ex-\nperience with breast disease on the\nuse of percutaneous biopsy in women\nwith breast cancer \n\nMethods\n\nStudy population\n\nThe Institute for Clinical Evaluative\nSciences approved our study in keep-\ning with its requirements for patient\nconfidentiality  and ethical and scien-\ntific integrity  Using the Canadian In-\nstitute for Health Information records\nand/or OHIP physician billing\nrecords  we identified all women in\nOntario who had a tissue diagnosis of\na breast abnormality between Apr  1 \n2002  and Dec  31  2002  We se-\nlected our study timeframe because\n2002 was the most recent year after\nthe introduction of the International\nclassification of diseases  version 10\ncodes18 for which complete data were\navailable  Methods of tissue diagnosis\nmay have included percutaneous\nbiopsy  FNAB or CNB  with or with-\nout image guidance  and/or partial\nmastectomy or mastectomy  We\nlinked the patient records to those of\nthe Ontario Cancer Registry to iden-\ntify all women with a diagnosis of\nbreast cancer  To ensure that the\nbiopsy and surgery performed during\nthe study period were likely for the\nsame lesion  we excluded women who\nreceived a diagnosis of breast cancer\nmore than 3 months before or\n6 months after their percutaneous\nneedle biopsies or surgical procedures \nwhichever came first \n\nBilling records for the time period\ncovered in our study did not distin-\nguish between FNAB and CNB \ntherefore we describe the application\nof percutaneous biopsy  FNAB or\nCNB  with or without image guid-\nance in the diagnosis of breast abnor-\nmalities  Similarly  billing records did\nnot provide details about the in-\ntended purpose or extent of surgery\non the breast  therefore we refer to\nall surgical procedures on the breast\nas “surgery ”\n\nWe recorded the age

of regular mammography\nscreening as 2 or more mammo-\ngrams between 9 and 60 months be-\nfore tissue diagnosis during the study\nperiod  with no 2 mammograms per-\nformed within 11 months of each\nother through OBSP or OHIP \n\nSince the decision to proceed with\npercutaneous biopsy may be influ-\nenced by the consulting surgeon or\nthe radiologist reporting the mam-\nmogram results  we also determined\nthe degree of specialization in breast\ndisease of the surgeon s  consulted\nfor patient management and/or the\nradiologist s  reading the mammo-\ngrams  We divided surgeons into\nquintiles in 2 scales based on the\nnumber of patient assessments with a\nbreast-related diagnosis  breast con-\nsultation quintile  or the number of\nsurgical procedures  exclusive of cos-\nmetic procedures  performed on the\nbreast  breast surgery quintile  during\nthe study period  We assigned radiol-\nogists to quintiles in 2 scales based on\nthe number of mammograms read\n mammography quintile  and the\nnumber of image-guided biopsies\nperformed  image-guided biopsy\n\nquintile  during the study period \nWe categorized the women based\n\non the type of procedure they

image-guided\nbiopsy followed by surgery  or\nsurgery without a preoperative per-\ncutaneous biopsy  We compared\nwomen who had any percutaneous\nbiopsy  with or without image guid-\nance  and with or without subse-\nquent surgery  with those whose tis-\nsue diagnoses were confirmed by\nsurgery as the initial procedure  \n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe performed univariate logistic re-\ngression analyses of patient  institu-\ntion and provider variables  We per-\nformed a 2-way analysis of all\nvariable combinations to identify\ninteraction terms  We then de-\nveloped a multivariate logistic regres-\nsion model  To examine variables \nassociated with the use of image-\nguided biopsy rather than FNAB\nwithout image guidance  we per-\nformed a subset analysis of women\nwho had percutaneous biopsies \n\nResults\n\nStudy population\n\nWe identified 3755 women in On-\ntario without a previous diagnosis of\nbreast cancer and who had a percuta-\nneous biopsy and/or breast surgery\nfor the diagnosis and/or treatment\nof a primary breast cancer between\nApr  1  2002  and Dec  31  2002 \nThere were 7368 breast cancer diag-\nnoses in Ontario during the calendar\nyear 2002  Of the women in whom\nbreast cancer was diagnosed during\nthe 9-month study period  we ex-\ncluded 701 women because they had\na previous diagnosis of breast cancer\nor lived in the Southeast LHIN\nwhere physician

margins  However  some have\nsuggested that not all patient popula-\ntions benefit from a preoperative diag-\nnosis  Morrow et al14 found no reduc-\ntion in the number of surgeries\nrequired for definitive therapy among\nwomen who underwent lumpectomy\nalone  women with obviously cancer-\nous mass lesions in whom axillary\nstaging was not planned were able to\nundergo lumpectomy as definitive\nsurgery  With the advent of sentinel\n\nlymph node biopsy for axillary stag-\ning  however  even those with a low\nprobability of axillary metastases\nwould likely undergo this procedure\nat the time of lumpectomy  necessitat-\ning a preoperative diagnosis of inva-\nsive cancer  Facilitation of shared\ndecision-making is another important\nbenefit of preoperative diagnosis \nThus  although the ideal proportion\nof women whose breast cancers\nshould be diagnosed preoperatively is\nunknown  preoperative diagnosis is\n\nlikely to be beneficial for most women \nThe most influential determinant\n\nof the use of percutaneous biopsy for\nbreast cancer diagnosis in Ontario is\nthe LHIN in which the patient re-\nsides  Although our previous study\nsuggested that patient age  urban resi-\ndence and access to a primary care\nprovider affected the probability of\nwomen receiving percutaneous biopsy\nfor the diagnosis of breast abnormal-\nities 17 the observation that patient\ndemographics had no effect on the re-\nceipt of percutaneous biopsy for tissue\ndiagnosis of breast cancer may reflect\nconsistent access to care for patients\nwith urgent conditions in a single-\npayer system that provides services re-\ngardless of individual circumstances \nNonetheless  the variation in the use\nof percutaneous biopsy across LHINs\nsuggests differential availability of\nsome services according to geography \nThe fact that surgeon and radiology\nquintiles are highly correlated with\nLHINs further implies that uneven\ndistribution of surgeons who have\nhigher volumes of patients with breast\nabnormalities or radiologists who per-\nform more image-guided breast biop-\nsies may also account for some of the\nregional variation  Finally  further\nstudy is needed to investigate the pos-\nsibility that the effect of surgeon and\nradiology quintiles  which are highly\ncorrelated with LHINs  on the use of\npercutaneous  particularly image-\nguided  biopsy may be partly attribut-\nable to differing resource allocation\nacross LHINs  The strong preference\nfor surgical biopsy over percutaneous\nbiopsy in LHINs in which the\nmethod of percutaneous biopsy was\nmost likely to be FNAB alone rather\nthan image-guided biopsy supports\nthis hypothesis \n\nAn important finding from our\nstudy was that surgeon and radiologist\nexperience with breast assessment and\nbreast procedures was associated with\nthe use of percutaneous biopsy before\nsurgery and the method of biopsy\nchosen  regardless of the LHIN in\nwhich care was provided  Although

\n\n\n\nand use of percutaneous breast biopsy\nis nonlinear  it appears to be strong \nThe data suggest that there is a thresh-\nold of breast disease volume in a sur-\ngical practice that is associated with\ngreater use of percutaneous biopsy  Be-\ncause the surgeon consultation quintile\nvariable was significantly associated\nwith the use of percutaneous biopsy on\nmultivariate analysis  this effect would\nappear to be real and largely independ-\nent of other variables in our model \nThe reasons for the association cannot\nbe determined by the present study \nbut the observation is hypothesis-\ngenerating \n\nThe opposite effects of radiologic-\nal mammography and image-guided\nbiopsy quintiles on the use of percu-\ntaneous biopsy are apparently para-\ndoxical  but they may be explained\nby the organization of mammog-\nraphy facilities and by practice pat-\nterns  Mammography is performed\nin hospitals and free-standing radiol-\nogy facilities  and through the\nprovincial screening program  Al-\nthough practitioners reading mam-\nmograms outside of hospitals con-\nduct high volumes of screening  they\ndo not necessarily perform breast\nbiopsies  Additional diagnostic evalu-\nation  including further imaging and\nbiopsy  may be performed by a dif-\nferent radiologist at a different facil-\nity  Thus those radiologists who read\nthe most mammograms may be less\nlikely to direct the subsequent diag-\nnostic evaluations than radiologists\nwho read fewer mammograms but\ncoordinate and perform subsequent\nimaging and biopsies  This hypoth-\nesis is supported by the linear rela-\ntion that we observed between radi-\nologist volume and percutaneous\nbiopsy when we sorted the radiolo-\ngists reading the mammograms into\nquintiles based on the volume of\nimage-guided biopsies they per-\nformed  Similarly  the magnitude of\neffect observed with radiologist quin-\ntiles was less than that seen with sur-\ngeon quintiles  probably because of\nthe surgeons’ more direct role in co-\nordinating patient management \n\nOther authors have observed that\nsurgeon experience and volume influ-\nence their adherence to guidelines in\nthe technical performance of cancer\nsurgeries 20–22 To our knowledge  ours\nis the first study to describe an associ-\nation between surgeon or radiologist\nvolume and decision-making about\ndiagnostic approaches  This finding\nmay be particularly relevant to the\nmanagement of breast cancer where\ndiagnostic and treatment options are\nmany  It is likely that radiologists\nwho perform more image-guided\nbreast biopsies would specifically rec-\nommend image-guided biopsies in\ntheir reports of abnormal mammo-\ngrams  presumably the attending\nphysicians who receive these reports\nfrequently follow the recommenda-\ntions  In this way  radiologists familiar\nwith the practice of preoperative\ndiagnosis may influence and guide\nmanagement \n\nAlthough our study could not dis-\ntinguish between FNAB and CNB \nwe were able to differentiate needle\nbiopsies performed with image guid-\nance from those without  The finding\nthat radiologist and surgeon experi-\nence with breast disease and proced-\nures would be associated with in-\ncreased use of image-guided and\nnon–image-guided biopsies respect-\nively may be explained by the fact\nthat image-guided biopsies are per-\nformed by radiologists  whereas\nFNAB without image guidance is\nlikely performed by surgeons  Fur-\nthermore  women aged 50–69 years\nare offered screening through the\nOBSP  which provides specific rec-\nommendations for further investiga-\ntion of abnormal screens  likely ac-\ncounting for the increased use of\nimage-guided biopsy in this age\ngroup and among women whose\nbiopsies were initiated by OBSP\nscreens  Our finding that women\nwith any history of screening mam-\nmography were more likely to have\ntheir cancer diagnosis confirmed\nusing image guidance is consistent\nwith the findings of our earlier study\nindicating that evidence of regular\n\nprimary care and a history of mam-\nmography screening were associated\nwith the use of percutaneous biopsy \nSuch women  particularly those\nscreened through the OBSP  would\nbe more exposed to organized care \nRadiologists with particular experience\nin image-guided biopsies are more\nlikely than others to participate in such\nstandardized processes for breast care \n\nDifferences in availability of pre-\noperative biopsy techniques may ac-\ncount for some of the regional varia-\ntion in their use  Both FNAB and\nimage-guided biopsy require access\nto specialized expertise such as cyto-\npathology  FNAB  and image-guided\nbiopsy techniques  The observations\nthat variation in the use of image-\nguided biopsy is more marked than\nthat in the use of FNAB and that\nFNAB is the predominant technique\nused in LHINs with lower utilization\nrates of percutaneous biopsy for diag-\nnosis further suggest that limited \naccess may play a role in the use of\npreoperative biopsy techniques  Our\nstudy could not determine whether\nvariation in the availability of special-\nized equipment or services such as \ncytopathology and expert breast\npathology  knowledge of current\nrecommendations for preoperative\ndiagnosis of cancer  or other factors\nmay contribute to the irregular appli-\ncation of percutaneous biopsy across\nthe province  however  these import-\nant questions deserve further study \n\nOlivotto and colleagues23 reported\nvariation in the time to definitive\ndiagnosis after an abnormal mammo-\ngram across different parts of British\nColumbia  regardless of whether the\ndiagnosis was confirmed by percuta-\nneous biopsy or surgery  Their results\nindicated that factors other than the\navailability of technology contribute\nto geographic variability in patterns\nof care  Other authors have also\ndescribed regional variation in the\nprovision of treatment for breast

promising tool\nfor the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers  However  most human tumour\nsamples for which long term clinical records are available exist only as formalin-fixed paraffin-\nembedded specimens  Therefore  the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of microRNA\nprofiling studies in routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human breast cancer\nspecimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology \n\nResults  A statistically highly significant correlation  Spearman r  0 78 – 0 90  p < 0 0001  was\nobserved for the expression of 319 microRNAs in routinely processed FFPE breast cancer\nspecimens and paired fresh frozen tissue samples  n = 5  Results were confirmed in a larger series\nanalyzing a selection of 10 microRNAs reported to be deregulated in breast cancer  n = 12  The\nexpression pattern of 3 microRNAs was independently validated in this cohort using real-time RT-\nPCR technology \n\nConclusion  Comprehensive microRNA expression patterns can be reliably derived from\nroutinely processed FFPE breast cancer specimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology \n\nBackground\nFormalin-Fixed  Paraffin-Embedded  FFPE

FFPE\n\nmarkers [2 3]  But the vast majority of published studies\nrely on the analysis of fresh-frozen tissue specimens \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC Biotechnology 2008  8 90 http //www biomedcentral com/1472-6750/8/90\n\nTherefore  several studies have addressed the question of\nmicroRNA expression profiling in FFPE samples  How-\never  the number of routinely processed clinical speci-\nmens analyzed is altogether very low [4-9]  In some\nstudies no fresh-frozen and corresponding archival\nhuman material is analyzed [6] or only from a single\nhuman tissue specimen [4 5]  All these studies made use\nof PCR- or array-based methodologies\n\nThe quantification of microRNA expression levels using\nLNA probes coupled to fluorescence labelled beads offers\nseveral advantages  No amplification step is required\nwhich may introduce a potential bias and the hybridiza-\ntion of probes and target sequences takes place in a homo-\ngeneous system [10] \n\nSo far  no systematic comparison of microRNA profiles\nobtained from fresh-frozen and corresponding FFPE sam-\nples using the fluorescence labelled bead technology is\ndescribed \n\nIn this study we examined the expression pattern of 319\nmicroRNAs in routinely processed formalin-fixed paraf-\nfin-embedded breast cancer specimens and paired fresh-\nfrozen specimens from the very same tumours  For this\npurpose the fluorescence labelled bead technology from\nLuminex  Austin  Texas  USA  was employed \n\nResults\nQuality control of RNA and recovery rate of microRNA\nThe integrity and quality of the RNA preparations was\nanalysed using the microcapillary fluid device form Agi-\nlent  Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer  The mean \"RNA integrity\nnumber\"  RIN [11] for all 12 fresh-frozen breast cancer\nspecimens was 7 65  +/- 0 93  range  5 2 – 8 7  represent-\ning quite faithfully the range of routinely processed tissue\nspecimens with high but not perfect quality of the RNA \nThe highly fragmented RNA from the corresponding for-\nmalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples displayed\na mean RIN of 2 26  +/- 0 28  range  1 6 – 2 5 \n\nThe mean fluorescence intensity  the highest fluorescence\nintensity  and the sum of all fluorescence intensities were\nnot reduced in any of the FFPE samples compared to the\ncorresponding fresh-frozen sample  data not shown \nTherefore  no reduction in microRNA recovery due to for-\nmalin-fixation was observed \n\nComprehensive microRNA expression profiling in paired \nfresh-frozen and formalin-fixed specimens\nThe expression level of 319 microRNAs  FlexMir panel\nversion 8 from Luminex  was measured in 5 fresh-frozen\nbreast cancer specimens and corresponding formalin-\n\nrelation for all 5 paired samples  Fig  1 and Additional\nfiles 1 and 2  The Spearman rank correlation factors were\nbetween 0 6888 and 0 8358  mean  0 789  with p-values\nsmaller than 0 0001 for all sample pairs  two-tailed test \nExcluding all signals below a background corrected mean\nfluorescence intensity of less than 100  arbitrary units of\nthe machine  increased the correlation factors up to\n0 8978  range  0 7789 – 0 8978  mean  0 833  see Fig  S1 \n\nExpression of 10 selected microRNAs in paired fresh-\nfrozen and formalin-fixed specimens\n10 individual microRNAs were selected from the literature\nas most frequently deregulated in primary human breast\ncancer  as at December 2007  see Table 1  for a recent\noverview see also [12] \n\nThe expression level of these 10 microRNAs was measured\nin a series of 12 paired fresh-frozen and FFPE samples  see\nFig  2  Five of these samples were already used for the\nprofiling of 319 microRNAs  see Fig  1  For eight samples\na statistically significant correlation was observed  range\nof correlation factors  0 72 to 0 81  mean  0 77  p < 0 05 \nwhereas for four samples only a trend towards statistical\nsignificance  r = 0 41 to 0 62  was observed  The individ-\nual p-values for all 12 sample pairs are given in Additional\nfiles 3 and 4  Also  the overall pattern of expression is\nsimilar in the four samples without statistical significant\ncorrelation  The same microRNAs are up- or down-regu-\nlated  only the extent of regulation is different  see Addi-\ntional files 3 and 4 \n\nValidation using real-time RT-PCR methodology\nThe expression level of three microRNAs  miR-10b

miR-21  obtained with this com-\npletely different technique is quite similar  The expression\nlevel of miR-145 is only slightly higher than the expres-\nsion level of miR-10b whereas miR-21 is much stronger\nexpressed than miR-10b  see Table 2 \n\nHowever  the extent of overexpression of microRNA 21\nrelative to miR-10b was approx  four fold higher using\nreal-time PCR  mean  approx  170-fold  than using the\nbead-based methodology  mean  approx  40-fold \n\nDiscussion\nThe systematic comparison of paired fresh-frozen and for-\nmalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from the\nvery same tumour shows that reliable microRNA expres-\nsion pattern can be obtained from routinely processed\nbreast cancer specimens using the fluorescence-labelled\nbead-based technology from Luminex  However  a disad-\nvantage of the current microRNA profiling methodology\nfrom Luminex is the requirement of quite large amounts\nof total RNA  2 5 – 5 μg  which is clearly not available for\nevery interesting case \n\nThe much stronger overexpression of miR-21 as measured\nby real-time PCR in comparison to the bead-based meth-\nodology could be due to slight differences in amplifica-\ntion efficiencies for these two microRNAs  These slight\ndifferences in efficiency create a considerable difference in\nexpression level after 25 or 30 cycles due to the exponen-\ntial nature of the amplification process  Additional\nsources of differences between the methods compared are\nthe completely different RNA processing  cDNA synthesis\nversus direct biotin-labelling  and differences in analytical\nsensitivity  which is higher for real-time PCR  But never-\ntheless  the overall pattern is the same using both tech-\nniques \n\nLeaving out all signals below 100 arbitrary units improved\nthe correlation quite significantly for three out of five sam-\nples  clearly indicating that most of the variability\nbetween paired samples are due to fluctuations of the sig-\nnals of very weekly expressed microRNAs \n\nNelson et al  [4] analysed in their pioneering study using\ntheir newly developed assay  \"RAKE\"  among other sam-\nples a single pair of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed mate-\nrial from the same tumour  from an anaplastic\noligodendroglioma  To the best of our knowledge this\nrepresents the very first description of the feasibility of\nlarge-scale microRNA profiling in archival samples  A vis-\nual inspection of Figure 5 from Nelson et al  gives the\nimpression of quite high concordance between the fresh-\nfrozen and the formalin-fixed sample

//www biomedcentral com/1472-6750/8/90\n\nLi et al  [6] published a comparison of microRNA profiles\nfrom snap-frozen cell pellets and formalin-fixed paraffin-\nembedded cell pellets from an immortalized cell line  The\nexpression level of 160 microRNAs was measured using\nquantitative real-time PCR and a very good correlation\nwas observed  However  this very well controlled situation\ndoes not reflect the routine process with all its uncertain-\nties and variability  Also  the fixation process of a tissue\nsample is quite different from the fixation of a cell pellet \n\nXi et al  [7] studied 254 microRNAs using an LNA-probe\narray  Analyzing mouse liver tissue the authors found a\ngood correlation between fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed\nsamples  r2 = 0 86 – 0 89  However  no corresponding\npairs of routinely processed human tissue samples were\nanalyzed  Only a single archival human colon cancer spec-\nimen for which no corresponding fresh-frozen material\nwas available was analyzed \n\nWang et al  [8] mention at the end of the results section\nthe analysis of 5 pairs of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed\nbreast tumours using microarray technology and report\ncorrelation coefficients similar to those described in this\nstudy  r = 0 443 – 0 927  However  they do not show any\nprimary data and do not provide any data about data val-\nidation using a different method \n\nLawrie et al  [5] showed in a supplementary figure the\nanalysis of corresponding fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed\nmaterial from a single lymph node sample using a pub-\nlished microRNA array  Visual inspection of the figure\nshows a good correlation but no formal statistical analysis\nis provided by the authors \n\nThe recently published study from Hoefig et al  [9] repre-\nsents so far the largest direct comparison of microRNA\nexpression patterns obtained from fresh-frozen and corre-\nsponding FFPE samples  4 liver and 7 tonsil specimens \nThe authors used the real-time PCR technology from\nApplied Biosystems for the analysis of 157 microRNAs \nAccording to the authors  the variance caused by formalin\nfixation was much smaller than the variance introduced\nby biological differences  liver versus tonsils  Since the\ncareful data analysis is exclusively based on threshold\ncycle  CT  values and the shift in CT values  a direct com-\nparison with the correlation coefficients obtained by us\nusing a different methodology is not possible  However \nboth technical approaches seem to provide reliable data \n\nFinally  the evaluation of different microRNA isolation\nprocedures recently published by Doleshal et al  [13]  con-\ntains also the comparison of microRNA expression levels\nin paired fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embed-\n\nConclusion\nThe data presented in this study convincingly show that\nroutinely processed human FFPE tissue specimens are\nsuitable for large-scale as well as small-scale microRNA\nprofiling projects using fluorescence labelled bead tech-\nnology  Therefore  this methodology can now be used for\nlarge retrospective studies utilizing stored archival FFPE\nsamples together with the corresponding clinical and his-\ntopathological records \n\nNote added in proof \n\nDuring the revision of this manuscript Zhang et al  pub-\nlished the comparison of microRNA expression patterns\nfrom fresh-frozen and corresponding FFPE lymph node\nspecimens  n = 7  using the Agilent microarray platform\n Agilent  Santa Clara  CA  [14] These authors also found\na very good correlation between measurements of\nmatched fresh-frozen and FFPE samples \n\nMethods\nPatient samples\n12 fresh frozen breast cancer specimens and correspond-\ning formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples\nfrom the very same tumours were retrieved from the\narchives of the Institute of Pathology  Medizinische Hoch-\nschule Hannover in an anonymous fashion following the\nguidelines of the local Ethics committee  Tumour cell con-\ntent was controlled on an HE stained serial section and\nabove 80% for all cases \n\nRNA isolation\nTotal RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen specimens using\nTRIZOL™ reagent  Invitrogen  Karlsruhe  Germany  fol-\nlowing the protocol supplied by the manufacturer  Isola-\ntion of total RNA from FFPE specimens was performed as\ndescribed previously  [15] Following the recommenda-\ntions from Luminex Inc  no microRNA enrichment was\nperformed \n\nRNA quality control\nAn aliquot of 150 ng of every RNA preparation was\nchecked for integrity in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer  Agi-\nlent Technologies  Waldbronn  Germany  Sample prepa-\nration and analysis were performed following the\nmanufacturer's instruction \n\nmicroRNA measurement using fluorescence labelled beads\nQuantification of microRNAs hybridized to fluorescence\nlabelled beads was performed with a BioPlex 200™ from\nBiorad  Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH  München  Ger-\nmany  using the software Luminex IS™  version 2 3 from\nLuminex  Austin  Texas  USA  All beads coated with LNA\nPage 4 of 6\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nded specimens using real-time PCR-based methodology \nbut only for three individual microRNAs \n\nprobes complementary to mature microRNAs were pur-\nchased from Luminex  Austin  Texas  USA \n\n\n\nBMC Biotechnology 2008  8 90 http //www biomedcentral com/1472-6750/8/90\n\nPrior to hybridization total RNA is labelled with biotin\nwhich is later bound to a streptavidin-phycoerythrin con-\njugate  For this purpose the FlexmiR™ MicroRNA Labeling\nKit from Luminex was used  For the comprehensive profil-\ning of 319 microRNAs  FlexmiR™ human microRNA pool \nversion 8  2 5 μg total RNA were labelled  for the analysis\nof 10 selected microRNAs  FlexmiR™ Select  0 5 μg were\nlabelled following the protocol provided by the manufac-\nturer  Subsequent washing  hybridization and analysis of\nsamples were performed exactly as described in the proto-\ncols provided by Luminex \n\nThe system was calibrated using the xMAP™ calibration\ncontrol reagents from Luminex following the recommen-\ndations of the manufacturer  Every run contained a nega-\ntive control for background subtraction  water instead of\nRNA  and a positive control  total human brain RNA\nfrom Ambion  provided by Luminex  For data normaliza-\ntion the background value for every individual microRNA\nbead was subtracted from every corresponding measure-\nment  Subsequently  all corrected mean fluorescence\nintensities were normalised to pool 1 using the average\ncorrection factor for the four normalization controls\nincluded in all five pools as recommended by the manu-\nfacturer  The 319 different microRNA beads are divided\ninto 5 pools because there are not enough different fluo-\nrescence labels available to distinguish more than 70 – 80\nbeads in a single tube  These normalised net mean fluo-\nrescence intensities were directly compared between\npaired samples  All control and normalization beads\n which are identical in the five different pools  were left\nout for these comparisons \n\nmicroRNA measurement using real time-RT-PCR \ntechnology\nFor the measurement of the expression levels of selected\nmicroRNAs  hsa-mir-10b  -21  -145  the real time-RT-\nPCR-based detection methodology from ABI  Darmstadt \nGermany  was used  Relative expression levels were calcu-\nlated using the constitutively expressed small RNAs\nRNU24 and Z-30 as endogenous controls  All primers and\nprobes were purchased from ABI  cDNA synthesis and\nreal-time PCR were performed following the protocols\nsupplied by the manufacturer \n\nStatistical analysis\nThe distribution of the microRNA expression data did not\npass the test for normality  α = 0 05  for any specimen \nTherefore  Spearman rank correlation factors were calcu-\nlated  two-tailed  For all calculations the software pack-\nage GraphPad

expression\nanalysis was shown to elucidate the biological variance between tumors and molecular markers were\nidentified that led to new classification systems that provided better prognostic and predictive parameters \nArchived FFPE samples represent an ideal source of tissue for translational research  as millions of tissue\nblocks exist from routine diagnostics and from clinical studies  These should be exploited to provide\nclinicians with more accurate prognostic and predictive information  Unfortunately  RNA derived from\nFFPE material is partially degraded and chemically modified and reliable gene expression measurement has\nonly become successful after implementing novel and optimized procedures for RNA isolation \ndemodification and detection \n\nMethods  In this study we used tissue cylinders as known from the construction of tissue microarrays \nRNA was isolated with a robust protocol recently developed for RNA derived from FFPE material  Gene\nexpression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR \n\nResults  Sixteen tissue blocks from 7 patients diagnosed with multiple histological subtypes of breast\ncancer were available for this study  After verification of appropriate localization  sufficient RNA yield and\nquality  30 tissue cores were available for gene expression measurement on TaqMan® Low Density Arrays\n 16 invasive ductal carcinoma  IDC  8 ductal carcinoma in situ  DCIS  and 6 normal tissue  and 14 tissue\ncores were lost  Gene expression values were used to calculate scores representing the proliferation\nstatus  PRO  the estrogen receptor status and the HER2 status  The PRO scores measured from entire\nsections were similar to PRO scores determined from IDC tissue cores  Scores determined from normal\ntissue cores consistently revealed lower PRO scores than cores derived from IDC or DCIS of the same\nblock or from different blocks of the same patient \n\nConclusion  We have developed optimized protocols for RNA isolation from histologically distinct areas \nRNA prepared from FFPE tissue cores is suitable for gene expression measurement by quantitative PCR \n\nPublished  25 November 2008\n\nBMC Cancer 2008  8

cancer are still mainly\nbased on clinical  histological and immunohistochemical\nparameters  which are at best semi-quantitative [1 2] \nRecently  molecular characterization of breast cancer has\ngreatly increased the understanding of biological path-\nways that are altered during neoplastic transformation \nMolecular markers have a great impact on elucidating the\nbiological variance within tumors  they allow new and\nmore accurate classifications and they have the potential\nto improve diagnosis  estimation of prognosis and treat-\nment decisions in individual patients [3-6] \n\nMost gene expression studies are based on fresh frozen\nmaterial which  in most instances  is not readily available \nas surgical samples are usually fixed in formalin  Unfortu-\nnately  RNA derived from formalin-fixed  paraffin-embed-\nded  FFPE  material is considerably fragmented and\nchemically modified  often impairing gene expression\nmeasurement using standard procedures  We developed a\nsimple and robust protocol for RNA isolation and partial\nde-modification from standard FFPE sections and docu-\nmented that the isolated RNA is suitable for gene expres-\nsion measurement by quantitative reverse transcription\nPCR  QRT-PCR  [7 8]  However  RNA isolated from tissue\nsections may not be representative for a tumor as the pro-\nportion of normal tissue in a section may be significant \nTo circumvent this problem  we used tissue cores as pre-\npared for the construction of tissue microarrays  TMA \nTMAs allow to analyze hundreds of archival tissue sam-\nples simultaneously [9]  For a TMA  individual cores are\npunched from representative areas of a large series of FFPE\ntissue blocks and re-assembled on a single recipient paraf-\nfin block  Sections from TMA blocks are processed by\nstaining  immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization\nlike regular tissue sections  revealing results from up to\n1000 individual tissue cores present on a single array\n[10 11] \n\nWe used such tissue cores as source of material for RNA\nisolation  In contrast to sections which represent all tissue\ntypes present in the block  tissue cores have the great\nadvantage that they can be taken very precisely from the\narea of interest within an individual tissue block [12 13] \nIn the present study  tissue cores were taken from normal\nand cancerous tissue of the same block and gene expres-\nsion was measured  We compared the level of expression\nof various genes between invasive ductal carcinoma\n IDC  ductal carcinoma in situ  DCIS  and regions of his-\ntologically normal breast epithelium in single tissue\nblocks \n\nMethods\nTissue specimens and generation of tissue cores\nBreast cancer specimens from 7 patients diagnosed with\nductal carcinoma were retrieved from the files of the Insti-\ntute of Pathology  University of Bern  Tissue samples were\nfixed with 4% neutralized formalin and embedded in par-\naffin  Sections from each of a total of 16 tissue blocks  1\nto 4 blocks per patient  were stained with hematoxylin\nand eosin and regions containing IDC  DCIS and normal\nbreast epithelium were marked on each slide and the cor-\nresponding paraffin block  Fig  1A and 1B  Three to 5 tis-\nsue cores were punched from each area of interest  1 to 5\nareas in each block  using a manual tissue microarrayer\n Beecher Instruments  Sun Prairie  WI  USA  In total  3 to\n5 tissue cores were taken from 44 individual areas  Cylin-\nders had a diameter of 0 6 mm and the length of the cores\nvaried between 1 and 3 mm resulting in approximately\n0 3 to 1 mg tissue per core  Fig  1E  After taking tissue\ncores  RNA was isolated from five 10 μm thick serial sec-\ntions that were collected from each tissue block at several\nlevels separated by 400 μm  Tissue was evaluated by\nhematoxylin and eosin staining of sections at each level\nand the localization of tissue cores was verified micro-\nscopically within tumor and normal tissue  Fig  1C and\n1D  Six tissue cores were excluded from further experi-\nments because they did not represent tissue from the\nappropriate area of interest  Histopathological

metastasis  circulating tumor cells\n\nIntroduction\nRecent studies show that entry of tumor cells into the circulation and subsequent metastasis\noccur early in breast cancer progression  1 2  Although effective detection of “rare” tumor\ncells  a few CTCs in 1-mL of blood  remains technically challenging  populations of CTCs \nidentified by various technologies focusing on the epithelial cell surface marker EpCAM  also\nknown as ESA/Epi/TADST   3 4  have been shown to correlate with cancer progression  5 \n6  Likewise  CTC detection based on multiple epithelial lineage mRNAs using sensitive PCR-\nbased molecular assays  7 8  appear useful for establishing clinical correlations with early\nbreast cancer prognosis \n\nTumor cells expressing invasive phenotypes lose many types of epithelial antigens in a\ntransformation process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition  EMT   9-11  The transition \nwhich occurs early in cancer progression  involves tumor progenitor  TP  cells with stem/\ninvasive cell properties  12 13  Such cells may enter the circulation to generate multiple\npopulations of CTCs with specific phenotypes  2 4  that could contribute to aggressive growth\nof tumor cells in the lung and to early metastatic colony formation  14 15  However  the\nmajority of current technologies for CTC detection involve either use of antibody against\nEpCAM for complex analytic approaches such as immuno-affinity micropost  CTC-chip™ \nor immuno-magnetic particles  CellSearch™  or multiplex qPCR approaches for tumor-\nassociated mRNAs  5 6  Low EpCAM expression by hematopoietic micrometastases has been\nreported  and attempts to isolate CTCs using antibodies against EpCAM result in loss of most\nof the CTCs in some cases  16-19  In addition  whether the epithelial cells isolated by these\nmethods exhibit the invasive phenotype and express stem cell markers is not well understood \n\nSince the proclivity of a tumor cell to invade collagenous matrices is one of the hallmarks of\nmetastasis  20 21  we hypothesized that populations of CTCs that adhere and invade\ncollagenous matrices would be invasive and exhibit the propensity of progenitor cells to\nmetastasize  We reasoned that an enrichment step based on function of invadopodia  which are\nsubcellular structures involved in cell invasion into collagenous matrices  22 23  would serve\nto separate CTCs from the majority of cell types found in the blood  Recently  we demonstrated\nthe principle that metastatic tumor cells derived from peritoneal effusions of ovarian cancer\npatients were invasive when in contact with collagenous matrices  24  We further developed\nCTC enrichment and identification prototypes using collagen adhesion matrix  CAM  for uses\nin cellular analysis of ovarian cancer  25  and molecular analysis of prostate cancer  26  The\nCAM-coated prototypes enrich tumor cells in blood and peritoneal fluid based on their unique\navidity to the CAM enabling sensitive cellular and molecular analyses of ovarian and prostate\ncancers  A particular feature is that CAM surfaces allow direct assessment of tumor cell\ninvasiveness by their ability to remove and ingest CAM fragments  called CAM uptake  and\nfacilitate an independent means of identifying a tumor cell using the CAM uptake criterion \n\nConsidering the wide range of sensitivity  0 7-176 CTCs per mL of blood  and yields\n 14-100%  of CTC detection in patients with metastatic breast cancer  5 6  in this study we\naimed   a  to determine if the CAM method generates an effective and sensitive detection of\nCTCs in breast cancer  and  b  to examine if populations of CTCs with novel phenotypic\nexpression exist  The CAM method achieved effective enrichment and identification  and\nsuccessfully detected CTCs in whole blood of an experimental setting in 18 of 18  100% \nsamples and that of metastatic breast cancer patients in 10 of 10  100%  samples  with a range\n\nLu et al  Page 2\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2010 March 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

circulating\nepithelial cells with the collagen-invasive phenotype in early stage breast cancer patients  We\ndemonstrate that the relative frequency of invasive CTCs correlates to the staging  lymph node-\nstatus and survival of patients with early stage breast cancer  CAM-captured cells derived from\nblood of breast cancer patients are capable of propagation in culture  Concomitantly  we\nshowed by gene expression profiling that CAM-enriched circulating cells retained the\nexpression of distinct sets of epithelial and tumor progenitor or EMT stem cell  CD44 and\nTWIST1  genes  Furthermore  we showed by multiplex fluorescent activated cell sorting\n FACS  that CAM-captured CTC populations consist of epithelial lineage cells  Epi+ cell \nEpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  and tumor progenitor cells  TP+ cell \nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  in which 50-75% of the two populations overlap  Epi+TP+ cell \nCD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  We conclude that the CAM method may provide an\neffective novel tool for sensitive identification and characterization of subtypes of CTCs in\npatients with breast cancer \n\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients and clinical samples\n\nThis study was conducted at Stony Brook

in\nage  surgery type  tumor histology or grade  ER/PR/Her-2 status  including 10 triple negative\npatients  or type of chemo received between the two groups \n\nCTC detection rates varied significantly by stage  most Stage III breast cancer patients  86 4% \nhad at least one detectable CTC  while only about 27 3% of Stage I patients  and 28 6% of\nStage II patients had detectable CTCs  Fig  3-a  p-value 10 CTCs/mL detected  Their mean disease-free survival was 8 5\nmonths  range 1-19 months  Mean follow-up of patients with >10 CTCs/mL who had no\ndisease recurrence/progression was 21 5 months  range 1-83 months \n\nA significant decrease in overall survival from breast cancer-related deaths was seen in patients\nwith CTC counts >10 CTCs/mL  Fig  4-b  p-value=0 04  All patients who had ≤10 CTCs/mL\nwere alive at the end of the study and had a mean follow-up time of 28 5 months  range 1-84\nmonths  Furthermore  all 3 deaths occurred in the CTC-high group  >10 CTCs/mL  who\ndemonstrated a mean overall survival of 13 3 months  range 5-25 months  The mean follow-\nup of patients with >10 CTCs/mL who were alive was 19 5 months  range 5-83 months \nAnalyses comparing disease-free survival and overall survival between CTC-negative and\nCTC-positive patients was also performed which revealed similar trends  although they did not\nreach statistical significance  data not shown \n\nMolecular phenotyping of circulating cells isolated by CAM from breast cancer patients\nTo examine that cells isolated by CAM are viable  cells of the MNC fraction  pre-CAM  and\ncaptured by Vita-Assay™  post-CAM  were stained using a LIVE/DEAD viability kit  Fig  5-\na b  A mixture of live green fluorescent cells and dead red fluorescent cells in the MNC\nfractions was seen prior to CAM enrichment but reduced dead red cells in post-CAM fraction\n Fig  5-a  Dead red fluorescent cells were frequently seen in the MNC fractions  Fig  5-b  Pre-\nCAM  66%±2% viable  mean±SE  n=10  but dead red fluorescent cells were quite infrequent\nafter CAM enrichment  Fig  5-b  post-CAM  99 9%±0 1% viable  n=10  p>0 0001  indicating\nthat CAM enrichment returns nearly 100% viable circulating cells \n\nTo determine the ability of circulating cells isolated by CAM from breast cancer patients to\npropagate into the epithelial phenotype in vitro  we cultured the cells on the same CAM\nsubstrata  Freshly isolated circulating cells locally degraded the underlying CAM and exhibited\nCAM uptakes within one day of culture  Fig  5-c  large white arrows  This was not observed\nfor hematopoietic cells captured by CAM  Fig  5-c  small arrows  The number and size of\ncells increased over time in culture  resulting in sizeable colonies within 10 days  Fig  5-d \nlarge white arrows pointing to round cells  and large spread cells with epithelial morphology\nafter 20 days  Fig  5-d  open white arrows pointing to spread and large epithelial cells  whereas\nco-purified hematopoietic cells were observed to reduce their number  Fig  5-d  red arrows \nThese results indicate that the CTC phenotype includes the ability to propagate and progress\nto tumor cell morphology \n\nTo examine if markers known to express in breast tumors could be found in certain populations\nof the circulating cells isolated by CAM from breast cancer patients  we performed gene\nexpression

leukocytes  per mL of blood from nine breast cancer patients and none tumor cells\nfrom 7 healthy women  blood sample set A  and subjected blood samples to the one-step CAM\nmethod  Vita-Cap™   b  We then used the RNA extracted from CAM-enriched cells from\ncancer patients and compared it with RNA extracted from CAM-enriched cells from healthy\nwomen to generate gene expression profiles of cancer-associated genes and to subtract genes\nupregulated in the “normal” leukocyte cells captured by CAM  Comparative gene expression\nprofiling was performed using the Affymetrix HG_U133_Plus_2 chip  containing 54 675 gene\nprobes  47 000 transcripts and variants  After a global scaling procedure was performed to\nnormalize the expression data between experiments  we screened >1 000 genes  a fold-change\n>2 at a probability  1 000 genes that were significantly upregulated in cancer samples\n for potential tumor markers  as well as 11 epithelial lineage markers  known to express in\nepithelial tumors  and leukocyte adhesion receptors  as internal marker controls  from the\ngenechip  Figs  6-a  6-b  and supplementary Table 1S  to examine differential expression of\nselected genes in cancer and normal samples \n\nUpregulation of these selected genes in cancer samples was determined in both the training set\nof blood samples  blood sample set A  that consists of 7 normal and 9 breast cancer samples\n Fig  6-a  and the testing set  blood sample set B  that consists of 9 normal and 20 breast cancer\nsamples  Fig  6-b  In cancer samples that contained >60 CTCs/mL blood  the four cytokeratin\ngenes  KRT8  KRT16  KRT17 and KRT19  and eight tumor-associated genes  TERT  MUC16/\nM17S2/CA125  CD44  TWIST1  TACSTD1/EpCAM/CD326/ESA/HEA125/GA733  DPP4/\nCD26  ESR1 and PGR  were upregulated  whereas the 3 internal control genes  ITGA2 \nCD14 and ITGB3  and the six breast tumor genes  VIM  MUC1  ERBB2  CD24  EGFR and\nDPP5/FAP/seprase/APCE  exhibit no specific expression  Figs  6-a  6-b  and supplementary\nTable 1S  The expression data strongly suggest that circulating cells enriched by CAM from\ncancer samples are heterogeneous and contain subpopulations that express specific epithelial\nlineage  stem or progenitor markers \n\nTo examine whether distinct populations of circulating cells isolated by CAM exist  multiplex\nfluorescent activated cell sorting  FACS  of CAM-captured cells was performed  The\nfollowing four-five marker combinations were used to sort individual epithelial  Epi  and tumor\nprogenitor  TP  cells   a  Epi+ cell – EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−   b  TP+ cell –\nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  and  c  Epi+TP+ cell – CD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD− \n\nMultiplex FACS was used to sort the circulating cells pre-enriched by CAM into homogeneous\ncells using the five markers  in which EpCAM and CD44 are for positive selection  but CD34\nand CD45  both conjugated with APC  negatively sort out hematopoietic cells and 7AAD to\nexclude dead cells  Fig  7  FACS gating for specific expression of Epi and TP markers in\ncancer samples includes the use of circulating cells captured by CAM from normal blood\nsamples as the baseline measurement  so that we obtain a cutoff value of ≤5 Epi+ and TP+ cells/\nmL in control normal blood samples  Fig  7-d  e and f  Consistently  >5 Epi+  TP+ and\nEpi+TP+ cells/mL were identified in the blood samples from breast cancer patients  Fig  7-a \nb and c  A single-cell-sorted Epi+ cell is identified as a EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD− cell\nin blood samples  Fig  7-a and d  number of cells/mL in red  TP+ cell is

could be discriminated from co-purifying circulating\nhematopoietic stem cells and leukocytes that were CD34+CD45+ and from dead cells that were\n7AAD+  The latter demonstrates that both CAM-enrichment of viable cells and 7AAD\nexclusion of dead cells are crucial to achieve accuracy  as the remaining dead cells show high\n\nLu et al  Page 9\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript

results demonstrate that CAM enrichment\nof circulating cells and multiplex flow cytometry provide a powerful opportunity for\nphenotyping of different populations of circulating tumor cells in cancer patients \n\nDiscussion\nCurrent approaches to enrich or sort tumor cells from the peripheral blood for CTC detection\ninvolve the use of a few epithelial lineage markers in specialized methods and devices  These\napproaches include Ficoll density gradient centrifugation-imaging system  28  flow cytometry\n 29  immunomagnetic particle-imaging system  CellSearch  30  microfluidic imaging\nsystem  CTC chip  31  high-throughput optical-imaging system  32  and fiber optic array\nscanning  33  CellSearch detects CTCs based on a cell enrichment step using anti-EpCAM\nantibodies and tumor cell identification using cytokeratin  KRT8  KRT18 and KRT19 \nexpression  30  and is currently the lead technology approved by FDA for use in the clinical\nsetting  Using similar antibodies to enrich and cytokeratin expression to identify tumor cells \na recent report showed that CTC chip detected one to two orders of magnitude more CTCs  79\n±52 cells/mL  from metastatic breast cancer patients than CellSearch  31  However  there is\nno conscience how to compare CTC detection between these two methods and others  since\nblood samples and modes of cell enrichment and antigens used in other analytic approaches\nsignificantly differ  6 \n\nFor example  the CAM-initiated CTC detection method reported here reveals 126±25  mean\n±SD  cells/mL blood from metastatic breast cancer patients that are CAM+Epi+  i e  cells with\ndetectable expression of upregulated TACSTD1/EpCAM/ CD326/ESA/ HEA125/GA733 and\nKRT-4 5 6 8 10 13 18 antigens  as well as invasive/progenitor cell properties  EpCAM and\ncytokeratin expression is an essential positive selection criterion in major CTC detection\nmethods  However  the CAM method identifies the cell invasiveness simultaneously while\nrecognizing epithelial lineage antigens  Figs  1-2  suggesting that the assay selects a\nsubpopulation of epithelial cells that invades the extracellular matrix  Like disseminated tumor\ncells in bone marrow isolated by the Ficoll density gradient centrifugation method  34  CAM-\ncaptured cells are capable of propagation in culture  Fig  5 \n\nAlthough HER2  ER and PR are considered as important breast tumor markers  our\nimmunofluorescent assay for CTC identification  involving CAM  Epi and CD45  did not find\ncorrelations between the expression of HER2  ER and PR in primary tumors and levels of\nCTCs detected  Table 1  However  we showed by Affymetrix DNA microarray profiling of\ncirculating cells isolated by the single step Vita-Cap™ method  Fig  6  that some known breast\ntumor markers  including CD44  TACSTD1/EpCAM  TERT  MUC16/CA125  DPP4/CD26 \nESR1/ER and PGR/PR  are likely upregulated in specific populations of the circulating cells\ncaptured by CAM from cancer blood samples  whereas others  including MUC1  VIM  DPP5/\nFAP and ERBB2/Erb-2/HER2  are also expressed in un-identified populations of CAM-avid\ncells in normal blood samples  Considering that HER2  ER and PR are important therapeutic\ntargets for breast cancer  it will be interesting to investigate which populations of circulating\ncells enriched by CAM that express these targets in patients during therapeutic intervention \n\nExpression profiling of CAM-captured cells from breast cancer patients indeed shows the\nupregulation of mRNAs reflective of multiple populations of CTCs  To validate this concept \nwe showed by multiplex FACS  Fig  7  that CAM-captured circulating cells from breast cancer\npatients consisted of three distinct populations  epithelial lineage cells  Epi+ cell \nEpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  and tumor progenitor cells  TP+ cell \nCD44+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  in which 50-75% of the two populations overlap  Epi+TP+ cell \nCD44+EpCAM+CD34−CD45−7AAD−  Thus  the CAM method could detect at least three\nsubpopulations of invasive CTCs with epithelial  progenitor and epithelial/progenitor\n\nLu et al  Page 10\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2010 March

sample showing\nthat CAM+Epi+ cells substantially overlapped with Epi+TP+ cells \n\nIn spiking model experiments we found that the CAM method is about 100-times more\nsensitive than the epithelial cell immuno-magnetic isolation to detect MDA-MB-231 tumor\ncells spiked in whole blood  Fig  1-a  Previous reports showed that  when cells derived from\ndifferent tumor cell lines were used to perform epithelial cell capture using specific antibodies\nfor the initial cell enrichment  the spiked tumor cells were recovered with different rates  30 \n31  Specifically  the CAM method enriched MDA-MB-231 tumor cells spiked in whole blood\nto the extent that were readily detected by fluorescence microscopic assay for epithelial markers\n EpCAM  ESA and cytokeratins  but CellSearch™ that targeted on EpCAM for the initial cell\nenrichment could not detect any MDA-MB-231 cells that had low EpCAM expression on the\ncell surface  4  However  the CellSearch™ test could effectively detect other tumor cell types\nthat expressed high EpCAM on the cell surface  4  Thus  commonly used antibody-based cell\nenrichment methods such as the CellSearch™ test are effective to detect specific populations\nof CTCs that express targeted antigens  whereas the CAM method is efficient in the recovery\nof rare circulating cells that have strong avidity to the ECM to enable immuno-phenotyping of\nmultiple populations of CTCs \n\nWe have made an attempt to compare capture efficiency of tumor cells spiked in the “model”\nblood using a one-step CAM enrichment  Fig  1-a  WB Vita-Cap™  and a two-step method\n Fig  1-a  MNC-1 Vita-Assay™  in which the blood samples were pre-processed using Ficoll\ndensity gradient centrifugation  Original tumor cell dose spiked in whole blood was determined\nby first removing their red blood cells using a red cell lysing buffer  and measuring by FACS\nin a Trucount tube  BD Biosciences  We found that there is 30-40% cell loss in the MNC\nfractionation that generates a recovery rate of 77 3%±7 1%  n=9  Fig  1-a  MNC-1 Vita-\nAssay™  of tumor cells with the two-step CAM method  Fig  1-a  In comparison  the one-\nstep CAM method has recovery rate of 46 8%±12 2%  n=9  Fig  1-a  WB Vita-Cap™  Fig  1-\na  We also found that the level of CAM+Epi+ cells resolved with the two-step CAM method\ncorrelates with expression profiling of circulating cells isolated by the single step Vita-Cap™\nmethod  Fig  6  that retain the upregulated expression of epithelial lineage  KRT8  KRT16 \nKRT17  KRT19  TERT and MUC16/M17S2/CA125  and EMT stem cell  CD44 and TWIST1 \ngenes  Together  these results suggest that pre-processing of blood samples is not necessary\nfor CAM procedures \n\nIn this study  we also investigated the prognostic value of epithelial cells with the invasive\nphenotype present in peripheral blood of patients with early stage breast cancer  We reason\nthat detection of these invasive CTCs may offer an alternative method to assess metastatic\nprogression that may be of prognostic value  We demonstrated that invasive CTCs were\ndetected in 52% of patients with stage I-III breast cancer and the CTC counts significantly\ncorrelated with advanced stage disease  lymph node status  shorter disease-free survival and\nshorter overall survival  Also  we documented the decreased disease-free survival  p-value\n0 005  and overall survival  p-value 0 04  in early stage  stages I-III  breast cancer patients\nwho had ≥10 CTC counts per mL of blood  The cut-off value is higher than that of commonly\nused methods  We could explain that these circulating cells might represent subpopulations of\n“normal-like or stem” cells  which are yet to develop their aggressive behavior and could not\nbe detected by other commonly used methods  Nevertheless  our findings indicate that as breast\ncancer progresses  a greater number of invasive CTCs are present \n\nCTCs  as defined by cytokeratin  CK  positivity and CD45 negativity  are detected in metastatic\nbreast cancer patients and their higher number is related with worse disease-free and overall\nsurvival in these patients  35  Although the clinical significance of CTCs in patients with early\nstage breast cancer  28 36  was not found using the CK+CD45− criterion  similar studies using\n\nLu et al  Page 11\n\nInt J

molecular assays  7 8  showed encouraging clinical correlations  The\ndetection of CTCs by PCR using CK19 and MGB1 mRNA before adjuvant chemotherapy\npredicts poor disease-free survival in women with early breast cancer  7  Also  the detection\nof CTCs by PCR using stanniocalcin-1  STC-1  N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase\n GalNacT  and melanoma antigen gene family-A3  MAGE-A3  offers a novel means to assess\nthe presence of systemic disease spreading relative to lymph node status  8  Although the\ncellular origin of these mRNAs remains unknown  their findings that high blood mRNAs\ncorrelate with poor disease-free survival and lymph node status are similar to ours using the\ncellular assay  Nevertheless  CTCs can be reliably detected by the use of multiple mRNA\nmarkers  as used in these molecular assays \n\nIn summary  the CAM method is unique in the CTC field for the detection of epithelial and\ntumor progenitor cells with the invasive phenotype in blood  and it warrants further clinical\nstudies to evaluate the value of invasive CTCs in guiding therapy for patients with early stage\nbreast cancer \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed

\nMechanistically  we found that either pamidronate or clodronate did not affect mRNA expression\nof HIF-1α  but apparently promoted the degradation of IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein  Meanwhile \nwe found that the presence of pamidronate and clodronate led to a dose-dependent decease in the\nnewly-synthesized HIF-1α protein induced by IGF-1 in breast cancer cells after proteasomal\ninhibition  thus indirectly reflecting the inhibition of protein synthesis  In addition  our results\nindicated that the inhibitory effects of bisphosphonates on the HIF-1α/VEGF axis are associated\nwith the inhibition of the PI-3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways  Consistently  we demonstrated\nthat pamidronate and clodronate functionally abrogated both in vitro and in vivo tumor\nangiogenesis induced by

bisphosphonates in the inhibition of tumor\nangiogenesis in breast cancer cells \n\nKeywords\nbisphosphonates  breast cancer  IGF-1  HIF-1α  VEGF  PI-3K/Akt  angiogenesis\n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is the leading cancer affecting millions of women worldwide with aggressive\nosteolytic bone metastases in the advanced diseases 1  2 and longstanding morbidity or\nskeletal complications  including bone pain  pathological fracture  hypercalcemia  spinal\ncord or nerve root compression syndrome 3\n\nBisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of inorganic pyrophosphate  containing a\nphosphorus-carbon-phosphorus  P-C-P  backbone and variable side chains that determine\nthe specific potency for inhibition of bone resorption 4 5 Bisphosphonates that lack a\nnitrogen functional group in the R2 side chain  such as clodronate  condense with an\naminoacyladenylate to form nonhydrolyzable analogues of ATP that inhibit ATP-dependent\nintracellular enzymes 6  7 On the other hand  nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates  NBPs \nsuch as pamidronate  inhibit the activity of farnesyl diphosphate synthase  a key enzyme in\nthe mevalonate pathway 6  7 Due to their potent anti-resorptive activity  some\nbisphosphonates  clodronate  pamidronate  ibandronaye  zoledronate  have emerged in\nrecent years as a highly effective therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of\nskeletal complications secondary to bone metastases 5  7  8\n\nAside from the anti-resorptive activity  bisphosphonates also exhibit potent antitumor\neffects  both in vitro and in vivo 9 via several mechanisms including inhibition of tumor cell\nadhesion to bone 10 tumor cell invasion 11 12 proliferation  survival and apoptosis 11–16 as\nwell as enhancement of the tumoricidal effect of various anti-neoplastic agents 11  17\nMoreover  bisphosphonates have been reported to suppress tumor angiogenesis by directly\nsuppressing endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation  decreasing capillary-like tube\nformation  and inhibiting the formation of blood vessels in several animal models 11  18–21\nThese findings  together with recent reports that bisphosphonates altered circulating\nangiogenic factors in metastatic breast cancer patients 22 23 suggest that bisphosphonates\nare also potent anti-angiogenic agents  However  the underlying mechanism by which\nbisphosphonates suppress tumor angiogenesis remains largely unknown \n\nCentral to cellular response to hypoxia is the increased expression and activity of hypoxia-\ninducible factor  HIF -1α  which regulates a large subset of target genes essential for cellular\nadaptation to low oxygen conditions 24  25 Under normoxic condition  HIF-1α is modified\nat the proline residues  pro564 and pro402  by prolyl hydroxylases  interacts with the von\nHippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein  VHL  a recognition component of an E3\nubiquitin-protein ligase  and is targeted for proteosomal degradation 26  27 However  under\nhypoxic condition  HIF-1α protein is stabilized through the inactivation of an oxygen-\ndependent HIF-1α-prolyl hydroxylase 26 27 and translocates to the nucleus where it\ndimerizes with HIF-1β unit  In addition to intratumoral hypoxia  HIF-1α activity is also\nfrequently upregulated in several cancers in response to a variety of non-hypoxic signals\nincluding

in breast cancer after conventional adjuvant therapy 48  49–\n52 Increased HIF-1α activity has been shown to enhance the invasiveness and osteolytic\nbone metastases of breast cancer cells 44 53 and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic\ndrugs 54  55 Therefore  inhibition of HIF-1α activation using a variety of small molecules\ncan regulate tumor growth and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy

activity in a variety of types of cancer 33–35  63 including breast cancer cells 64  65\nThese findings suggest that IGF-1/HIF-1α pathway might be a promising molecular target\nfor chemoprevention and treatment of breast cancer \n\nIn the present study  we investigated the effects of clodronate  a non-nitrogen containing\nbisphosphonate  and pamidronate  a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate  on IGF-1-induced\nHIF-1α and VEGF gene expression in estrogen receptor  ER -positive human breast cancer\ncells  MCF-7  We found that both clodronate and pamidronate specifically inhibited IGF-1-\ninduced HIF-1α protein level by accelerating its protein degradation  In addition \nbisphosphonates suppressed VEGF expression in MCF-7 cells by interfering with PI-3K/\nAKT/mTOR signaling pathways  Functionally  these bisphosphonates abrogated IGF-1-\nstimulated formation of capillary tube-like structures in vitro and tumor angiogenesis in\nvivo  These results suggest a potent

pretreatment with PD98059  a specific\ninhibitor of ERK1/2  showed no obvious effects on IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein\naccumulation and VEGF protein secretion  data not shown \n\nPrevious studies have shown that IGF-1-mediated activation of PI-3K/Akt is essential to\nregulate HIF-1α protein synthesis via activation of several protein translational regulators \nincluding mTOR  p70S6K  and 4E-BP1 63  68 Thus  we next investigated the effects of\nbisphosphonates on the protein translational machinery  Our results showed that IGF-1\nstimulated activation of mTOR  p70S6K  and 4E-BP1 in MCF-7 cells in a time-dependent\nmanner  Fig  3a  and treatment with pamidronate or clodronate strikingly inhibited IGF-1-\ninduced activation of mTOR  p70S6K  and 4E-BP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner\n Fig  3b  Consistent with above findings  clodronate demonstrated a stronger inhibitory\neffect on IGF-1-induced activation of mTOR and 4E-BP-1 than pamidronate\n Supplementary Fig  2b and 2d  To further confirm these results  we pretreated serum-\nstarved MCF-7 cells with rapamycin  a specific inhibitor of mTOR  followed by exposure to\nIGF-1 for 16 hours  As expected pretreatment with rapamycin significantly suppressed\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation  Fig  3c  and VEGF secretion  Fig  3e \nP<0 01  Collectively  these results suggest that pamidronate and clodronate inhibited\nIGF-1-induced HIF-1α accumulation and its downstream target gene  VEGF  possibly by\ninterfering with PI-3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways that play a pivotal role in the protein\ntranslational machinery 29  31  39  46\n\nBisphosphonates inhibited IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation in MCF-7 cells by\npromoting HIF-1α protein degradation\n\nTo further explore the molecular mechanisms whereby pamidronate and clodronate inhibit\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation  we observed their effects on the degradation\nkinetic of HIF-1α protein in response to IGF-1 stimulation in MCF-7 cells  To this end \nserum-starved MCF-7 cells were exposed to IGF-1 for 16 hours followed by treatment with\nCHX to block ongoing protein synthesis in the presence or absence of bisphosphonates for\ndifferent time periods  Our results showed that pamidronate and clodronate promoted the\ndegradation of IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein as compared with that treated with CHX alone\n Fig  4 b & 4c versus Fig 4a  The estimated half-lives of IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein are\n25 45 min and 37 48 min in MCF-7 cells treated with pamidronate and clodronate \nrespectively  as compared to 83 01 min in the absence of bisphosphonates  whereas\npamidronate appeared to have a stronger effect in promoting the degradation rate than\nclodronate  Fig  4d  These findings indicate that pamidronate and clodronate reduce IGF-1-\ninduced HIF-1α protein accumulation  at least in part  by accelerating its degradation or\nreducing its stability in MCF-7 cells \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that HIF-1α protein is rapidly degraded under normoxic\nconditions mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome system26  27 and the accumulation rate of\nHIF-1α protein due to proteasomal inhibition indirectly reflects the synthesis rate of the\nprotein 26  56–58 To determine whether bisphosphonates could also affect the synthesis of\nHIF-1α protein  experiments with the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 were performed\nas previously described56–58  To this end  MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 20 µmol/L of\nMG-132 for 30 min followed by incubation with IGF-1 for 6 hours in the presence or\nabsence of pamidronate or clodronate  Our results showed that in the absence of IGF-1 \ntreatment with MG132 alone led to an increase in the ubiquitinated fraction of HIF-1α\nprotein  but only a slight increase in the 120 kDa HIF-1α protein level  Fig  4e  lane 2  As\npostulated  the increased levels of the newly synthesized 120 kDa HIF-1α protein induced\nby IGF-1 significantly

IGF-1-induced HIF-1α\nprotein accumulation possibly by increasing the rate of its degradation and/or decreasing the\nrate of its synthesis in MCF-7 cells \n\nBisphosphonates inhibited tumor angiogenesis stimulated by IGF-1 both in vitro and in\nvivo\n\nIGF-1 has been reported to promote tumor angiogenesis in several cancer cells 34  35\nConsistent with previous findings  our results showed that conditioned media derived from\nIGF-1-treated MCF-7 cells were capable of stimulating capillary tube-like structures by\nHUVEC on Matrigels  Fig  5a  panel IV  Fig  5b  We next asked whether the IGF-1 induced\nangiogenic effect would be suppressed by treatment with bisphopshonates  Our data showed\nthat pretreatment with 50µmol/L of pamidronate or clodronate abrogated tubule formation in\nboth IGF-1 treated or untreated conditioned media exposed endothelial cells  Fig  5a  panels\nV and VI vs IV  Fig  5b \n\nTo further determine the effect of bisphosphonates on MCF-7 cells-induced tumor\nangiogenesis in vivo  we performed Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in nude mice  a\ncommonly used in vivo model to test the antiangiogenic effects of compounds or drugs 66\nOur results showed that Matrigel plugs mixed with the untreated conditioned medium did\nnot induce angiogenesis  Fig  6a-I  showing barely detectable or low hemoglobin levels\n Fig  6b  However  stimulation with IGF-1 greatly enhanced MCF-7 cell tumor\nangiogenesis  Fig  6a-V vs Fig  6a-II  shown here as a 20-fold higher hemoglobin levels in\nthe angiogenic plugs as compared to control  P < 0

decreased the\nhemoglobin levels  P < 0 01  Fig  6b  but had no obvious effect on unstimulated tumor\ninduced blood vessel formation  Fig  6a-V and Fig  6b  We also found that IGF-1\nsignificantly increased HIF-1α protein expression in MCF-7 xenografts  Fig  6c-III vs Fig \n6c-I  which was drastically attenuated in the presence of clodronate  Fig  6c-IV vs Fig  6c-\nIII  Similar findings were observed in MCF-7 cells treated with pamidronate  data not\nshown  Taken together  our results indicated that clodronate and pamidronate exert their\nanti-angiogenic effects possibly via disrupting HIF-1α/VEGF pathway that plays an\nimportant role in tumor angiogenesis 25  35  43  66\n\nDiscussion\nNumerous studies have suggested that IGF-1/IGF-1R-mediated activation of downstream\nsignaling pathways play an important role in mammary tumorigenesis and progression of\nbreast cancer 59–62 However  due to the heterogeneity of breast tumor cells  either ER-\npositive or ER-negative  response to IGF-1 stimulated growth varies with cell types59  It\nappears that the altered response to IGF-1 stimulation might be due to the different\nexpression levels of IGF-1-associated signaling molecules  For instance  previous studies\nhave demonstrated that ER-positive IGF-1-responsive breast cancer cells  like MCF-7 \nexpress relatively higher levels and activation of IGF-R1 than ER-negative IGF-1-\nunresponsive breast cancer cells  like MDA-MB-468 59 Meanwhile  as compared to MDA-\nMB-468 cells  ER-positive MCF-7 cells displayed higher levels of endogenous insulin\nreceptor substrates  IRS 59 which play a central role in IGF-1/IGF-R1 activated\ndownstream signaling pathways 69 These findings provide a possible explanation that IGF-1\nsignificantly enhances HIF-1α protein accumulation in ER-positive MCF-7 cells  but not in\n\nTang et al  Page 9\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2011 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA

protocol has incorporated bisphosphonates in the treatment and\nprevention of skeletal complications secondary to bone metastases in breast cancer 5–8 In\naddition to their antiresorptive effects  bisphosphonates have also been shown to have direct\nand indirect antitumor activities through a variety of mechanisms9–17  including their\npotential anti-angiogenic activities 11  18–21 However  it is of note that there are\ndiscrepancies and even controversial reports between structurally different non nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates in terms of their\nefficacy in reducing cell viability/anti-proliferation and/or apoptosis induction in cancer\ncells 12–16 For instance  several studies have shown that as compared with nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates such as pamidronate and alendronate  clodronate  a non\nnitrogen-containing bisphosphonate  displayed the least 15  16 and under certain conditions \neven no obvious 12 anti-proliferative and apoptotic inductive activity in breast cancer cells \nOn the contrary  in the present study we found that clodronate reduced the cell viability and\nabrogated IGF-1-stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells more than pamidronate\n Supplementary Figure 1  This is in consistent with a previous report by Fromigue et al that\nclodronate exhibited stronger antagonizing effects than pamidronate on the stimulatory\neffects of several growth factors  including IGF-1  on the proliferation of breast cancer cells \n13 Such discrepancies between non nitrogen-containing and nitrogen-containing\nbisphosphonates in terms of their efficacy in reducing the cell viability/anti-proliferation of\ncancer cells may possibly due to the different mechanisms of pharmacological actions7 and\ndifferent cell contexts and experimental conditions 12–16 Therefore  the detailed\nmechanisms warrant further investigation \n\nIn addition to the anti-tumoral activities of both non nitrogen-containing and nitrogen-\ncontaining bisphosphonates  accumulating evidence has shown that these compounds also\npossess potent anti-angiogenic effects both in vitro and in vivo 18–23 In agreement with\nthese findings  our present study also showed that both clodronate and pamidronate\ndramatically suppressed both in vitro and in vivo tumor angiogenesis induced by MCF-7\ncells in response to IGF-1  Fig  5  Fig  6  However  up to date the underlying molecular\nmechanisms remain largely unknown  Because VEGF  as a potent mediator of new blood\nvessel formation or angiogenesis that plays a pivotal role in the growth and metastasis of\ncancer24  25  72  can be induced either by hypoxia or non-hypoxic stimuli via\ntransactivation of the major hypoxia-responsive transcription activator  HIF-1α 28  31  63 \n68 then we further explored whether bisphosphonates could disrupt this pro-angiogenic\npathway in breast cancer cells  As postulated  we demonstrated for the first time that both\nclodronate and pamidronate indeed significantly inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation\n Fig  1  Fig  6c  and VEGF expression in ER-positive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in\nresponse to IGF-1 stimulation  Fig  2  Our findings suggest that disruption of HIF-1α/\nVEGF axis might contribute  at least in part  to the anti-angiogenic activity of\nbisphosphonates \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that a variety of small molecules and compounds inhibit\nhypoxia- or growth factor-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation through stimulating the\ndegradation and/or decreasing the synthesis rate of the protein 35  56–58 We then\ninvestigated the potential molecular mechanisms whereby pamidonate and clodronate inhibit\nIGF-1-upregulated HIF-1α protein accumulation in breast cancer cells  Firstly  we\ndemonstrated that treatment of MCF-7 cells with clodronate or pamidronate had no obvious\neffects on the expression of HIF-1α mRNA  Fig  1d  suggesting that both drugs inhibit\nHIF-1α protein accumulation at the translational and/or post-translational levels  Secondly \nwe tested whether bisphosphonates could affect the degradation of HIF-1α protein  and we\n\nTang et al  Page

both clodronate and pamidronate could significantly speed the degradation rate of\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein  whereas pamidronate appeared to possess stronger effects\nthan clodronate in this regard  Fig  4a~d  In addition  because rapid degradation of HIF-1α\nprotein occurs under normoxic conditions mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway 26 \n27 the accumulation rate of HIF-1α protein due to proteasomal inhibition indirectly reflects\nthe synthesis rate of the protein 26  56–58 We subsequently observed the effects of\nbisphosphonates on IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation in breast cells after\ntreatment with MG132  a specific proteasomal inhibitor  Our data showed that the presence\nof clodronate or pamidronate led to a dose-dependent decrease in the newly-synthesized 120\nkDa HIF-1α protein levels induced by IGF-1 in cells after proteasomal inhibition    whereas\nclodronate appeared to be more potent than pamidronate  Fig  4e and 4f  Even though\npamidronate and clodronate exhibited a different degree of efficacy in stimulating the\ndegradation and decreasing the synthesis of HIF-1α protein  the overall net inhibition of\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation caused by clodronate was more pronounced\nthan that by pamidronate  Fig  1  Such differences in the efficacy of clodronate and\npamidronate in reducing IGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation may reflect their\ndifferent molecule structures and mechanisms of pharmacological actions 7  12–26\nHowever  further investigation was required to address the mechanism in detail \n\nSeveral lines of evidence have shown that an increased HIF-1α protein accumulation\ninduced by non-hypoxic stimuli such as oncogenic activation  cytokines and growth factors\nincluding IGF-1 is mainly due to an increased HIF-1α protein synthesis 28–35 whereby\nPI-3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways play a pivotal role 28  29  31  32  43  46 Then we\nalso explored whether bisphosphonates had any effect on these signaling pathways  We\nfound that bisphosphonates significantly inhibited IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of\nAKT  mTOR  p70S6K1 and 4E-BP1  Fig  3b  all of which compromise essential\ncomponents of the protein translational machinery cascades 70  71 Correspondingly \ntreatment of MCF-7 cells with wortmannin  a specific inhibitor of PI-3K  or rapamycin  a\nspecific inhibitor of mTOR  drastically inhibited IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein\naccumulation and VEGF expression  Fig  3c~3e  Collectively  these findings suggest that\nthe mechanisms by which clodronate and pamidronate inhibit IGF-1-induced HIF-1α protein\naccumulation may involve  at least in part  the disruption of PI-3K/AKT/mTOR signaling\npathways and translational machineries  Recently  Han et al reported that PI-3K/Akt\npathway does not play a major role in protecting IGF-1-induced HIF-1α from degradation\nmediated by SCH66336  a farnesyltransferase inhibitor 35 Therefore  further studies are\nrequired to validate whether PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathways are directly involved in\nbisphosphonate-mediated increased degradation and reduced synthesis of IGF-1 induced\nHIF-1α protein in breast cancer cells \nIn summary  in the present study we have demonstrated  to our knowledge for the first time \nthat clodronate and pamidronate inhibited in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis mediated by\nIGF-1 stimulated breast cancer cells possibly through the inhibition of IGF-1-induced\nHIF-1α protein accumulation and VEGF expression  Meanwhile  our studies imply that the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of clodronate and pamidronate on\nIGF-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation might involve simultaneous inhibition of\nHIF-1α protein synthesis and enhancement of its degradation  Therefore  our findings have\nhighlighted an important mechanism of the pharmacological action of bisphosphonates in\nthe inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer cells

2009\n\nAbstract  The safety of silicone-based implant for mammoplasty has been debated for decades  A series of anec-\ndotal case reports and a recent epidemiological case-control study have suggested a possible association between \nsilicone implant and the development of primary breast ALK1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma  ALCL  a \nrare type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma  In this report  we describe an additional case of primary breast ALK1- \nnegative ALCL in the fibrous capsule and cystic fluid of silicone breast implant in a 58 year old woman who under-\nwent breast reconstructive surgery after lumpectomy for her infiltrating breast adenocarcinoma  Morphologically \nand immunohistochemically  the lymphoma cells may be confused with recurrent infiltrating breast adenocarcino-\nma or other nonhematolymphoid malignancies  Molecular studies were needed to determine T-lineage differentia-\ntion of the malignant lymphoma cells  We will also review the case reports and case series published in the English \nliterature and discuss our current understanding of silicone implant in primary breast ALK1-negative ALCL \n\nKey words  Breast implant  silicone  anaplastic large cell lymphoma  ALK1  ALCL\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrimary breast lymphoma is uncommon  compris-\ning less than 1% of all primary breast malignan-\ncies and about 2% of all extranodal nonHodgkin \nlymphomas [1  2]  The majority of primary breast \nlymphomas are of B-cell origin  including diffuse \nlarge B-cell lymphoma  marginal zone B-cell lym-\nphoma  follicle center cell lymphoma and other \nB-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [1-3]  Primary \nbreast T-cell lymphoma is even rarer  comprising \nless than 10% of all primary breast non-Hodgkin \nlymphomas [1  2  4]  In fact  in a recent study by \nLin YC et al  there was no single case of primary \nbreast T-cell lymphoma in one of the largest series \nreported from Taiwan [5] \n\nSilicone-based implant for breast augmentation \nis primarily used in women for cosmetic purpose  \nIt has also been used in patients after lumpecto-\nmy or mastectomy for breast cancer [6]  The safe-\nty of this procedure has been debated for decades  \nparticularly its association with connective tissue \ndisorders  In the last decade or so  attention has \nbeen shifted to the long term effect of silicone \nimplant on cancer development  A single epide-\nmiological study reported an increased risk of \n\ncancer death among women with silicone breast \nimplants compared with women in the general \npopulation [7]  Several large epidemiological stud-\nies  however  have subsequently shown no evi-\ndence of increased risk of developing malignancy \nin the breast or other tissues after breast aug-\nmentation with silicone implant  perhaps with the \nexception of lung cancer [8-10]  \n\nALK1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma \n ALCL  is a rare peripheral T-cell lymphoma  \nAnecdotal case reports and a recent large retro-\nspective epidemiological case-control study from \nSweden have raised concern of silicone implant \nin the development of lymphoma [4  11-21]  Here \nwe describe another case of primary breast \nALK1-negative ALCL in association with silicone \nbreast implant and review the literature to dis-\ncuss our current understanding of silicone \nimplant in primary breast lymphomas \n\nReport of a case\n\nThe patient was a 58 year old woman with a \nhistory of small infiltrating ductal carcinoma \n less than 5 mm in maximum diameter  of her \nleft breast diagnosed in November 2002  She \n\n\n\nSilicone implant and primary breast anaplastic large cell lymphoma\n\n118 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2010 3 1 117-127\n\nstaging bone marrow biopsy was negative for \ninvolvement by malignant lymphoma or meta-\nstatic disease  She was treated with 6 cycles of \nCHOP  cyclophosphamide  adriamycin  vincris-\ntine and prednisone  and had no evidence of \ndisease 10 months after treatment  \n\nunderwent lumpectomy followed by treatment \nwith tamoxifen and cosmetic breast reconstruc-\ntive surgery with a silicone-based saline-filled \nimplant  About five and a half years following \nthe surgery  she was found to have left breast \nswelling with a painless mass  Magnetic reso-\nnance imaging  MRI  of the chest showed fluid \ncollection around her implant \n\nFine needle aspiration of the fluid around the \nbreast implant showed large atypical mono-\nnuclear cells with irregular nuclear contours and \nprominent nucleoli in a background of small lym-\nphocytes  Figure 1A  suspicious for recurrence of \nthe patient’s infiltrating ductal carcinoma  The \nimplant was then surgically removed and submit-\nted for pathological examination  The implant was \ngrossly intact surrounded by a fibrous capsule  \nSections of the cell block from the fine needle \naspiration and the fibrous capsule both demon-\nstrated the presence of large atypical mononucle-\nar cells forming cohesive clusters  Figures 1B and \n1C  again raising the diagnostic consideration of \nrecurrent breast adenocarcinoma \n\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed on \nthe cell block as well as the seroma  The  atypical \nmononuclear cells were positive for CD30  but \nnegative for CD3  CD20 and CD45  Figure 2  \nEpithelial membrane protein  EMA  was also posi-\ntive  data not shown  The malignant cells are neg-\native for keratin  AE1/AE3  S100  CD68  HMB45  \nCD5  CD79a  CD138  kappa  lambda  and ALK  \nFluorescence in situ hybridization studies with the \nALK breakapart probe was also negative for ALK \ngene rearrangement  data not shown  Even \nthough immunostain for keratin was negative  the \npossibility of recurrent breast adenocarcinoma \ncannot be completely excluded because of the \npatient’s history and lineage non-specificity of \nCD30 and EMA  Therefore  molecular studies were \nperformed and the results demonstrated mono-\nclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma \ngene without evidence of monoclonality of B cells \n Figure 3  The morphologic  immunohistochemi-\ncal and molecular findings support a diagnosis of \nALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma aris-\ning in association with silicone breast implant \nrather than  recurrent infiltrating breast cancer or \nother nonhematolymphoid malignancies  \n\nPhysical examination and computerized \n tomography scans showed no evidence of \nlymphadenopathy or organomegaly  A complete \nblood count with differential was normal  A \n\nFigure 1  Cytological and histological features \nof the primary

or without a \nmass lesion  with seroma as the most common \npresentation  This unusual presentation indi-\ncates the importance of careful pathological \nexamination of tissues removed for implant-re-\nlated complications  In implant-associated pri-\nmary breast ALCL  both sides are equally affect-\ned  which is different from the reported \npredilection for involvement of the right breast \nby other types of primary breast lymphomas  \nThe age of patients with implant-related ALCL \nranged from 24 to 87 years  and lymphoma \ndeveloped 1 to 23 years after mammo plasty sur-\ngery  Slightly more than half of the procedures \nwere performed for cosmetic reason  while the \nremainders were for breast cancer  Table 1  \n\nThe lymphoma cells in primary breast ALCL with \nor without association of silicone implant were \nmorphologically similar  The lymphoma cells \ndemonstrate bulky eosinophilic to amphophilic \ncytoplasm  and the nuclei are large and pleo-\nmorphic with vesicular chromatin and promi-\nnent nucleoli  Figure 1  Mitoses are frequently \nseen  and the proliferation index in cases \nassessed with Ki6-7 is high  >80% in the cases \nexamined  Like nodal ALCL  these cells tend to \nform cohesive sheets in the fibrous capsule of \nthe silicone implant  mimicking invasive carci-\nnoma  Horseshoe-like hallmark cells may also \nbe seen  There was no skin involvement in all \nreported cases  The lymphoma cells are also \npresent in the fluid collection surrounding the \nintact or leaky implant  \n\nImmunohistochemically  primary breast ALCL \ncells are uniformly and strongly positive for  \nCD30 with both membrane and Golgi staining \n Figure 2  and are mostly positive for EMA in the \ncases evaluated  Most cases demonstrated \nexpression of at least one T-cell marker  such as \nCD3  CD4  CD5  CD7 or CD43  a feature that can \nbe used to distinguish ALCL from recurrent infil-\ntrating breast adenocarcinoma and other non-\nhematolymphoid malignancies  TIA1  cytotoxic \ngranule protein  is positive in a subset of cases \nexamined  However  molecular studies to demon-\nstrate clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor \ngene are essential to confirm the diagnosis  \nExcept for one  all primary breast ALCL demon-\nstrated clonal rearrangement of the T-cell recep-\ntor gene in the cases analyzed  Figure 3  \nImmunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrange-\nment is not present  ALK1 expression was absent \nin all ALCL associated with silicone breast implant \n\ntissue disorders because implant recipients \nproduced autoantibodies against silicone  \n\nThe risk of developing cancer in breast and \nother tissues has been the focus of attention \nthe last decade or so because a retrospective \nepidemiological study reported a higher risk of \ncancer-related death among women with sili-\ncone breast implants compared with women in \nthe general population [7  8]  However  subse-\nquent large epidemiological studies demon-\nstrated no evidence of increased cancer risk in \nassociation with silicone breast implant  In fact  \nthe standard incidence rate for breast cancer is \nlower in silicone breast implant recipients than \nin the general population [9  10]  There might \nbe a slightly increased risk of lung cancer in the \nrecipient population  which may have been \nrelated to other factors such as history of smok-\ning and urban indwelling environment rather \nthan silicone breast mammoplasty per se  \n\nThe possible association between silicone \nimplant and primary breast nonHodgkin lympho-\nma was first suggested by Duvic et al in 1995 \n[24]  The authors reported three cases of cutane-\nous T-cell lymphoma  CTCL  in association with \nbreast implant  However  CTCL is such a common \ncutaneous lymphoma that reporting of 3 cases \namong the more than 1 million breast implant \nrecipients could have been coincidental  \n\nALK1-negative ALCL is a rare peripheral T-cell \nlymphoma and a provisional entity in the most \nrecent WHO classification of hematolymphoid \nneoplasms  The first case of ALCL in associa-\ntion with a saline-filled breast implant was \nreported by Keech and Creech in 1997 [14]  \nThe patient was 41 year-old white female who \ndeveloped ALCL 5 years after cosmetic silicone \nbreast augmentation for postpartum mammary \nhypoplasia  ALK1 expression was not described  \nShe was successfully treated with chemothera-\npy without evidence of recurrent disease  \nAmong the 30 cases of primary breast ALCL \nreported in the English literature so far  22 of \nthem were associated with silicone-based \nimplant  including the case reported here and \none large series from Sweden  Table 1  \n\nPrimary breast lymphoma typically presents with \na mass lesion  including primary breast ALCL not \nassociated with silicone implant  Most patients \nwith primary breast ALCL associated with sili-\ncone implant  however  presented

is unknown  Chemotherapy \nfor breast cancer has been shown to increase \nthe risk of secondary cancer development  \nsuch as Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloid neo-\nplasm  Less than half of the silicone-associated \nprimary breast ALK1-negative ALCL had the \nmammoplasty performed after lumpectomy or \nmastectomy of breast cancer  It is unlikely that \nthese lymphomas are due to chemotherapy for \nthe underlying breast cancer  Silicone has been \nshown to incite chronic inflammatory response \nwith production of autoantibodies  Since  chronic \ninflammation has been associated with devel-\nopment of malignant lymphomas  such as H  \npylori infection in gastric extranodal marginal \nzone lymphoma and hepatitis C infection in \nmarginal zone B-cell lymphoma  it is possible \nthat chronic inflammatory stimulation may be \nrelated to the increased risk of development of \nprimary breast ALK1-negative ALCL in silicone \nimplant recipients  \n\nIt should be noted the wide range of odds ratio in \nthe retrospective case control study by de Jong \net al [23]  5 of the 11 primary breast ALK1-\nnegative ALCLs had no history of silicone breast \nimplantation [23]  One of the patients developed \nALCL 1 year after cosmetic implantation  These \nfacts also raise the possibility of random asso-\nciation between silicone implant and primary \nbreast ALK1-negative ALCL  Further studies are \nnecessary to confirm or repute the causal asso-\nciation between silicone implant and primary \nbreast ALK1-negative ALCL  Laboratory investi-\ngation is also needed to identify the underlying \nmolecular mechanism  particularly the role of \nchronic inflammatory stimulation in lymphom-\nagenesis  if the association does exist \n\nPlease address all correspondences to

with primary breast ALCL \nassociated with silicone implant  Table 1  Most \nof these patients received chemotherapy with \nor without radiation therapy  Some patients \nwere followed with observation only after remov-\nal of the seroma and silicone implant  Except for \none with recurrent disease 12 months later  all \npatients were in remission without disease dur-\ning the follow-up period  suggesting a relatively \nindolent disease of primary breast ALCL associ-\nated with silicone implant  \n\nALCL with secondary breast involvement has \nalso been reported  Talwalkar et al described 2 \nALK1-negative ALCL with secondary involve-\nment of the breast [2]  One patient had a history \nof lymphomatoid papulosis and classical \nHodgkin lymphoma  When breast involvement \nwas diagnosed  the patient had systemic involve-\nment of skin  lung  lymph node and bone \n marrow  The patient died 36 months after the \ndiagnosis  The second patient had a history of \ncutaneous ALCL before developing ALK1-\nnegative ALCL of the breast  She was alive with-\nout evidence of disease with 5 months of follow-\nup  Interestingly  both cases were associated \nwith silicone breast implant  They also reported \n4 cases of ALK1-positive ALCL with secondary \nbreast involvement  and none of these 4 cases \nwere in association with breast implant  \n\nThough primary breast lymphomas are most \ncommonly of B-cell origin  only three B cell lym-\nphomas have been described in association \nwith breast implant  These are follicular lympho-\nma [25]  primary effusion lymphoma [26]  and \nlymphoplasmacytic lymphoma [27]  There was \nno single case report of primary breast diffuse \nlarge B-cell lymphoma arising in association \nwith breast implant  If the association between

silicone mammoplasty since silicone \nimplant has been widely used and ALK-negative \nALCL is such an uncommon lymphoma \n\nIt appears that silicone implant may play a role \nin the development of

has led to new\n\nhypotheses about tumor progression  Cancer stem cells can divide\n\nasymmetrically to self-renew and generate transient-amplifying\n\ntumor cells that cause tumor formation and subsequent metastasis \n\nThus  within the population of cancer cells  cancer stem cells are the\n\nones which can form new tumors and their asymmetric division\n\ncontributes to tumor heterogeneity  It has been reported that cancer\n\nstem cells are present in acute myelogenous leukemia  AML  [1] as\n\nwell as many solid tumors [2–9] including breast tumors [10]  It has\n\nbeen demonstrated that leukemia stem cells are heterogeneous in\n\nterms of their origins [11] and different leukemia stem cells can give\n\nrise to different types of leukemia [12 13]  However  it is not fully\n\nknown whether heterogeneous cancer stem cells exist in the many\n\ntypes of solid tumors and how this heterogeneity may affect\n\ntreatment response of these cancers \n\nOf the many types of breast cancers  approximately 80 percent are\n\ninvasive ductal carcinomas  and 10–15 percent are invasive lobular\n\ncarcinomas  Additional rare types constitute less than 5–10 percent of\n\nbreast cancers  Gene expression profiling can further classify invasive\n\nductal carcinomas into five subtypes  luminal A  luminal B  ERBB2\n\n human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER2  basal and\n\nnormal-like [14–17]  One fundamental question that needs to be\n\naddressed is whether these different subtypes of breast cancers are\n\nderived from different lineage origins  Differing cancer stem cells in\n\neach type may explain why they differ in degree of metastasis and\n\ninvasion  as well as prognosis outcome and treatment response  It is\n\nthus essential to identify and characterize these cancer stem cell\n\npopulations in order to establish the origin and optimal treatment\n\nstrategy of each breast cancer subtype  see [18] for review \n\nBreast cancer stem cells have been isolated from human breast\n\ntumors or breast cancer-derived pleural effusions using flow\n\ncytometry to find subpopulations of cells with a specific pattern of\n\nPLoS ONE | www plosone org 1 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8377\n\n\n\ncell surface markers  CD44+  CD242/low  ESA+  epithelial specific\n\nantigen  but lacking expression of specific lineage markers  Lin2 \n\n[10]  These cells expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition\n\n EMT  markers [19] and had higher tumorigenic potential than\n\nbulk tumor cells after transplantation in nonobese diabetic/severe\n\ncombined immunodeficient  NOD/SCID  mice [10 19]  It has also\n\nbeen shown that single cell suspensions of CD44+CD242/lowLin2\n\ncells from human breast cancers were able to proliferate extensively\n\nand form clonal nonadherent mammospheres in a low attachment\n\nin vitro culture system [20]  These mammospheres were more\n\ntumorigenic than established breast cancer-derived cell lines\n\nincluding MCF-7 and B3R [20] \n\nAdditional markers useful in characterizing breast cancer stem\n\ncells were recently reported [21–23]  PROCR  identified using\n\ngene expression profiling of primary breast cancers [22]  is also a\n\nknown marker of hematopoietic  neural  and embryonic stem cells\n\n[24]  An additional marker  CD133  was identified for breast\n\ncancer stem cells isolated from cell lines generated from\n\nBrca12exon11/p53+/2 mouse mammary tumors [23] and is a\n\nknown marker of cancer stem cells in several organs including\n\nbrain  blood  liver and prostate [2 3 25 26]  A more recent study\n\nshowed that aldehyde dehydrogenase  ALDH  was increased in a\n\nsubpopulation of both normal and cancerous human mammary\n\nepithelial cells that exhibit stem/progenitor cell properties  This\n\nsubpopulation is tumorigenic  capable of self-renewal  and able to\n\ngenerate tumors that had the heterogeneity of the parental tumor\n\n[21]  Other surface markers such as CXCR4 and ABCG2 may be\n\nassociated with cancer stem cell characteristics  CXCR4 is a G-\n\ncoupled heptahelical receptor contributing to metastasis in breast\n\ncancers [27]  ABCG2 is one of the ABC transporters which has\n\nbeen detected in known stem/progenitor cells such as hemato-\n\npoietic stem cells [28]  nestin-positive islet-derived progenitors [29]\n\nand neural stem cells [30]  Although each of these markers has\n\nbeen studied individually  they have not been used together to\n\ndetermine the overall marker profile of individual tumors and the\n\npossible heterogeneous origins in tumors \n\nTo address this fundamental question  we first performed cancer\n\nstem cell marker profile analysis using human breast cancer cell\n\nlines and specimens to further define and characterize different\n\nstem cell populations by flow cytometry  along with in vitro and in\n\nvivo assays to verify the stem cell properties of different cell isolates \nOur results showed that  1  the expression of stem cell markers\n\ndiffered greatly among breast cancer cell lines as well as primary\n\ntumors  2  the previously recognized markers for breast cancer\n\nstem cells may not be the optimal or universal markers for\n\nidentifying cancer stem cell populations  and 3  a highly\n\ntumorigenic subpopulation expressing PROCR+/ESA+ was iden-\n\ntified  Furthermore  this subpopulation was able to divide\n\nasymmetrically both in vitro and in vivo  and expressed EMT\nmarkers  These results suggest existence of multiple subpopula-\n\ntions of breast cancer stem cells  as in the case for leukemia \n\nResults\n\nBreast Cancer Cell Lines Heterogeneously Expressed\nStem Cell Markers\nTo examine the expression profile of cancer stem cell markers in\n\nbreast cancer cell lines  we selected eight known stem cell markers\n\nand performed FACS analysis in eight human breast cancer cell\n\nlines  Table 1  Among those markers  CD44 was expressed mostly\n\nin basal-like cell lines including MDA-MB-468  MDA-MB-231 \n\nand HCC1937  while CD24 was expressed in luminal-like cell\n\nlines such as T47D  MCF-7  ZR-75  and SKBR-3  ALDH\n\nexpression was observed in most of the cell lines and not associated\n\nwith specific cell types  Although it has been reported that HER2\n\noverexpression could drive tumorigenesis and ALDH expression\n\n[31]  our cell line data did not support such a relationship  This\n\nwas consistent with the human specimen data described below\n\nwhich showed no strong relationship between HER2 and ALDH\n\nexpression  Specifically  SKBR-3 and MDA-MB361 both ex-\n\npressed HER2 but differed in ALDH expression  PROCR was\n\nexpressed only in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 and luminal-\n\nlike MDA-MB-361 cells  While ABCG2 was not expressed in all\n\ncell lines except a few MCF-7 cells  high level of CD133 was\n\ndetected in almost all MDA-MB-468 cells  but not in other cell\n\nlines  Furthermore  only a small portion of ZR-75 cells  but not\n\nothers  expressed CXCR4  while ESA was expressed in all the cell\n\nlines  but the level was relatively low in MDA-MB231  Table 1 \n\nThese data suggest that human breast cancer cell lines express\n\nstem cell markers heterogeneously and likely contain different\n\ntypes of cancer stem/progenitor cells \n\nCD44+/CD242/low and ALDH Are Not the Universal\nMarkers for Isolation of Cancer Stem Cells with High\nEfficiency of Colony Forming Ability\nThe hallmark of cancer stem cells is that one or very few cells\n\nare capable of forming tumor in animal assay  To accelerate the\n\nselection procedure for identification of stem cells  we sought to\n\nuse anchorage-independent growth in soft agar culture since it best\n\nmimics tumorigenic ability in animal  Although mammosphere\n\nformation has served as an in vitro stem cell criteria  not every\n\nbreast cancer cell line posses such ability [32 33]  Based on cell\n\nsurface markers listed in Table 1  the bulk cells were labeled with\n\nantibodies specifically against the selected stem cell markers  sorted\n\ninto two separate groups using fluorescence activated cell sorting\n\n FACS  and subjected to soft agar colony formation assays\n\n Figure 1  If the selected markers effectively identified cancer stem\n\ncells  it would be expected that the marker-expressing subpopu-\n\nTable 1  Different human

on this premise  we have analyzed five cell lines including\n\nZR-75  HCC1937  SKBR-3  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-361 \n\nConsistent with previous reports [21 34]  ZR-75 cells sorted by\n\nALDH+ were negatively associated with ER expression  Figure S1 \n\nMethod S1  but exhibited higher colony forming ability than the\n\nbulk cells or ALDH2 cells  Figure 1A  However  if sorted by\n\nCXCR4+  the subpopulation exhibited less efficiency in colony\n\nforming ability when compared with the ALDH+ subpopulation\n\n Figure S2  Method S1  suggesting that the ALDH+ subpopulation\n\nmay contain more cancer stem/progenitor cells of the ZR-75 cell\n\nline  The subpopulation of HCC1937 cells sorted by CD44+/\n\nCD242/low formed more colonies than the bulk cells  Figure 1B \n\nbulk vs  CD44+/CD242  However  the remaining subpopulation \n\nwhich was not CD44+/CD242/low  also formed colonies more\n\nthan the bulk cells and showed a better efficiency than the CD44+/\n\nCD242/low cells  Figure 1B  This suggested the existence of\n\nanother stem cell population  which was not CD44+/CD242/low \n\nFurther selection with ALDH marker from HCC1937 cells failed\n\nto enrich a subpopulation with higher colony forming ability\n\n Figure S2  Method S1  Similarly  the subpopulation sorted by\n\nALDH+ from SKBR-3 cells showed less efficiency in colony\n\nformation than the bulk and the ALDH2 cells  Figure 1C  Taken\n\ntogether  these results suggested that CD44+/CD242/low and\n\nALDH may not be universal markers to identify and enrich highly\n\ntumorigenic stem cells from all breast cancers  Instead  there may\n\nbe other types of breast cancer stem cells that are defined by other\n\nmarkers \n\nPROCR+/ESA+ Enriched a Subpopulation of Breast Cancer\nCells with High Colony Forming Efficiency in Soft Agar\nIt was noted that in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-361 cell\n\nlines  almost all cells  $90%  were CD44+/CD242/low  However \nless than five and twelve percent of the cells were able to form\n\ncolonies in soft agar  respectively  Figure 1D and 1E  bulk cells  In\n\nMDA-MB-231  the sorted PROCR+/ESA+ cells showed a two-\n\nfold and nine-fold increase in colony forming efficiency when\n\ncompared with that of the bulk cells and PROCR2/ESA2 cells \n\nrespectively  Figure 1D  suggesting that the PROCR+/ESA+\n\nsubpopulation may be comprised of a higher number of stem/\n\nprogenitor cells than the PROCR2/ESA2 cells \n\nSince more than 85–90% of MDA-MB-361 cells expressed\n\nCD44 and ESA  Table 1  PROCR alone was used to evaluate\n\nwhether a high tumorigenic subpopulation can be enriched in this\n\ncell line  A two-fold higher colony forming efficiency was observed\n\nin PROCR+ cells when compared with the bulk cells or the\n\nFigure 1  Soft agar colony

PROCR marker alone may\n\nnot be the optimal selection of the stem/progenitor cells from this\n\ncell line \n\nPROCR+/ESA+ Subpopulation Cells Were Highly\nTumorigenic In Vivo\nTo test whether the selected PROCR+/ESA+ MDA-MB-231\n\ncells form tumors  we injected 100  500 and 2500  respectively \n\nPROCR+/ESA+ MDA-MB-231 cells into the mammary fat pad of\n\nNOD/SCID mice  Consistent with the soft agar colony formation\n\nassays  PROCR+/ESA+ cells were highly tumorigenic since tumor\n\nformation could be observed from a starting population of as little\n\nas 100 PROCR+/ESA+ cells within 50 days  Table 2  Although\n\nPROCR2/ESA2 cells were also able to form tumors when more\n\ncells  2500 cells  were injected  the volume of the PROCR2/\n\nESA2 derived tumors was always much less than that of\n\nPROCR+/ESA+ derived tumors  These results suggest  first  that\n\nthe soft agar colony formation can serve as a surrogate assay for\n\ntumorigenicity in animals during this cancer stem cell selection\n\nprocedure and  second  that the cancer stem/progenitor cells of\n\nMDA-MB-231 were enriched by PROCR+/ESA+ selection \n\nAlso consistent with the soft agar colony formation assay\n\n Figure 1E  both PROCR+ and PROCR2 cells isolated from the\n\nMDA-MB-361 cell line were able to form tumors in the mammary\n\nfat pad of NOD/SCID mice from as little as 500 cells injected\n\n Table 3  However  the PROCR+ derived tumors were five to ten-\n\nfold larger than tumors derived from PROCR2 cells  The\n\nobservation that PROCR2 cells were able to cause tumor\n\nformation  albeit at a lower rate of tumor growth  suggests that\n\nthe PROCR marker alone may not be the optimal selection of the\n\nstem/progenitor cells from this cell line \n\nPROCR+/ESA+ Subpopulation Cells Divide Asymmetrically\nIn Vitro and In Vivo\nAsymmetric division is another stem cell characteristic in\n\naddition to the high tumorigenic ability  To test whether the\n\nselected subpopulation exhibits this property  the PROCR+/ESA+\n\nand PROCR2/ESA2 cells were sorted and cultured in an\n\nattachment culture system  Figure 2  After just two passages  the\n\nprevalence of PROCR+/ESA+ cells decreased from 93 5%\n\n Figure 2B  to 53 5%  Figure 2E  With an additional two passages \n\nthe prevalence of this population decreased to 27 1%  Figure 2H \n\nand the prevalence of other subpopulations increased  Thus  after\n\nonly two to four passages  the proportion of each subpopulation\n\nhad already returned to that of the bulk population before sorting \n\nTo further confirm whether the increased prevalence of the\n\nPROCR2/ESA2 subpopulation was indeed due to asymmetric\n\ndivision  cell cycle profiling analysis was performed  Figure 3 \n\nAfter synchronization  Figure 3A  the cells were released from\n\nserum starvation and a time-course cell cycle profiling analysis was\n\nperformed for the PROCR+/ESA+ and PROCR2/ESA2 cells \n\nThe PROCR+/ESA+ cells were able to reenter the cell cycle\n\nearlier and enter G2/M phase faster  Figure 3B  than the\n\nPROCR2/ESA2 cells  Figure 3D  Also  the PROCR+/ESA+\n\ncells expressed higher levels of NUMB which has been shown to\n\nregulate asymmetric division in several cell types [35–37]\n\n Figure 3C  These observations demonstrated that the increased\n\nprevalence of the PROCR2/ESA2 cells  Figure 2E  2H  did not\n\nresult from the proliferation of PROCR2/ESA2 cells  but rather\n\nwas due to the proliferation and asymmetric division of PROCR+/\n\nESA+ cells  In contrast  the sorted PROCR2/ESA2 cells were not\n\nable to divide asymmetrically  The prevalence of PROCR2/\n\nESA2 cells was 86%  Figure 2C  when sorted for in vitro culture \nAfter 2 and 4 passages  the prevalence remained at 75%  Figure 2F \n\nand 73%  Figure 2I  respectively  The minor changes in the\n\nprevalence of other subpopulations from passage 2 to passage 4\n\nwere negligible  Figure 2F  2I \n\nTo further address whether such asymmetric dividing ability\n\nalso occurred in vivo  tumors derived from PROCR+/ESA+ MDA-\nMB-231 cells were excised from the NOD/SCID mice and the\n\nPROCR and ESA expression profiles examined after separation of\n\nmouse lineages from the extracted tumor cells  The results\n\nindicated a decrease in the prevalence of the PROCR+/ESA+\n\ncells from 93 8%  before injection  Figure S3  to only 0 6%  Figure\n\nS3  Method S1  and an increase in other subpopulations \n\nInterestingly  this low percentage in vivo reflected the prevalence\nof PROCR+ cells in the human breast cancer specimens tested  see\n\nbelow \n\nPROCR+/ESA+ Subpopulation Cells Expressed EMT\nMarkers\nIt has been reported that stem cells from human mammary\n\nglands and mammary carcinomas express EMT markers including\n\nincreased vimentin  SLUG and FOXC2 gene expression and\n\ndecreased E-cadherin expression [19]  We then tested whether the\n\nPROCR+/ESA+ subpopulation of MDA-MB-231 cells

whether breast cancer cells freshly derived from\n\nclinical specimens express heterogeneous stem cell markers as\n\nobserved in human breast cancer cell lines  we performed stem cell\n\nmarker profiling by FACS analysis of nineteen specimens obtained\n\nfrom National Taiwan University Hospital  All specimens\n\nexamined contained CD44+/CD242/low cells  however  the\n\nprevalence of these cells ranged from 1 to 12 4 percent\n\n Figure 5A  and that of ALDH+ cells ranged from 1 4 to 19 8\n\npercent  Figure 5B  The percentage of cells that expressed\n\nCD133  CXCR4 and ESA varied even more among specimens \n\nOf the nineteen specimens  all specimens contained ESA+ cells\n\n Figure 5C  however  only eleven specimens contained a\n\ndetectable number of CD133+ cells  Figure 5D  and fifteen\n\ncontained CXCR4+ cells  Figure 5E  In specimens where\n\nexpression was detectable  the percentages of the cells that\n\nexpressed these markers ranged from 2 1 to 99 percent  0 1 to\n\n18 5 percent and 0 1 to 7 6 percent for ESA  CD133 and CXCR4 \n\nrespectively  PROCR and ABCG2 expressing cells were rare  only\n\n0 1 to 0 4 percent of the cells from ten specimens had

relationship of ALDH status and HER2 or ER  The widely\n\nvarying marker expression in the tumor specimens strongly\n\nsuggested the existence of more types of breast cancer stem cells\n\nthan have been previously described  Experiments where we\n\nperformed functional assays of tumorigenesis and in vivo tumor\n\nforming ability on marker expressing populations isolated from\n\nbreast cancer cell lines also strongly supported this hypothesis  In\n\nparticular  subpopulations of cells expressing markers PROCR\n\nand ESA were highly tumorigenic in both in vitro and in vivo assays \n\nThus PROCR and ESA expression defines as yet uncharacterized\n\ntypes of breast cancer stem cells and our data from both cell lines\n\nand primary specimens also suggest the existence of still more\n\ntypes of highly tumorigenic cells  These observations bring up two\n\ncentral questions  The first is whether the generally recognized\n\nmarkers that have been emphasized in previous studies of breast\n\ncancer stem cells actually identify the most highly tumorigenic\n\ncells  The second is whether there are different lineages of breast\n\ncancer stem cells which lead to different types of breast cancers\n\nand whether these different lineages may sometimes even coexist\n\nwithin the same tumor \n\nMost current studies have emphasized the identification of\n\ncancer stem cell subpopulations from breast tumors using CD44\n\nand CD24  It has been reported that CD44+/CD242/low cells\n\nwere more common in basal-like tumors and strongly associated\n\nwith BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer  however  not every basal\n\nbreast tumor contains CD44+/CD242/low cells [38]  Other recent\n\nstudies have also shown that the presence of CD44+/CD242/low\n\ncells in breast tumors did not correlate with clinical outcome\n\nincluding tumor size  lymph node status or S-phase fraction\n\n[22 39]  More recent data suggests that the newly identified\n\nmarker ALDH could be more effective in identifying the most\n\ntumorigenic breast cancer stem cells [21]  However  only 30% of\n\ntumors contained ALDH+ cells  Although the ALDH phenotype\n\ncorrelates with clinical outcome such as tumor grade  no\n\nassociation with a particular molecular subtype of breast cancer\n\nwas observed [21]  These findings raise the possibility that there\n\nmight be cancer stem cells other than CD44+/CD242/low or\n\nALDH+ that drive breast tumorigenesis  It has been reported that\n\nuse of the surface marker CD133 can isolate a group of breast\n\ncancer stem cells that does not overlap with CD44+/CD242 cells\n\n[23]  which is consistent with our data that CD44+/CD242 cells\n\nmay not have the highest tumorigenic ability  In HCC1937  cells\n\nthat lacked CD44+/CD242 marker expression were capable of\n\nforming more colonies on soft agar than the CD44+/CD242 cells\n\n Figure 1B  These findings further suggest that CD44+/CD242\n\ncan only enrich a subtype of breast cancer stem cell populations \n\nOn the other hand  we observed that cells with positive ALDH\n\nwere not consistently correlated with their tumorigenicity \n\nAlthough the ALDH+ ZR-75 cells exhibited higher tumorigenicity\n\nthan bulk cells  Figure 1A  the ALDH marker failed to enrich\n\nhigher tumorigenic cancer stem cells from the SKBR3  Figure 1C \n\nand HCC1937 cell lines  Figure S2  Method S1  These\n\nobservations further demonstrated that CD44+/CD242/low and\n\nALDH cannot serve as universal markers for cancer stem cell\n\nidentification and isolation  Apparently  additional marker-identi-\n\nfication study is needed to further define new cancer stem cell\n\npopulations \n\nDifferent human breast cancer cell lines are known to have\n\ndifferent abilities to form tumors in vivo  It is possible that this\n\ndifference in tumorigenicity is due to the presence of different\n\ntypes of cancer stem cells  Similar to primary tumor specimens \n\ndifferent breast cancer cell lines had different cancer stem cell\n\nmarker profiles as demonstrated in this study  Table 1  For each\n\ncell line  the subpopulations expressing cancer stem cell markers\n\nexhibited tumorigenic ability different from that of cells without\n\nmarker expression  Using PROCR and ESA markers  we were\n\nable to isolate a subset of highly tumorigenic cells from the MDA-\n\nMB-231 cell line  the prevalence of CD44+/CD242/low in the bulk\n\ncell population was more than 90%   Figure 1D and Table 2 \n\nAlthough it has been reported that CD44+ and PROCR+ cells\n\nwere similar to each other and were enriched for genes involved in\n\ncell motility  chemotaxis  hemostasis  and angiogenesis as well as\n\nstem cell-specific genes [22]  our data suggested that PROCR+/\n\nESA+ allowed further enrichment of highly tumorigenic cancer\n\nstem cells from the CD44+/CD242/low breast cancer cells  In\n\naddition  our preliminary proteome analysis suggests that\n\nPROCR+/ESA+ cells exhibit a cancer stem cell molecular\n\nsignature and that PROCR+/ESA+ and PROCR2/ESA2\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells differ in expression of a number of proteins\n\n WWHV et al unpublished data  For example  PROCR+/ESA+\n\ncells showed a higher expression of casein kinase 2 which is\n\ninvolved in the Wnt signaling pathway [40] known to be highly\n\nactivated in breast cancer stem cells  Such additional character-\n\nization of the tumorigenic cell populations has potential to clearly\n\ndefine the molecular signature of the small populations with highly\n\ntumorigenic activity \n\nIt was a significant challenge to conduct experiments using\n\nprimary tumor cells due to limited materials  To overcome this\n\ndifficulty  in vitro culture and in animal xenograft tumor\n\ntransplantations are required to expand cancer cells for assessing\n\nfunctional stem cell properties in primary tumors  albeit  the\n\nTable 4  Pathology data of the human breast cancer\nspecimens tested \n\nSpecimen

//breast-cancer-research com/supplements/11/S3/S19\n\nPage 1 of 3\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nIntroduction\nThe aim of breast screening is to reduce mortality and\nmorbidity from breast cancer  One of the areas of concern in\nrelation to breast screening is the marked increase in the\nnumber of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ  DCIS \ndetected through breast screening \n\nDCIS comprises less than 5% of all symptomatic breast\ncancers but now comprises more than 25% of all screen-\ndetected cancers [1]  Detecting DCIS should theoretically\nreduce the subsequent incidence of invasive cancer  and in\nterms of screening it should have the same effect as treating\ncervical intra-epithelial neoplasia of the cervix  DCIS has an\nexcellent long-term outlook and there are concerns that many\npatients with DCIS would not have developed an invasive\ncancer if left untreated \n\nThe issue in relation to DCIS therefore has to be avoiding\npotential overtreatment because few women die as a conse-\nquence of having DCIS  particularly if the carcinoma is low\ngrade  Retrospective studies have found that  after excision\n which often did not remove all of the DCIS  low-grade DCIS\nprogresses to invasive cancer in only one-third of all women\nby 20 years [2] \n\nNew data from the UK Breast Screening\nProgramme\nThe numbers of patients with DCIS has increased over the\npast decade  In 1998/99 there were approximately 1 500\ncases  but in 2007/08 there were close to 3 500 cases\n Figure 1  The percentage of patients being treated by\nbreast-conserving surgery during this period has remained\nfairly constant at 30%  Figure 2  The effect of this is that the\nabsolute numbers of women having mastectomies has\nincreased from just under 500 in 1998/99 to over 900 in\n2007/08  Figure 3  These data mean that the absolute\nnumbers of patients undergoing mastectomy has almost\ndoubled over the past decade  Although a recent statistical\nmodel estimated that women attending for screening have a\n\n166 times higher probability of having progressive DCIS or\ninvasive cancer than nonprogressive DCIS  there remains\nconcern that the natural history of DCIS has not been well\ndefined [3] \n\nFrom the Sloane Project  which collects data on all patients\nwith DCIS treated within most of the major UK centres  it is\nevident that some patients with DCIS are undergoing\nmastectomies for a radiological extent of DCIS <40 mm  Size\nis not a good predictor of the overall recurrence rate in DCIS\n[4]  therefore  if the DCIS can be removed adequately even if\nthere are large areas  then mastectomy is not absolutely\nrequired even when DCIS extends beyond 4 cm  The\neffectiveness of local excision is related to the fact that\nalmost all DCIS is unicentric [4] \n\nHow to address the increasing mastectomy\nrate for DCIS within the Screening\nProgramme  and what are the options \nMore than 50% of DCIS lesions are oestrogen receptor rich\n[5]  Preoperative aromatase inhibitors reduce proliferation in\nDCIS [6] and tamoxifen reduces recurrence in oestrogen\nreceptor-positive DCIS  so oestrogen receptor-positive DCIS\nis hormone responsive [7]  This knowledge raises the option\nof neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and there is some evidence\nthat this is effective \n\nFrom studies of invasive cancer  neoadjuvant endocrine\ntherapy reduces the overall tumour size of both the invasive\ncomponent and the in situ component  producing a central\nscar [8]  Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy of DCIS is being\nfurther investigated in a US study [9]  Early data are\npromising with results from the first six patients who have\ncompleted 3 months of treatment  The three oestrogen\nreceptor-positive DCIS patients all showed a clinical\nresponse with a decrease in tissue density rather than a\nreduction in extent [9]  It is clear  however  that the optimal\nresponse time to neoadjuvant hormone treatment is longer\nthan 3 months  and 9-month or 10-month treatment durations\n\nShort communication\nBreast screening has increased the number of mastectomies\nJ Michael Dixon\n\nBreakthrough Research Unit

in tumour size [10] \n\nApproximately 40% of DCIS overexpress HER2 [7]  Neo-\nadjuvant trastuzumab for invasive cancer increases the patho-\nlogical complete response rate from 20% with chemotherapy\nalone to 40 to 50% with the same chemotherapy and trastu-\nzumab [11]  There is evidence in the laboratory that anti-\nHER2 therapy is effective in DCIS  and ongoing trials are\nevaluating whether lapatanib reduces proliferation in HER2-\npositive DCIS [4]  Neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy for DCIS\n\ntherefore requires exploring  has potential and may save\nsome breasts \n\nAnother option for large areas of DCIS is oncoplastic surgery \nwhich excises the DCIS but leaves the breast shape intact\nand produces minimal scars  The success of breast-con-\nserving surgery for the treatment of breast cancer is that this\nsurgery can remove completely the local disease while\npreserving the natural shape and appearance of the breast\n[12]  Achieving the twin goals of complete tumour excision\nand a satisfactory cosmetic outcome can be challenging  The\nlimiting factors are the amount of tissue that can be removed\nrelative to the breast size and tumour location \n\nFor larger areas of DCIS that require significant volume\nexcision and reshaping of the affected breast  this is being\ncombined with a simultaneous or delayed reduction mammo-\nplasty of the opposite breast  Two surgeons  an oncoplastic\nsurgeon and a plastic surgeon  provide the optimal approach\nfor simultaneous bilateral mammoplasty procedures  reducing\nthe operating time and combining the skills of both\ndisciplines  Using oncoplastic surgery in larger breasts it is\npossible to excise areas of DCIS up to 10 cm  Excising more\ntissue during reduction in mammoplasty approaches results\nin a greater incidence of clear margins  and to date the\ncomplications have been limited and the cosmetic results\nexcellent  Figure 3  This option is not widely available but it\nshould be the aim to offer this option for all women with larger\nbreasts  even with extensive unifocal DCIS  who wish to be\ntreated by breast-conserving surgery  Such women need to\nbe fully informed of the potential advantages  risks and\ncomplications of this procedure  including incomplete\nexcision of all disease if the disease is more extensive than\n\nFigure 1\n\nPatients diagnosed

//breast-cancer-research com/supplements/11/S3/S18\n\nPage 1 of 3\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nThe BIG1-98 trial\nThe BIG1-98 trial  involving over 8 000 postmenopausal\nwomen with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer \nwas a four-arm trial of adjuvant endocrine therapy for early\nbreast cancer comparing 5 years of tamoxifen treatment\nversus 5 years of letrozole treatment versus 2 years of\ntamoxifen then switch to letrozole treatment versus 2 years of\nletrozole then switch to tamoxifen treatment  The initial results\nof the trial  which compared only the upfront tamoxifen and\nletrozole arms  showed a small but highly statistically\nsignificant disease-free survival  DFS  advantage in favour of\nletrozole with a hazard ratio of 0 81 and an absolute 4-year\nimprovement in DFS of 2 7% [1] \n\nThese results were entirely compatible with the other major\nupfront adjuvant aromatase inhibitor trial  the ‘Arimidex’ \nTamoxifen  Alone or in Combination  ATAC  trial  This was a\nthree-arm trial in which tamoxifen treatment for 5 years was\ncompared with anastrozole treatment for 5 years and com-\npared with the combination of the two treatments  This trial\nlikewise showed a DFS advantage in favour of anastrozole \nwith a hazard ratio of 0 83 and a 4-year absolute disease-free\nsurvival difference of 2 4% [2] \n\nNeither the BIG1-98 trial or the ATAC trial showed any\nsignificant overall survival benefit at first analysis \n\nIn the BIG1-98 trial update  4 922 patients were included in\nthe tamoxifen versus letrozole monotherapy comparison [3] \nWith a median follow-up of 76 months  letrozole treatment\ncontinued to show a statistically significant DFS advantage\nover tamoxifen therapy  with a hazard ratio of 0 88  In the\nintent-to treat overall survival analysis there was a very strong\ntrend in favour of letrozole over tamoxifen that did not quite\nreach statistical significance  with a hazard ratio of 0 7  95%\nconfidence interval  0 75 to 1 02  These results were\n\nconfounded  however  by 25% of patients initially randomised\nto tamoxifen treatment electing to crossover to letrozole\ntreatment in 2005 when the initial results were announced \nMost of these patients crossed over in years 3 to 5 with a\nmedian duration of letrozole treatment after crossover of\n18 months  This led to a bias against letrozole because other\ndata  see below  have shown that a switch from tamoxifen to\nan aromatase inhibitor after around 2 years is associated with\nan improved DFS \n\nIn a censored analysis to allow for this bias  the overall\nsurvival ratio was significantly in favour of letrozole with a\nhazard ratio of 0 81  25% confidence interval  0 69 to 0 94 \nThe true figure for overall survival difference probably lies\nbetween these two analyses and would almost certainly show\na significant survival benefit for letrozole \n\nNo suggestion of a similar survival advantage has been seen\nin the ATAC trial  with the most recent hazard ratio for\ntamoxifen treatment versus anastrozole treatment being 0 97 \nThe Femara versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation trial\ndirectly compares letrozole with anastrozole in over 4 000\nwomen with node-positive breast cancer  and will provide\ndata on whether letrozole does indeed achieve superior\nclinical efficacy to anastrozole \n\nPrior to the BIG1-98 update  several trials  including IES \nARNO  ABCSG and ITA  suggested that sequential adjuvant\naromatase inhibitors given after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen\ntreatment had a significant DFS advantage over tamoxifen\nalone  with hazard ratios ranging from 0 42 to 0 76  These\nhazard ratios appeared superior to those achieved with the\nupfront aromatase inhibitor approach compared with tamoxifen \nand led to speculation that sequential therapy starting with\ntamoxifen and then switching after around 2 years might be\nsuperior to starting with an aromatase inhibitor up front \n\nShort

11 Suppl 3 Smith\n\nPage 2 of 3\n page number not for citation purposes \n\nThe BIG1-98 trial update also addressed this issue  The trial\nincluded for the first time randomised data on the sequential\ntherapy approach  Three blinded arms were compared \nletrozole treatment for 5 years versus 2 years of tamoxifen and\nthen switch to letrozole treatment versus 2 years of letrozole\nand then switch to tamoxifen treatment  This evaluation had a\nmedian follow-up of 71 months  Overall there was no\nsignificant difference between any of the three treatments in\nterms of 5-year DFS  87 9%  87 6% and 86 2%  respectively \nUpfront letrozole treatment for 5 years  however  showed a\nstrong trend towards superiority over starting with tamoxifen\nfor 2 years and then switching to 3 years of letrozole\ntreatment  This was particularly seen in patients with node-\npositive disease  No such trend was seen in the letrozole for\n5 years versus letrozole then tamoxifen comparison \n\nIn conclusion  the BIG1-98 trial update has for the first time\nshown a very strong trend towards an overall survival\nadvantage in favour of upfront letrozole versus tamoxifen\ntreatment  which would probably have reached significance\nwithout the confounding effect of crossover in the tamoxifen\narm  The update has also shown no advantage of starting with\ntamoxifen for 2 years and then switching  indeed  the trend is\nin the other direction  The evidence from the BIG 1-98 update\ntherefore argues strongly in favour of postmenopausal women\nwith early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer being\ntreated initially with letrozole 2 5 mg orally daily for 5 years in\nthe first instance  It is important to note  however  that\ntamoxifen still remains a very effective alternative where toxicity\nor cost issues cause problems with letrozole treatment \n\nThe ZO-FAST trial\nIn the ZO-FAST trial 1 060 postmenopausal women with\nhormone receptor-positive breast cancer being treated with\nadjuvant letrozole 2 5 mg orally daily were randomised to\nadditional zoledronate 4 mg intravenously 6-monthly for\n5 years versus zoledronate added only in the face of the bone\nmineral density T score falling below –2 or the development\nof clinical or asymptomatic fracture at 36 months  so-called\ndelayed treatment  The primary endpoint was the percentage\nchange in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months \nbut important secondary objectives included the incidence of\nfractures at 3 years  the time to disease recurrence/relapse \noverall survival and safety \n\nThe ZO-FAST trial achieved its primary endpoint demon-\nstrating a lumbar bone mineral density improvement of 4 39%\nat 12 months in patients on immediate zoledronate compared\nwith a mean bone mineral density loss of –4 9% in those on\ndelayed zoledronate  P <0 0001  Similar changes were seen\nfor the hip  This overall difference in bone mineral density\nemerged within 12 months of starting therapy and continued\nto increase during year 2 and again during year 3 \n\nIntriguingly  patients on immediate zoledronate treatment also\nhad a significantly decreased risk of DFS compared with\n\nthose on elective delayed therapy  with a hazard ratio of 0 59\n P = 0 03  This included a lower incidence of local recur-\nrence  0 4% for immediate zoledronate versus 1 9% recurrence\nfor delayed zoledronate  suggesting the effect was not\nsimply mediated through inhibition of bone metastases\n where the difference was 1 7% vs  3 2%  respectively  So\nfar 2 1% of patients have died following immediate\nzoledronate treatment  versus 3 4% in the delayed arm  There\nwas no significant increased risk of adverse events with the\nimmediate treatment approach  No cases of renal impairment\nrelated to the study drug were seen  Osteonecrosis of the\njaw was seen in one patient  0 2%  on immediate zoledronate\ntreatment versus none with the delayed approach \n\nFurther evidence for an overall improvement in DFS with\nimmediate 6-monthly zoledronate comes from the ABCCSG-12\ntrial [4]  In this trial 1 803 premenopausal women were\nrandomised to tamoxifen and goserelin treatment versus\nanastrozole and goserelin treatment  In a secondary randomi-\nsation  all patients were also randomised to zoledronate\ntreatment versus no additional bisphosphonate therapy \n\nWith 48 months median follow-up  the addition of 6-month\nzoledronate therapy prevented bone mineral density loss \nwhich was seen in both endocrine therapy arms without\nzoledronate \n\nIn addition there was again an improvement in DFS for\npatients randomised to receive immediate 6-monthly zoledro-\nnate with a hazard ratio of 0 64  P = 0 019  compared with\nthe delayed approach  As in the ZO-FAST trial  there was a\nreduction in local regional relapse  10 patients vs  20\npatients  as well as in distant relapse including bone meta-\nstases  23 patients vs  16 patients  Sixteen patients have so\nfar died in those treated with zoledronate  versus 26 patients\nin those without this treatment \n\nZoledronate has several potential mechanisms of action to\nexplain this observation  including the induction of apoptosis \nthe inhibition of tumour cell growth in vitro  inhibition of\nadhesion and invasion  and possible anti-angiogenic effects \n\nCurrent National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines\nand St Gallen recommendations suggest that bisphospho-\nnates should not be used routinely as adjuvant therapy  but\nshould be guided by bone mineral density \n\nAlthough the ZO-FAST trial results are from early phases  the\nfact that they are reinforced by very similar results from the\nABCCG-12 trial argues that current guidelines should be\nchanged and that zoledronate treatment by 6-monthly\nintravenous infusion should be included as standard therapy\nfor women with hormone receptor-positive early breast\ncancer  This inclusion of intravenous zoledronate is not just to\nprevent bone mineral density loss but also on the basis of a\nsignificant DFS advantage \n\n\n\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that they have no competing interests

human papillomavirus\n HPV  and cervical cancer  two new approaches for the prevention of cervical cancer have\nemerged  1  HPV vaccination for primary HPV prevention in younger women and 2 \ncarcinogenic HPV detection for secondary prevention via identifying and treating cervical\nprecancer and early cancers  Both have demonstrated high degrees of efficacy with\nmaximum effectiveness guided by an understanding of the causal model and application of\nthese technologies in an age-appropriate manner  1  Despite the advent of these promising\nprevention tools  there is a real need to develop non-surgical methods for treating cervical\nprecancerous lesions and even early cancer for three reasons  First  current HPV vaccines\nare prophylactic and do not treat pre-existing HPV infections  1  Second  surgical excision\nof screen-detected precancerous lesions  while a highly efficacious  90–95%  treatment  1 \nincreases the risk of preterm delivery and infant morbidity and mortality  2  Third  most\nwomen who screen positive by a Pap and/or HPV do not have clinically-actionable disease \nyet these women are at risk of cervical precancer and cancer in the future and must be\nfollowed-up intensively  Finally  in the low-resource settings  surgical methods are not\ncommonly available and cryotherapy  while moderately efficacious when its use is limited to\nsmaller lesions  causes significant watery discharge and requires sexual abstinence for\nseveral weeks to permit healing of treated epithelium \n\nDespite the knowledge that HPV infection is the obligate cause of cervical cancer  targeted\nimmunological approaches for therapy such as therapeutic vaccines have been unsuccessful\n 3  Chung and Lambert  4  present a novel approach of using estrogen

epidemiological\ndata  6 7  that estrogen plays contributing role in cervical carcinogenesis  In this study \nChung and Lambert  4  successfully treated 7 E6/E7 transgenic mice that

in breast cancer  The 78-kD\nglucose-regulated protein  GRP78  is a potent anti-apoptotic factor  conferring drug resistance \nRecently  we reported that high GRP78 expression in breast cancer specimens predict a shorter\nrecurrence-free survival in patients who received doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy \nInterestingly  the opposite effect was observed in 25 patients who additionally received a taxane \nTo confirm this potentially paradigm shifting finding  we investigated whether GRP78 is\nassociated with recurrence-free survival in an independent cohort of taxane-treated breast cancer\npatients  Immunohistochemical staining of GRP78 was performed on archival paraffin-embedded\nformalin-fixed tumor specimens obtained from 48 female breast cancer patients before\nchemotherapy treatment  These patients received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide  followed by\npaclitaxel or docetaxel on a clinical trial  GRP78 expression level was evaluated by a pathologist \nmasked to all clinical and outcome data  Association between GRP78 expression and recurrence-\nfree survival was evaluated  GRP78 positivity predicts a better recurrence-free survival \nindependent of other prognostic factors [hazard ratio  HR  for moderate positivity  0 40  95%\nconfidence interval  CI  0 087–1 83  HR for strong positivity  0 16  95% CI  0 018–1 50 \nPtrend=0 053]  In a pooled analysis with the previous 25 patients  almost identical HRs were\nobtained with Ptrend=0 024  This provides further evidence that GRP78 is a potential independent\npredictor for response to taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer \n\nIntroduction\nApproximately 182 000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the US 1 Over\n90% are found at an early stage without distant

improved patient survival 4  5 Currently  prognostic factors\nincluding patient age  tumor stage  and estrogen receptor status are used to decide the need\nof adjuvant chemotherapy 6 However  there are few predictive markers of benefit from\ntaxane-containing adjuvant chemotherapy  One candidate marker is HER2 in which\npositivity was shown to predict benefit from addition of paclitaxel to doxorubicin treatment7\nalthough these results may not be applicable given the current targeted treatment for HER2-\npositive breast cancer  ie  trastuzumab \n\nThe 78-kD glucose-regulated protein  GRP78  also known as BiP  is a multi-functional\nCa2+ binding protein primarily residing in the endoplasmic reticulum controlling\nendoplasmic reticulum homeostasis  stress signaling and protein quality control 8 In vitro\nstudies established that GRP78 possesses potent anti-apoptotic properties and confers drug\nresistance to tumor cells as well as tumor associated endothelial cells 9–12 GRP78\nsuppresses doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis in part through inhibition of BAX and caspase-7\nactivation 13  14 A retrospective analysis of 127 breast cancer patients who received adjuvant\ndoxorubicin-based chemotherapy directly links GRP78 positivity to a shorter recurrence-free\nsurvival independent of other prognostic factors 15 Interestingly  an unplanned subset\nanalysis revealed that this association was reversed among patients who also received\nadjuvant taxane  n=25  such that GRP78 positivity appeared to be associated with a better\noutcome  HR=0 15  P=0 072  p for interaction=0 012  As taxanes are now widely\nprescribed as adjuvant chemotherapy 16 investigation of the predictive value of GRP78 in\nsequential doxorubicin and taxane regimens is of great importance \n\nHere we report the results of a follow-up retrospective study  designed to examine the\npredictive value of one specific marker  GRP78  in response to adjuvant doxorubicin\nfollowed by taxanes \n\nMaterial and methods\nParticipants\n\nThis study includes female patients with breast cancer who had archived prior to treatment\nformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimen in LAC+USC Medical Center and who\nreceived doxorubicin  cyclophosphamide  followed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel between\n2000 and 2002 on a clinical trial  Among the 60 patients enrolled in the trial  48 had invasive\ntumor samples that were suitable for GRP78 analysis  46 specimens were primary breast\ntumor specimens  2 specimens were from lymph node metastasis  their primary tumors were\nnot

stages of the cell cycle and have been implicated in cancer progression  Unlike its other\nfamily members the expression of Plk3 remains steady during cell cycle progression  suggesting\nthat its activity may be spatiotemporally regulated  However  the mechanism of regulation of Plk3\nactivity is not well understood  Here  we show that calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1\n CIB1  a Plk3 interacting protein  is widely expressed in various cancer cell lines  Expression of\nCIB1 mRNA as well as protein is increased in breast cancer tissue as compared to normal tissue \nCIB1 constitutively interacts with Plk3 as determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays  This\ninteraction of CIB1 with Plk3 is independent of intracellular Ca2+  Furthermore  binding of CIB1\nresults in inhibition of Plk3 kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo  Interestingly  this inhibition of\nthe Plk3 activity by CIB1 is Ca2+-dependent  Taken together  our results suggest that CIB1 is a\nregulatory subunit of Plk3 and it regulates Plk3 activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner  Furthermore \nupregulation of CIB1 in cancer cells could thus inhibit Plk3 activity leading to abnormal cell cycle\nregulation in breast cancer cells  Thus in addition to Plk3  CIB1 may be a potential biomarker and\ntarget for therapeutic intervention of breast cancer \n\nKeywords\nCIB1  calcium- and

Plk family consists of four members that have been identified in the mammalian cells \nPlk1  Plk2/Snk  Plk3/Fnk/Prk  proliferation-related kinase  and Plk4/Sak 4–8  These kinases\nare characterized by the presence of highly conserved noncatalytic domains termed polo\nboxes 9  These polo boxes are shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions and are\nrequired for subcellular localization of Plks 10  They bind to the phosphorylated serine or\nthreonine residues of the binding partners and regulate subcellular localization of Plks 10–12 \nIn addition  the C-terminus  which contains the polo boxes  is shown to be involved in\nregulation of kinase activity 13 \n\nControlled expression or activity of the Plks has been shown to regulate normal progression\nof cell cycle  Since variations in their activity or expression often leads to oncogenic\ntransformation  these protein kinases are considered to be proto-oncogenes 14  The\ndifference in their function and regulation depends on their spatiotemporal expression \nsubcellular localization  and substrate specificity 15–17  Expression of Plk1 is strongly\ncorrelated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many cancers 18–20  Reduction in Plk2\nexpression has been reported to enhance stress-induced apoptosis 21  whereas  Plk3\nexpression is shown to increase during G1 phase  but remains mostly unaltered during cell\ncycle progression 22–24  In contrast to Plk1  Plk3 expression has been negatively correlated\nwith the development of certain cancers 3  It is thus believed that regulation of Plk3 activity\nor subcellular localization may dictate its function during the cell cycle  but little is known\nabout the mechanism by which this regulation occurs \n\nUsing the yeast two-hybrid system  Plk3 was shown to interact with CIB1 16  which was\noriginally identified as a calcium- and integrin αIIb-binding protein with a sequence\nsimilarity to the regulatory molecules calcineurin B and calmodulin 25  CIB1 mRNA and\nprotein expression is widespread  including notable expression in some cancer cell lines 26 \nWe investigated the physiological relevance of interaction between Plk3 and CIB1  Here we\nshow that CIB1 is expressed in several cancer cell lines and its expression is upregulated\nduring breast cancer progression  We also show that CIB1 constitutively binds Plk3 and\ninhibits its kinase activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner  Taken together  our results suggest\nthat CIB1 acts as a regulatory subunit of Plk3  and thereby contributes to the regulation of\nthe cell cycle in a Ca2+-dependent manner \n\n2  Materials and methods\n2 1  Cell culture and transfection\n\nHuman breast carcinoma cell lines T47D  MDA-MB-468  MDA-MB-361  MDA-MB-436 \nMCF-7  and

identified as an integrin αIIb-binding protein 25  it was\nsubsequently shown that CIB1 expression is not limited to platelet-specific lineages  In fact \nCIB1 mRNA appears to be widely expressed 26  In order to determine whether CIB1 protein\nis expressed in breast cancer-derived cell lines  we performed Western blot analysis using\nCIB1-specific antibody  HUVEC were used as positive control where it was found to\nexpress  We found that CIB1 protein is expressed in all breast cancer cell lines tested \nEspecially  in T47D  MCF-7  MCF-10A  and MDA-MB-361 cell lines  the level of CIB1\nexpression is substantially more than that of HUVECs  Fig  1A  Equal loading of protein in\neach lane was ascertained through HSC-70 probing  We next determined the extent of CIB1\nupregulation in breast cancer tissue by probing a cDNA array in which cDNA synthesized\nfrom 9 human breast tumors and the adjacent normal tissue from each individual was used \n\nNaik et al  Page 4\n\nInt J

cDNA to its matched normal sample using expression\nof three separate housekeeping genes  We found a detectable level of CIB1 message in the\nnormal tissue  However  all breast tumor tissues showed an increased level of CIB1 mRNA\nexpression compared to their corresponding normal tissue  Fig  1B  Quantitation of the\nexpression of CIB1 mRNA level in the tumor tissue showed an average of two-fold increase\nover the normal levels  Fig  1C  These results suggest that CIB1 mRNA expression is\nupregulated in breast cancer tissue \n\n3 2  CIB1 protein expression is upregulated in breast tumor\nIncreased expression of the CIB1 message in breast cancer tissue and a variety of breast\ncarcinoma cell lines  prompted us to determine CIB1 protein expression in normal and\ntumorigenic breast tissue  Commercially available tumor and normal breast tissue sections\nwere immunohistochemically stained using anti-CIB1 antibody  H&E staining of the normal\nbreast tissue section showed typical glandular morphology and mammary epithelial cell\nlining  Fig  2Ai  In normal breast epithelium tissue  CIB1 localized along the cell\nmembrane of glandular epithelial cells as was expected for a myristoylated protein  Fig \n2Aii  Interestingly  in tumor tissue  CIB1 expression appears to be upregulated  and\nlocalized throughout the cell  not just restricted to the membrane of the glandular epithelial\ncells  Fig  2Aiii  This is not surprising since CIB1 is known to function as a myristoyl\nswitch 30  No staining was observed when isotype-specific control antibody was used \nsuggesting that the anti-CIB1 staining is highly specific  Fig  2Aiv  Comparison of pixel\nintensities of the images captured at identical laser power indicated a significant increase in\nCIB1 expression in tumors compared to normal breast tissue  Fig  2Av \n\nIn order to assess the expression of CIB1 during breast cancer progression  a tissue array\ncontaining samples of various pathological grades assigned by the manufacturer were\nimmunohistochemically stained with anti-CIB1  An isotype specific control IgG had no\nstaining as expected  Fig  2Bi  Adjacent tissue 1 5 cm away from the tumor showed low\nstaining for CIB1  Fig  2Bii  Interestingly  tumor tissue of increasing grade showed\nincreased level of expression of CIB1  Fig  2Biii–v  Quantification of mean fluorescence\nintensity as a measure of CIB1 expression indicated a significant increase in CIB1\nexpression in various grades of breast tumors compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissue\n Fig  2Bvi  To verify the increase in CIB1 expression is indeed in proliferating tumor cells\nthe sections were double stained for CIB1 and Ki67  a proliferation specific marker  We\nfound that CIB1 and Ki67 colocalized confirming the increased expression of CIB1 in tumor\ncells  Fig  2C  Taken together  these results suggest that CIB1 expression is increased\nduring breast cancer progression \n\n3 3  Plk3 interacts with CIB1 in vivo and in vitro\nIt has been shown previously through the yeast two-hybrid assay that CIB1 and Plk3 interact\n16  Due to the established role of Plk3 in cell cycle progression  and the known expression of\nPlk3 and CIB1 in a number of cancer cell lines  including T47D  it was apparent that the\ninteraction between Plk3 and CIB1 might play a role in cancer progression  To determine\ntheir in vivo interaction in a breast cancer cell line  we performed a coimmunoprecipitation\nassay from T47D cell-lysates using well-characterized  highly-specific antibodies  Plk3 was\ncoimmunoprecipitated with CIB1 by anti-CIB1  but not by an isotype-specific control IgG\n cIgG   Fig  3A  This was further confirmed in a reciprocal immunoprecipitation\nexperiment where CIB1 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Plk3  suggesting that a specific\ninteraction occurs between CIB1 and Plk3 in vivo  Fig  3A  Although  the antibodies used\nwere shown to be specific to CIB1 25  27 and Plk3 23  we further confirmed the specificity of\n\nNaik et al  Page 5\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 February 1

down-\nregulating Plk3 in T47D cells using Plk3 specific shRNA  respectively  We found that in\nCHO cells anti-CIB1 does not recognize any band  but in CIB1 overexpressing cells\nrecognizes a 22kDa band corresponding to human CIB1  Fig  3B  In T47D cells  anti-Plk3\nshows down-regulation of Plk3 by Plk3-specific shRNA  Fig  3C \n\nCoimmunoprecipitation of endogenous CIB1 with Plk3 and vice versa does not determine\nwhether they interact directly or indirectly through other proteins being part of a multi-\nprotein complex  To address this  we generated and purified recombinant Plk3 and CIB1\nproteins  and performed an in vitro solid-phase binding assay  We found that Plk3 bound to\nimmobilized CIB1 in a concentration dependent and saturable manner  demonstrating a\nphysical interaction between the two proteins  Fig  3D  The approximate KD of 2 6 ± 0 5\nnM calculated from the above binding data indicate that these proteins bind with a very high\naffinity  This is consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data reported previously 16  These\nfindings further suggest that the interaction of CIB1 with Plk3 does not require any post-\ntranslational modifications such as phosphorylation since the recombinant CIB1 protein\nused was produced in bacteria \n\n3 4  Plk3 interacts with CIB1 both in the absence and the presence of Ca2+\n\nBecause CIB1 is known to bind Ca2+ 25  we asked if its interaction with Plk3 is regulated by\nCa2+ in vivo  To test this  we repeated the coimmunoprecipitation experiment using lysates\nof cells pre-treated with or without BAPTA-AM to chelate endogenous Ca2+  Plk3 readily\ncoimmunoprecipitated with CIB1 in the absence of BAPTA-AM treatment  Fig  4A  The\npresence of BAPTA-AM greatly affected the amount of CIB1 immunoprecipitated  possibly\ndue to reduced affinity of the antibody for apo-CIB1  Fig  4A  The expression of Plk3 was\nnot affected by Ca2+ chelation  Fig  4A input  It appeared at first that reduced amount of\nPlk3 in the CIB1 immunoprecipitate of BAPTA-treated cell lysate was due to the reduced\ninteraction with CIB1  However  when normalized to the total immunoprecipitated CIB1  a\nsignificantly greater amount of Plk3 was coimmunoprecipitated  indicating that an increased\namount of Plk3 bound to CIB1  Fig  4B  This suggested a possibility that CIB1 may\ninteract with Plk3 both in the presence and the absence of Ca2+ \n\nTo further determine whether the binding affinity between CIB1 and Plk3 is altered in the\npresence of Ca2+  we performed an in vitro binding assay in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA \nWe used purified recombinant Plk3 and CIB1 proteins in this assay  To our surprise  we\nfound that CIB1 bound Plk3 in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+ with slightly\nbetter binding in the latter condition  Fig  4C  These results suggest that CIB1 is\nconstitutively bound to Plk3 and thus may function as a regulatory subunit of Plk3 \n\n3 5  Recombinant Plk3 activity was inhibited by purified recombinant CIB1 in a Ca2+-\ndependent manner\n\nWe determined the effect of CIB1 interaction on Plk3 kinase activity in an in vitro kinase\nassay  We first ascertained that the recombinant Plk3 is pure and active  We also excluded\nthe possibility that some other kinases were present as a contaminant and contributing to the\nobserved activity by showing that recombinant kinase-dead Plk3 prepared similarly does not\nshow any activity in this assay 31  Interestingly  recombinant Plk3 activity was inhibited\nupon addition of purified recombinant CIB1  Fig  5A  Densitometric quantitation of the\nband intensity from at least three separate experiments indicated a five-fold decrease in\nkinase activity that was statistically significant  Fig  5B  This inhibition of Plk3 activity was\nfound to be dependent on the concentration of CIB1 added  data not shown \n\nNaik et al  Page 6\n\nInt J Cancer  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 February 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nBecause CIB1 binds Plk3 in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+  we next investigated\nthe role of Ca2+ in this inhibition  We found that Ca2+-bound CIB1 inhibited Plk3 activity \nwhereas apo-CIB1  obtained by extensive dialysis of recombinant CIB1 in the presence of\nEGTA  had no effect  Fig  5C  The inability of apo-CIB1 to block kinase activity is not due\nto misfolding caused by the removal of Ca2+  since the circular dichroism spectrum of apo-\nand Ca2+-bound CIB1 were identical  data not shown  This was further confirmed by that\nfact that addition of Ca2+ to apo-CIB1 reestablished its ability to inhibit Plk3 activity  Fig \n5C  indicating that CIB1 regulates Plk3 activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner \n\n3 6  Ectopic overexpression of CIB1 in T47D cells attenuates Plk3 activity\nTo delineate if CIB1 inhibits Plk3 activity in vivo  we first investigated the endogenous level\nof CIB1 expression in T47D cells  Western blot analysis showed that a detectable amount of\nCIB1 expression is endogenous to this cell line  Fig  6A  as had been reported previously\n26  In order to overexpress CIB1  we transfected these cells with a CIB1-pcDNA construct \nThe cells transfected with CIB1 showed a several-fold higher level of CIB1 expression  as\ncompared to mock cells transfected with an empty vector as a control  Fig  6A and B  To\ndetermine that CIB1 inhibited Plk3 activity in vivo  we immunoprecipitated Plk3 from\nmock- and CIB1-transfected T47D cell lysates and performed an immunoprecipitate kinase\nassay  In agreement with our in vitro data  under similar amounts of immunoprecipitation \nPlk3 from mock-transfected cells had greater activity than Plk3 from CIB1-transfected cells\n Fig  6C  Quantification of data from several experiments suggested a significant decrease\nin Plk3 activity in the immunoprecipitates of CIB1-overexpressing cell lysates  Fig  6D \nTaken together  these results suggest that CIB1 is a regulatory subunit of Plk3 and it\nregulates Plk3 activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner \n\nDiscussion\nIn the present study  we sought to determine the physiological relevance of the interaction\nbetween Plk3 and CIB1 in breast cancer progression  We found that CIB1 mRNA as well as\nprotein is upregulated in various cancer cell lines  and in particular breast cancer tissues \nCIB1 expression appears to be increased during breast cancer progression  Our results\nfurther demonstrate that CIB1 constitutively binds to Plk3 and inhibits Plk3 activity in a\nCa2+-dependent manner  Taken together  these results provide evidence that CIB1 is a\nregulatory subunit of Plk3 and may be involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of this\nimportant tumor suppressor \n\nCIB1 has been shown to interact with Plk2 and Plk3  two of the members of polo-like kinase\nfamily 16  Here we show that CIB1 interacts with Plk3 in the presence and the absence of\nCa2+  but inhibits Plk3 activity only in the presence of Ca2+  Consistent with our results  it\nhas recently been shown that CIB1 also inhibits Plk2 activity in Cos-7 cells 17  It is possible\nthat CIB1  a calcium-binding protein  is activated upon a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and\ninhibits these kinases  Polo-like kinase family members are characterized by the presence of\na highly conserved polo box  a motif involved in protein-protein interactions  which has\nbeen shown to be important for the physiological function of these kinases 32  It has been\nshown that in addition to its kinase activity  the C-terminus of Plk3 is also important for its\nfunction  because overexpression of Plk3 or its kinase-dead mutant induces chromatin\ncondensation and apoptosis 33  This phenomenon seems to be dependent on Plk3′s C-\nterminal half  where the strictly-conserved polo box domains are situated  because\noverexpression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of Plk3 failed to induce cell death 33 \nRecently  it has been shown that the polo box functions as a specific phosphoserine or\nphosphothreonine binding domain and is involved in the localization of the kinase to the\ncentrosome 32  It is also known that the polo box is important for the subcellular localization\nof polo-like kinase family members 10  and it is interesting to note that CIB1 has been\n\nNaik et

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nshown to bind to the polo box of Plk3 possibly in a phosphorylation independent manner 16 \nIt is therefore possible that binding of CIB1 to Plk3 not only inhibits its activity  but may\nalso regulate its subcellular localization \n\nPlk3 expression is consistently downregulated in several carcinomas 7  34  It is thus\nhypothesized that Plk3 plays the role of a safeguard gene in controlling normal cell division \nand that its downregulation in carcinomas leads to compromised cell division  Plk3 has also\nbeen shown to phosphorylate the tumor suppressor protein  p53 on serine-20 resulting in its\nactivation 35  Thus inhibition or downregulation of Plk3 may lead to tumor progression \nConsistent with this notion it has been recently shown that genetic ablation of Plk3 results in\nspontaneous development of tumors in mice underscoring its function as a tumor suppressor\n36 \n\nExpression of Plk3 is rapidly induced upon exposure of serum-starved cells to growth\nfactors  implicating Plk3 in the regulation of cell proliferation 7  Unlike other members of\nthe polo-like kinase family  Plk3 expression levels remain rather constant during the normal\ncell cycle 37 except that it is slightly upregulated during the G1 phase 24  However  in head \nneck  and lung carcinomas  it has been shown that Plk3 levels are significantly\ndownregulated  contrasting that of another family member  Plk1 7  34  38  It is thus possible\nthat Plk3 activity is required for normal cell division in such precursor cells  and that its\ndownregulation may aid to cancer development  How Plk3 activity is regulated during the\ncell cycle in normal cells where Plk3 is substantially expressed is still not clear  However \nour finding that CIB1 inhibits Plk3 kinase activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner may provide\nsuch an explanation  Further experimentation will be necessary to address this possibility \n\nTaken together  our results suggest that CIB1 is a regulatory subunit of Plk3  and it affects\nthe activity of Plk3 in a Ca2+-dependent manner  Thus  during the normal cell cycle  Plk3\nactivity may be regulated by the level of CIB1 and an unwanted change in the expression of\neither may be a key determinant in the transformation from the normal to the malignant\nphenotype  making Plk3 and CIB1 potential targets for therapeutic intervention

of human death in the U S  The clinical management of\ncancer invariably involves diverse conventional modalities  including surgery  radiation  and\nchemotherapy[1]  Novel therapeutic agents and ethanopharmacological screenings provide\nscientists with an alternative avenue to discover active components and compounds to treat\ncancer with traditional medicines like botanicals  In recent years  botanicals have become an\nimportant source of biologically active natural products \n\nBotanicals contain effective anticancer compounds that could potentially be used alone or as\nadjuncts to existing chemotherapy to improve efficacy and reduce drug-induced adverse\nevents  A series of analyses has demonstrated the continuing and valuable contributions of\nbotanicals as sources not only of potential chemotherapeutic agents  but also of lead\ncompounds for the semi-synthesis or total synthesis of new drugs  In current cancer\ntreatments  approximately 80% of novel drugs originated from natural products [5] \n\nCorrespondence to Dr Chun-Su Yuan  MD  PhD  Tang Center for Herbal Medicine Research  Department of Anesthesia and Critical\nCare  University of Chicago  Chicago  IL  60637

American ginseng\n Panax quinquefolius L  are very commonly used herbal medicines in many countries [6–\n7]  Ginseng extracts  especially steamed ginseng extracts  possess significant anticancer\nactivities [8–9]  and confer a radio-protective effect against radiation-induced damage in\nDNA [10]  The major active components of ginseng are ginsenosides  a diverse group of\ntriterpenoid saponins  Fig  1  [11]  The antiproliferative effects of ginseng saponin aglycons \nsuch as protopanaxadiol  PPD  are even greater than those of ginsenosides  Thus \nprotopanaxadiol could serve as a lead compound  since its derivatives may exert better\nanticancer activity [12]  To date  most ginseng studies have focused on the natural\ncompounds isolated from ginseng  Limited work has been done on the synthesis or semi-\nsynthesis of PPD derivatives and their anticancer activity evaluation \n\nWe designed and synthesized a series of PPD derivatives using semi-synthetic methods  Our\nstructure modification was mainly based on reactive sites of PPD  The antiproliferative\neffects of the PPD derivatives on different cancer cell lines were subsequently evaluated \nThe mechanisms of action of selected derivatives were also investigated  Using chemical\nand biological data  we also explored the structural-functional relationship of the PPD\nderivatives \n\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\n\nAll cell culture plastic wares were obtained from Falcon Labware  Franklin Lakes  NJ  and\nTechno Plastic Products  Trasadingen  Switzerland  Trypsin  McCoy’s 5A medium

\n\nPreparation of protopanaxadiol  PPD \nTotal ginsenosides  2 0 g  n-BuOH  250 mL  and sodium hydroxide  10 g  were added to a\n500 mL round bottom flask  The mixture was heated to 130°C while stirring under argon for\n2 days and allowed to cool to room temperature  The reaction mixture was then washed with\nwater  2×100 mL  1% HCl  2×100 mL  5% NaHCO3 and brine  The organic phase was\ndried over MgSO4  The removal of the solvent under reduced pressure resulted in a sticky\noil  which was purified by silica gel column to give PPD  120 mg  and protopanaxatriol\n PPT   110 mg  Since the PPD and PPT were obtained from a group of mixed ginsenosides \nthe yield information was unavailable \n\nSynthesis of PPD derivatives\nCompounds 1–9 were semi-synthesized from PPD  Fig  2  and their structure and purity\n >90%  were confirmed by 1H  13C  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and TLC \n\nCompounds 1 and 2—Pyridine  10 mL  and acetic anhydride  0 5 mL  were added to a\n100 mL round bottom flask containing PPD  120 mg  The mixture was heated to 50°C\novernight while stirring under argon  After the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature \nmethanol  1 mL  was added to quench the reaction  Then  all of the solvents were\nevaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was co-evaporated with toluene  2×20\nmL  The resulting oil was purified by silica gel

and 43 3 µM for Compound 1  while it was more than 60 µM for all\nother compounds  In the SW-480 cell line  the IC50 was 59 6 µM for Compound 3 and 30 0\nµM for Compound 1  while it was more than 60 µM for all of the other compounds  In the\nMCF-7 cell line  the IC50 was 54 7 µM for of Compound 3 and 37 3 µM for Compound 1 \nwhile it was more than 60 µM for all of the other compounds  The leading compound PPD\nshowed an antiproliferative effect at 100 µM  but no effect at 30 µM  Compound 1\nsignificantly suppressed the proliferation of all three cell lines at 30 µM  P<0 01  Although\nthe antiproliferative effect of Compounds 3 and 5 was less than the effect of Compound 1 \nthe compounds had a significantly stronger antiproliferative effect than PPD  Fig  3 \n\nBased on structure and biological activity  we selected PPD and Compounds 1  2  3  and 5\nfor further testing on different cancer cell lines in the dose-sensitive range  The\nantiproliferative effects of PPD and Compounds 1  2  3  and 5 in the three cell lines at 10 \n20  30  40  50  or 60 µM after treatment for 48 h are shown in Fig  4  For the cell line\nSW-480  Compound 1 inhibited growth significantly at 40 µM  P<0 01  and for the\nHCT-116 and the MCF-7 cell lines  its antiproliferative activity was most potent  Fig  3 and\nFig  4 \n\nIn addition  we also selected Compound 1 to evaluate its effects on normal human colon\nepithelial cells  CRL-1831  At a concentration of 20 µM  the proliferation of the\nCRL-1831cells was 96 0%  while it was 81 9% for the HCT-116 cells  P<0 01  At a\nconcentration of 40 µM  the proliferation of the CRL-1831 cells was 80 9%  while it was\n58 7% for the HCT-116 cells  P<0 01  Thus  compared to normal colon cells  Compound 1\nhas a significant cytotoxic effect only on cancer cells \n\nEffects of PPD derivatives on cell cycle distribution in HCT-116 cells\nSince PPD and its derivatives had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells  we explored the\npotential mechanisms through which cell growth was inhibited  The cell cycle profile was\nassayed by flow cytometry after staining with PI  and the assay data from PPD derivatives\nand PPD were compared  As shown in Fig  5  compared to the control  33 3% of G1 phase \n33 7% of S phase  and 26% of G2/M phase  treatment with 30–40 µM PPD did not change\nthe cell cycle profile of HCT-116 cells  At a 50 µM concentration of PPD  the fractions of\ncells in different cell cycle phases were 41 5%  G1 phase  29 5%  S phase  and 14 5%  G2/\nM phase  With the treatment of 50 µM of Compound 3  the cell cycle profile was 65 3%\n G1 phase  19 6%  S phase  and 12 7%  G2/M phase  For the treatment with 40 µM of\nCompound 5  the cell cycle profile was 68 9%  G1 phase  12 3%  S phase  and 10 7  G2/M\nphase  For the treatment with 40 µM of Compound 1  the cell cycle profile was 63 2%  G1\nphase  22 2%  S phase  and 8 2%  G2/M phase  These results suggest that PPD and its\nderivatives arrest HCT-116 cells in the G1-phase \n\nApoptotic effects of PPD derivatives on HCT-116 cells\nAfter treatment with PPD derivatives  especially Compound 1  the viable cell proportions\ndecreased in a dose-dependent manner  In the cell cycle assay  we also observed that the\nnumber of viable cells decreased as the concentration of PPD derivatives increased  To\nfurther characterize the potential mechanism of the anticancer effect of PPD derivatives  we\nperformed an apoptotic assay by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V and PI \nAnnexin V can be detected in both the early and late stages of apoptosis  PI enters the cell in\nlate apoptosis or necrosis  Viable cells were negative for both annexin V and PI  lower left\nquadrant  early apoptotic cells were positive for annexin V and negative for PI  lower right\nquadrant  late apoptotic or necrotic cells displayed both positive annexin V and PI  upper\nright quadrant  non-viable cells which underwent necrosis were positive for PI and negative\n\nDu et al  Page 7\n\nAnticancer Drugs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

PPD\ninduced cell apoptosis in HCT-116 cells  Interestingly  Compounds 1  3  and 5 were more\npotent for inducing apoptosis than PPD  After treatment for 48 h  the percentage of apoptotic\ncells induced by Compound 1 at 30  40  and 50 µM was 26 0%  29 6%  and 53 8% \nrespectively  by Compound 3  the percentages were 9 8%  20 2%  and 34 8%  respectively \nby Compound 5  the percentages were 9 6%  17 3%  and 36 3%  respectively  compared to\nPPD  which was 19 7% at a concentration of 50 µM  Fig  6  These results suggested that\nthe antiproliferative effect of PPD derivatives could be mediated by the induction of\napoptosis \n\nDiscussion\nAlthough botanicals are bioactive  structural modification may be necessary to obtain\neffective drugs from them  Through synthetic chemistry modifications  structural diversity is\npossible  Structure optimization frequently entails modification  removal  or introduction of\nfunctional groups to improve bioactivities [13] \n\nData has shown that one of the health benefits of ginseng root is its potential for anticancer\nactivities [14–16]  In an epidemiological study of over a thousand subjects in Korea  those\nwho used Asian ginseng were at a decreased risk for cancers compared to those who did not\n[17–18]  However  the preventive effect against cancer was not organ specific [18] \n\nThe bioactive constituents in Asian ginseng and American ginseng are dammarane saponins \ncommonly referred to as ginsenosides  Shibata et al  performed the first isolation and\nstructural characterization studies on ginsenosides and their corresponding sapogenins [19–\n20]  The major ginsenosides can be divided into two classes on the basis of the aglycons \ni e  a PPD group and a PPT group  The structural difference between the two lies on the R2\ngroup  Fig  1  The total assignment of 1H-NMR spectra on these two compounds was\ndemonstrated recently [21] \n\nIn previous cancer chemoprevention studies using ginseng constituents  the aglycon of\nginsenosides had a stronger antiproliferative effect than the ginsenosides [22]  Compared to\nPPT  PPD showed more potent anticancer activity [23]  We hypothesized that the anticancer\npotential of PPD could be enhanced by structural modification  To synthesize PPD\nderivatives  we prepared the leading compound PPD by hydrolyzing ginsenosides  Taking\nPPD as the leading compound  we synthesized a series of 9 compounds  most with acetyl\nsubstitutions  Fig  2  The reaction conditions were moderate and the synthesis rates were\nreasonable  Among the 9 compounds  5  Compounds 5–9  are novel \n\nWe determined the antiproliferative effects of all the PPD derivatives on three human cancer\ncell lines  In our in vitro bioassay  PPD and its derivatives had an antiproliferative effect on\nthree cancer cell lines  Compounds 1  3  and 5 showed significantly higher activity than the\nother compounds  Fig  3 and Fig  4  Previous studies reported anticancer activities and\nstructure–activity relationships of ginsenosides [24]  However  no pharmacological\nevaluation was performed using semi-synthesis compounds of ginsenoside derivatives \nespecially PPT derivatives  Our study was the first to evaluate the anticancer effects of a\nseries of novel synthesized PPD derivatives in addition to Compound 1 \n\nAlthough the mechanism by which ginsenosides and aglycons exert their inhibitive activity\non cancer cell growth is largely unknown  several mechanisms are possible  antioxidant\nproperties  regulation of carcinogen metabolism  anti-inflammatory properties cell cycle\nregulation  and induction of apoptosis [2 25–26]  Among these mechanisms  cell cycle\nregulation and apoptosis are important pathways for the inhibition of cancer cells by many\n\nDu et al  Page 8\n\nAnticancer Drugs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nanticancer agents  According to our preliminary morphological observations  the inhibitory\neffects of PPD and its derivatives may not be due to a direct killing of the cancer cells \nRather  they may be due to cell cycle regulation or induction of apoptosis \n\nWith the cell cycle and apoptotic assays we showed that PPD derivatives arrested cancer\ncells in the G1-phase  Compounds 1  3  and 5 reduced the fraction of cells in the G2/M-\nphase  After staining with annexin V/PI  apoptosis of HCT-116 cells by PPD derivatives was\nalso evaluated  Compounds 1  3  and 5 induced apoptosis at concentrations of 40–50 µM for\n48 h  the percentage of apoptotic cells was over 30%  and the ratio of early to late apoptosis\nwas approximately 1 3  The antiproliferative effect of PPD derivatives was mediated by cell\ncycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis \n\nBased on the chemical structures and observed biological activities  we explored the\nstructure-activity relationships of these compounds  First  compared to PPT  PPD exerted\nstronger antiproliferative activity  Hydroxylation at the C6 position negatively influenced its\nantiproliferative potential  Second  structural changes at the C23 did not significantly\nimprove bioactivity  Compounds 6 and 7 both have structure modification at this position \nand they also showed improved activity but less than Compounds 1 and 3  Additionally  this\ndata showed that the acid group would reduce anticancer activity  while a substituent at this\nposition with an epoxy group and hydroxyl group did not affect the activity of Compound 1 \nWhen comparing Compounds 1  2  and 3  it is shown that not only the modification at the\nC23 position  but also acetylation at C12 position would provide negative effects to the\nactivity  Fig  2  Finally  since Compound 1 had the strongest activity  future work should\nfocus on structural modifications at the C3 position while keeping the hydroxyl group at\nC12 \n\nIn this study  we also evaluated cytotoxic effects of the test compounds on normal human\ncolon cells  We selected Compound 1  since it has the most potent antiproliferative effect \nWe observed that after treating with Compound 1  the growth inhibition was significantly\nhigher in cancer cells compared to the normal cells  suggesting that our test compounds have\nselective cytotoxic effects on cancer cells  This toxicity evaluation is consistent with\npreviously reported studies [27] \n\nIn summary  we prepared 9 PPD derivatives using semi-synthetic method  Of these 9\ncompounds  5 compounds  i e  Compounds 5–9  are novel  The antiproliferative activities of\nall 9 compounds on different human cancer cell lines were evaluated  Compounds 1 and 3\nhad significant antiproliferative and apoptotic induction activities compared to PPD and\nother derivatives  Among the 5 novel compounds  Compound 5 possesses the best\nanticancer potential \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis

find new strategies for coping with the uncertainty of\ntheir cancer status [4] \n\nResearchers and health care providers are beginning to recognize the need to help survivors\ndevelop active  behavioral strategies for coping with uncertainty after treatment ends \nPsychosocial interventions are under development with the aim of easing the transition\nfollowing treatment [6 7]  The NCI's Facing Forward guide provides suggestions for\nsurvivors with respect to health practices  stress management  and coping with physical and\npsychosocial problems [8]  There are also guidelines for cancer survivors focused on diet \nphysical activity  alcohol use  and smoking [8-10]  and changes in these health practices are\ncommon  with 40-50% of cancer survivors reporting positive changes in diet [11-14] and\n15-26% reporting increased physical activity [12-14]  While one of these studies [12] used a\npopulation-based sample  it is important to note that prevalence rates could reflect more\nmotivated individuals who are willing to respond to surveys \n\nWhether cancer survivors decide to make lifestyle changes and how they decide which\nbehaviors to change is an important question  Leventhal's self-regulation theory  which is\noften referred to as the “common-sense model”  posits that individuals' cognitive\nrepresentations of their illness guide behavioral responses to illness  such as adherence to\ntreatment recommendations and changes in health practices [15 16]  The key component of\nthis model focuses on “common-sense” or lay beliefs about illness that help individuals to\nmake sense of their illness and  in turn  direct coping efforts  Specifically  the theory\nproposes that common-sense cognitive models of illness can be characterized along five\ndimensions  identity  label and symptoms  cause  consequences  short and long-term effects\nof illness  course  acute  chronic  or recurrent  and control/cure  personal control over the\nillness and how one effects recovery \n\nCommon-sense illness representations have been useful in predicting health practices among\ncancer patients  For example  higher levels of perceived control have been associated with\nuse of integrative therapies  lower likelihood of smoking  and utilization of active coping\nstrategies such as problem-solving and seeking support [17-19]  Cancer patients' causal\nattributions also appear to be important  with findings suggesting that patients who perceive\ncancer causes to be controllable are more likely to engage in positive health practices\n[19-21]  For example  breast cancer survivors who attributed their cancer diet  lack of\nexercise  or alcohol use were more likely to make positive changes in these behaviors [22] \nAlong similar lines  cancer survivors who believed that good health practices were important\nin preventing recurrence were more likely to engage in them [21-23]  However \nrelationships between beliefs about cancer consequences or course and health practices or\nother coping efforts have not been well-studied \n\nMost investigations of the prevalence of lifestyle changes or relationships between cancer\nrepresentations and health practices have utilized cross-sectional designs and have focused\non heterogeneous samples on the cancer survivorship continuum  from recently diagnosed to\nlong-term survivors [e g  13-14  17-21]  We argue that patients' common-sense models of\ncancer may play a salient role in helping patients to “reconstruct a safety net” following the\nend of treatment  Initially  patients have a relatively uniform active means for coping with\ncancer  seeking treatment  Following the completion of treatment  a variety of possibilities\nfor active coping efforts exist  and individual differences in beliefs about cancer may play a\nmore significant role in determining behavioral responses  Consistent with this idea  breast\ncancer survivors have indicated that thinking about causal attributions is more important to\nthem during the recovery period than earlier in the cancer experience [13]  However  this\npotentially “teachable moment” has not been well studied  and was therefore the focus of the\ncurrent investigation \n\nCostanzo et al  Page 2\n\nPsychooncology  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

behavior changes by 3 weeks and 3 months\npost-treatment  and which behaviors they were most likely to change  While we examined\ntraditional health practices  diet  exercise  and alcohol use  we also extended our\ninvestigation to changes in spiritual and religious activities and stress management  among\nothers  A sub-aim was to examine whether women who reported improved health practices\nwere engaging in better health practices than those who did not report improvement  e g \nwhether women who reported increasing physical activity were more physically active than\nothers  The second objective was to characterize women's common-sense beliefs about their\ncancer using Leventhal's model  including beliefs about personal control  consequences \ncourse  causal attributions  and factors believed to prevent recurrence  identity was not\nexamined because participants had already been diagnosed with breast cancer and most\nidentified with this label  The third objective was to determine whether these beliefs  when\nmeasured shortly after the end of treatment  were associated with behavior changes both\nconcurrently and prospectively  We hypothesized that women who perceived greater control\nover their disease  those who perceived cancer to have a more chronic course  and those who\nperceived more severe consequences of their cancer 3 weeks after treatment ended would be\nmore likely to report making lifestyle changes 3 weeks and 3 months post-treatment  We\nfurther anticipated that women would choose to make behavior changes that matched their\ncommon-sense ideas regarding what caused their cancer and what may prevent cancer\nrecurrence \n\nMethod\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for\nstages 0-III breast cancer  Women with recurrent or metastatic cancer were excluded \nParticipants were enrolled from five treatment centers in the Midwest during adjuvant\ntreatment as part of a larger study of post-treatment psychological adjustment [24]  Of 113\nwomen approached to participate  102 subsequently enrolled in the study  an accrual rate of\n90%  A total of 79 participants completed measures 3 weeks after the last date of adjuvant\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy and 71 completed measures 3 months post-treatment \nReasons for nonparticipation or attrition included time constraints and disinterest in\nparticipating in research studies  Participants who did not complete the 3-month follow up\nassessment were not included in prospective analyses examining relationships between\npredictors at 3 weeks and outcomes at 3 month post-treatment \n\nParticipants ranged in age from 32 to 89 years with a mean age of 55 0 years  SD = 10 8 \nAdditional demographic data and disease characteristics are presented in Table 1  Chi-\nsquare analyses indicated that women who were enrolled in  but did not complete the study \ndid not differ from those who completed all time points on disease or demographic\ncharacteristics with the exception of relationship status  Non-completers were more likely to\nbe divorced or separated and less likely to be married or single  χ2 = 10 47  p =  02 \n\nProcedure\nHealth care providers identified eligible patients and solicited the patients' permission to\nmeet with a researcher at an outpatient clinic appointment  all eligible patients during the\nstudy enrollment period were given the opportunity to participate  If the patient gave\npermission  research staff described the study and subsequently reviewed the informed\nconsent document if the patient expressed interested in participating  If research staff could\nnot be present at the patient's appointment  the patient was contacted by telephone \nParticipants were mailed self-report assessments 3 weeks and 3 months following their last\n\nCostanzo et al  Page 3\n\nPsychooncology  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2012 January 1

participants\nsigned informed consent documents approved by the University of Iowa Institutional\nReview Board  and treatment of participants was in accordance with institutional policies\nand American Psychological Association ethical standards  There were no potential conflicts\nof interest identified \n\nMeasures\nHealth Practices—Two aspects of health behaviors were examined  self-reported changes\nfollowing cancer diagnosis  e g  had the participant increased her level of physical activity\nor does she eat more fruits and vegetables  and the extent to which participants engaged in\nhealth practices at the time of the assessments  e g  the amount and intensity of physical\nactivity or number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed daily during the prior two-\nweek period  The behavior change measure was the primary outcome of interest  while the\ncurrent health practices assessment provided a context for behavior change findings \n\nBehavior changes in a variety of domains were assessed and are presented in Table 2 \nWomen were asked to compare their current behavior with their behavior prior to diagnosis\nand rate the direction of change as less or have now stopped  about the same  or more or\nhave now started  Similar response options or categories have been used in other studies of\ncancer survivors' health practices [13 14 19]  The behaviors were chosen based on open-\nended interviews with breast cancer survivors  behavior changes frequently reported by\ncancer survivors in the literature [11-14 25]  and ACS and NCI health practices guidelines\n[8-10] \n\nAll measures of current health practices were cued to the past two weeks  Participants were\nasked to indicate number of packs of cigarettes smoked per week and number of alcoholic\ndrinks consumed per week  These questions have been previously used successfully in\nbehavioral health research [26 27]  We used a modified physical activity measure wherein a\nphysical activity index can be computed by multiplying the number of hours of physical\nactivity by estimates of the relative energy expenditure for activities classified as moderate\nand vigorous [28]  Diet was assessed with Rapid Food Screeners designed to assess top\nsources of fat and fruit/vegetable intake for adults in the United States [29] \n\nCommon-sense models of cancer—The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised\n IPQ-R  assessed participants' beliefs about their illness [30]  Three subscales were of\ninterest  acute versus chronic course  personal control  and consequences  An additional\nsection assesses causal attributions and was modified for the current study to make the\nattributions relevant to breast cancer  Participants were asked to rate the importance of a\nvariety of factors in causing their cancer on a 5-point scale from not at all important to very\nimportant  Participants also rated the importance of various factors in preventing recurrence\non the same scale  Items were chosen from previous studies of breast cancer survivors'\ndisease attributions [13 23]  All items are listed in Table 4 \n\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterize behavior change measures  health practices \nand cancer beliefs  Objectives 1 and 2  Univariate analysis of variance  ANOVA  was\nemployed to compare four key health practices  fat and fruit/vegetable consumption \nphysical activity  and alcohol use  among women who reported a positive change in the\ncorresponding behavior  e g  increased physical activity  to those who did

were then\nemployed to examine prospective relationships between cancer beliefs at 3 weeks post-\ntreatment and behavior changes by 3 months post-treatment  Objective 3  Five behavior\nchanges were selected as outcomes based both on the frequency of their endorsement by\nparticipants and their theoretical and/or practical relevance  e g  ACS and NCI\nrecommendations for health practices  fat consumption  fruit and vegetable consumption \nphysical activity  alcohol use  and stress reduction  Outcome variables were dichotomized as\nmaking a positive change in the behavior  e g  eating more fruits and vegetables  versus not\ndoing so  Because causal attributions and recurrence prevention beliefs were analyzed at the\nitem level  combinations of attributions and outcome variables were specified a priori for\ntesting in logistic regression analyses and are listed in Table 5  Combinations selected were\nbased on our hypothesis that behavior changes would match participants' attributions about\nfactors that may have caused their cancer or can now prevent recurrence \n\nRelationships between other potential covariates and outcomes were analyzed  including\ndisease stage  menopausal status  and treatment regimen  However  there were no significant\nrelationships between these variables and behavior changes beyond effects of age and length\nof treatment  all p values >  10 \n\nResults\nPost-Treatment Behavior Changes and Health Practices  Objective 1 \n\nThe proportion of participants endorsing behavior changes from pre-diagnosis to post-\ntreatment is reported in Table 2  Participants commonly reported changes in health practices\nbut also in other areas  such as increased prayer/meditation and more frequent avoidance of\nstress  Frequencies of key health practices are illustrated in Table 3 to provide context for\nthe behavior change findings  The key finding from the data presented in Table 3 is that\nwomen who reported positive changes on the behavior change assessment typically reported\nbetter health practices than women who did not report positive changes  however \ndifferences were not statistically significant for diet or physical activity measures  p values\n>  10  Women who reported reducing alcohol use 3 months post-treatment reported less\nalcohol consumption than those who did not report this change  F 1  42  = 7 44  p =  009 \nData in Table 3 further suggest that women were doing fairly well with respect to most of\nthe health practices examined  Diets were quite close to dietary recommendations for cancer\nprevention [e g  8-10]  scores on fat and fruit/vegetable screeners indicated participants\nconsumed  on average  32-34% of calories from fat  30% or fewer calories from fat are\nrecommended  and 4 to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily  5 or more servings are\nrecommended  Mean scores on the physical activity measure exceeded the minimum ACS\nguidelines  30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity 5 times weekly  but fell short of the\nmore aspirational guidelines of 45-60 minutes of activity  Women reported consuming very\nlittle alcohol  average of two drinks per week \n\nCharacterization of Common-Sense Models of Breast Cancer  Objective 2 \nMeans provided below represent scores with a possible range of 1  low in belief  to 5  high \nAt 3 weeks post-treatment  women believed they had

IPQ-R from 3 weeks to 3 months post-\ntreatment  p values >  10  Table 4 illustrates the rank order of participants' ratings of factors\nbelieved to have caused their cancer and factors that may prevent recurrence \n\nRelationships between Common-Sense Beliefs and Behavior Changes  Objective 3 \nPersonal control—Personal control was not significantly associated with concurrent  3\nweeks post-treatment  or prospective  3 months post-treatment  changes in the five key\nbehaviors after adjusting for age and length of treatment  Women who perceived greater\npersonal control were marginally more likely to report decreasing fat consumption  Wald\nχ2 1  = 3 55  p =  060  odds ratio = 1 39 and increasing avoidance of stress  Wald χ2 1  =\n3 18  p =  075  odds ratio = 1 16  at 3 weeks post-treatment \n\nAcute versus chronic course—Beliefs about disease course  whether acute or chronic \nalso was not associated with any of the five behavior changes \n\nConsequences—There were no significant concurrent relationships between perceptions\nof disease consequences and behavior changes at 3 weeks post-treatment  Women who\nperceived more severe consequences of their cancer at 3 weeks post-treatment were more\nlikely to report increasing the frequency with which they avoided stress by 3 months post-\ntreatment  however  Wald χ2 1  = 4 41  p =  036  odds ratio = 1 37  They were also\nmarginally more likely to have increased the frequency with which they consumed fruits and\nvegetables  Wald χ2 1  = 3 42  p =  064  odds ratio = 1 28  Perceptions of disease\nconsequences did not significantly predict changes in fat consumption  physical activity  or\nalcohol use \n\nCausal attributions—Combinations of causal attributions and behavior changes tested\nare illustrated in Table 5  Women who attributed the development of their cancer to diet\nwere more likely to report that they had increased consumption of fruits and vegetables \nWald χ2 1  = 5 10  p =  024  odds ratio

recurrence and increased\nphysical activity  Moreover  none of the beliefs at 3 weeks post-treatment predicted\nadditional positive behavior changes at 3 months post-treatment \n\nDiscussion\nFindings from the present study indicate that breast cancer survivors make efforts to make\nlife changes following the end of adjuvant treatment  and changes in health practices are\nparticularly prevalent  Women often reported increasing the frequency of breast self-exam \neating more fruits and vegetables  increasing physical activity  and cutting back on alcohol\nand tobacco use  with more than one-fourth of participants reporting each of these positive\nhealth behavior changes  Moreover  women who reported making these adaptive changes\nwere indeed doing better than their peers on the health practices examined  Breast cancer\nsurvivors also made changes that appeared to be directed toward enhancing emotional and\nspiritual health  with one-fourth of the sample reporting more frequent avoidance of stressful\nsituations or praying or meditating more  Our results suggest that women are poised to make\nimportant lifestyle changes after treatment ends  and this may be a sensitive period for health\npromotion interventions \n\nSuch changes may be driven by survivors' efforts to alleviate concerns about recurrence by\nmaking changes believed to decrease the possibility of recurrence  In fact  most of the\nchanges in health practices match ACS and NCI health guidelines for cancer survivors and\nbreast cancer prevention [8-10]  The changes further appear to reflect individual differences\nin breast cancer survivors' common-sense representations of their cancer  particularly\nperceptions of the severity of impact of breast cancer and attributions about factors that may\nhave caused cancer and may prevent a recurrence \n\nWe characterized the typical profile of breast cancer survivors' common-sense beliefs about\ntheir disease using the model put forth by Leventhal and colleagues [15 16]  On average \nbreast cancer survivors believed they had moderate control over their cancer  they perceived\ntheir cancer to have moderate to severe consequences for their lives  and they saw their\ncancer as more of an acute than chronic condition  although no strongly so \n\nMoreover  women had fairly strong ideas about what may have caused their cancer and what\nthey could now do to prevent a recurrence  Women rated hormones  environmental toxins or\nhazards  and genetics or heredity as the most important causes of their cancer  with more\nthan 70% of women citing these factors as important in the development of their cancer \nfollowed by diet  stress and aging  These attributions are at least somewhat consistent with\ncurrent epidemiological and medical knowledge  Genetics and heredity  along with aging \nare known to be strong risk factors for breast cancer  with hormonal factors  obesity\n reflected in diet and exercise  and alcohol use conferring more modest risk [31]  Despite\ncontroversy regarding links between environmental toxins  such as pesticides  and breast\ncancer  no definitive evidence for a causal link has yet been found [32]  Women frequently\nnamed controllable factors as important in preventing a recurrence  Medical checkups and\nscreenings were seen as most critical in preventing a recurrence  followed by eating a\nhealthy diet  having a positive attitude  exercising  and taking medication  The intriguing\nfinding that 92% of participants believed that a positive attitude was important in preventing\na cancer recurrence is consistent with our previous report of gynecologic cancer survivors'\nrecurrence prevention beliefs [21]  Factors such as God's will and chance were seen as less\nimportant  This pattern of focusing on controllable factors may be psychologically\nprotective  it may be important for women to believe they can play an instrumental role in\npreventing recurrence \n\nCostanzo et al  Page

differences in common-sense beliefs were modestly successful in explaining\nbehavior changes following treatment  with some domains showing greater predictive utility\nthan others  Contrary to our hypotheses  beliefs about personal control and the course of\none's disease were not useful in explaining behavior changes  Beliefs about disease\nconsequences  causal factors  and recurrence prevention were more likely to be related to\npost-treatment behavior changes  and relationships were in the hypothesized directions  For\nexample  women who perceived more severe consequences of breast cancer were more\nlikely to reduce stress and improve their diet  it may be that these women were more\nmotivated to make changes in their health practices  Post-treatment changes frequently\nmatched participants' causal attributions  with those who attributed the development of their\ncancer to diet  lack of exercise  or stress making corresponding improvements in their health\npractices  Changes in health practices similarly corresponded with recurrence prevention\nbeliefs  Women who believed that eating a healthy diet  reducing alcohol use  or reducing\nstress could prevent a cancer recurrence were more likely to make these changes \n\nLimitations of this study include the small sample size and relatively homogenous\ndemographics of the sample  almost all participants were Caucasian  and the vast majority\nwere married and well-educated  The sample may be comprised of a more motivated group\nof individuals who are willing to respond to surveys  although it is important to note that we\nhad a high response rate  90%  Nonetheless  generalizations to other populations of breast\ncancer survivors may be limited for these reasons  In addition  because it was not feasible to\nassess health practices prior to diagnosis  we relied on women's self-reports of behavior\nchanges from pre-diagnosis  which may be subject to recall bias  Finally  it is unclear to\nwhat extent the behavior changes observed are maintained following the immediate post-\ntreatment period  Maintenance of health behavior may be motivated by different\npsychosocial factors than those that lead to initial behavior changes [33]  Future work might\nexamine long-term maintenance of changes in diet  exercise  and substance use  and whether\nwomen are more likely to maintain changes made following treatment as compared to\nchanges made at other times in their lives \n\nNonetheless  results suggest that the immediate post-treatment period is an opportune time\nto encourage and educate breast cancer survivors regarding positive health practices  We\nhave previously reported that breast cancer survivors experience distress following the end\nof treatment related to feeling uncertain as to what they should do for their health [2] \nEducation or other interventions that assist women in identifying appropriate dietary \nexercise  or emotional health goals may assist not only in promoting good health practices\nbut also in alleviating distress  Consistent with the suggestion that breast cancer survivors\nmay be particularly receptive to this type of guidance  79% of breast cancer survivors\nparticipating in a recent study expressed interest in a health promotion program [34]  New\npsychoeducational interventions designed to facilitate post-treatment adjustment by\npromoting active coping and goal-setting also show promising results [6 7] \n\nResults of the present study also provide insight into how women decide to make behavior\nchanges and what changes they decide to make  Breast cancer survivors' beliefs that the\nconsequences of breast cancer are severe  that potentially modifiable or controllable factors\nplayed a role in the development of their cancer  and that controllable factors can prevent a\nrecurrence appear to motivate positive changes in health practices following cancer\ntreatment  Moreover  women make behavior changes that match their beliefs about what\nmay have caused their cancer and what can prevent a recurrence  Recent work suggests that\npsychoeducational interventions targeting common-sense beliefs can indeed help patients to\ndevelop more accurate or adaptive beliefs about their illness [35-37]  and these changes have\nshown positive behavioral outcomes [35]  Assessing attributions and beliefs about cancer  as\nwell as providing tailored psychoeducational interventions and guidance addressing post-\n\nCostanzo et al  Page 8\n\nPsychooncology  Author manuscript

\nbreast cancer treatment more than three decades ago [1]  \nthe eﬃ  cacy of adjuvant chemo therapy has gradually \nimproved by the introduction of the anthracyclines [2] \nand  more recently  the taxanes [3]  However  while \nanthra cycline-containing regimens have become stan-\ndard treatment for oestrogen receptor  ER -positive as \nwell as ER-negative tumours  conﬂ icting evidence has \nlinked the use of adjuvant taxanes to improved outcome \nin patients with ER-positive tumours  Th is uncertainty \nhas now  to a large extent  been resolved with the results \nfrom a recent study [4] revealing a beneﬁ t for ER-positive \ntumours with a high growth rate as evaluated by KI67\nstatus  but no beneﬁ t for ER-positive tumours with a low \nKI67 score  Th ese results indicate a way forward  while \nstudies three decades ago centred on identifying \nprognostic factors in breast cancer  we are now starting \nto learn predictive factors identifying which tumours \nmay achieve optimal beneﬁ t from deﬁ ned therapeutic \nregimens [5]  Th is relates to established drug regimens \nand also to new experimental therapies in parti cular  \nWhile this is conventional wisdom with respect to \ntargeted therapies  such as endocrine agents and anti-\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2  anti-HER-2  \nstrategies  current data illustrate the need for predictive \nfactors to enable optimal use of chemotherapy as well \n\nRealizing the need to identify predictive factors and  \nideally  to understand the mechanisms causing drug \nresistance [6]  translational research aiming at identifying \nsuch biological parameters should be part of most phase I \nto III trials [7]  Before discussing future perspectives and \nthe implementation of novel drugs  a brief summary of \nthe state of the art for predictive factors in breast cancer \ntherapy is provided \n\nPredictive factors in breast cancer treatment\nTh e topic of predictive factors in breast cancer treatment \nhas recently been reviewed in detail by Lønning [8]  thus  \na brief summary will be provided here \n\nWhile a slow tumour growth rate  as determined by \nKI67 expression  has been related to a good prognosis in \npatients on endocrine therapy [9]  high Ki67 expression  \nas well as high histological grade  has been related to \nimproved eﬃ  cacy of chemotherapy  in particular a better \nchance of having a pathological complete response to \nprimary systemic treatment [10-13]  With regards to \nother single parameters  TP53 mutations have been \nassociated with poor response to anthracycline therapy \n[14 15]  but the sensitivity and speciﬁ city of these do not \nallow their implementation in routine clinical use  HER-2 \nampliﬁ cation not only predicts eﬃ  cacy of anti-HER-2 \ntherapies but is associated with enhanced eﬃ  cacy of \nanthracyclines at high doses [16 17]  probably due to co-\nampliﬁ cation of topoisomerase II  an anthracycline \ntarget  in a subset of tumours [18 19]  Th e genes for both \nHER-2 and topoisomerase II are located in close \nproximity on chromosome 17  Interestingly  recent data \nhave suggested centromere ampliﬁ cation on this chromo-\nsome to be a better predictor of anthracycline sensitivity \ncompared to ampliﬁ cation of either HER-2 or \ntopoisomerase II [20] \n\nConsidering gene expression proﬁ les  the OncotypeDX \nsignature  initially developed as a prognostic signature in \npatients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment [21]  has \nbeen evaluated as a predictive factor with respect to \nchemotherapy eﬃ  cacy  Notably  while a low score by this \nindex revealed good prognosis among patients treated \nwith tamoxifen but not chemotherapy  a high score \nsignalled chemotherapy beneﬁ ts with CMF [22] as well as \nanthracycline-containing treatment [23]  So far  the \npredictive value of this signature has been evaluated in \npatients harbouring ER-positive tumours exposed to \ntamoxifen  the potential predictive power of the signature \nwith respect to the eﬃ  cacy of CMF treatment in ER-\nnegative tumours has not been addressed  Several of the \ngenes included in the signature predict cellular \nproliferation rate  thus  it should be evaluated whether \nthe information provided could be reﬂ ected to the same © 2010 BioMed Central Ltd\n\nAre current development programs realising the \nfull

\nsensitivity and speciﬁ city required for clinical imple men-\ntation  see references in [5]  Moreover  the speciﬁ city of \nsupervised gene expression signatures with respect to \nwhich genes are included has been challenged [24] \n\nAs for the hierarchical gene expression signature \ndeveloped by Perou and colleagues [25 26]  tumour \nsubclasses are not fully predictive of chemotherapy \nresponse in either the primary  neoadjuvant  or the \nadjuvant setting [27-29]  While TP53 mutations have a \ntendency to be present in tumours of the HER-2  luminal \nB and basal cell-like classes  they may also be detected \namong tumours belonging to the luminal A class  albeit \nat low incidence [26]  underlining the correlation between \ndiﬀ erent parameters but also tumour hetero geneity  \nprobably the main reason why we have been unsuccessful \nin identifying accurate predictive factors  \n\nDo scientifi c aims need to be redefi ned \nTh e ﬁ ndings summarized above reveal an emerging \nunderstanding of the mechanisms controlling tumour \nresponse to therapy  On the other hand  while some of \nthese parameters are used clinically  such as HER-2 \nampliﬁ cations for anthracycline dose selection  we are \nstill far from the goal of ‘individualized medicine’ - the \nselection of optimal therapy at an individual level based \non predictive factors  To fully achieve such a goal will \nmost probably require extension of our ambitions beyond \nidentiﬁ cation of correlative predictive factors toward \nidentiﬁ cation of the mechanisms causing drug resistance \n\nTh ere may be several diﬀ erent entrances into this ﬁ eld  \nWith regard to novel drugs in clinical trials  two \nimportant examples illustrate unexpected clinical \nobservations that may lead translational research into a \nnew area  and how new drugs may be designed based on \nmolecular translational research identifying molecular \ndefects in tumour subgroups \n\nTh e ﬁ rst example relates to novel drugs implemented \nfor anti-HER-2 therapy  Th e tyrosine kinase inhibitor \nlapatinib inhibits HER-1 as well as HER-2 activity  and \nhas been shown to have anti-tumour activity in tumours \nresistant to trastuzumab [30]  Surprisingly  among \npatients developing resistance to trastuzumab  lapatinib \nand trastuzumab given together improved progression-\nfree survival compared to lapatinib monotherapy [31]  \nSuch observations deﬁ ne an ideal clinical setting from \nwhich tumour samples should be systematically collected \nand analyzed with the aim of identifying the molecular \nmechanisms dictating resistance versus sensitivity to \nthese individual compounds \n\nTh e second approach - the design of therapeutic \nstrategies from knowledge about particular gene defects \n\nin individual tumours - is illustrated by the development \nof poly ADP ribose polymerase  PARP  inhibitors for \nbreast and ovarian cancers in patients harbouring BRCA1 \nor BRCA2 mutations  BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated \ntumours both have a defect in homologous DNA repair \n[32]  Th us  phase II studies have shown PARP inhibitors \nto have speciﬁ c anti-tumour eﬀ ects in breast as well as \novarian carcinomas with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations \n[33]  Interestingly  PARP inhibitors were also found to \nenhance eﬃ  cacy of chemotherapy in triple negative \nbreast cancers not tested for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations \n[35]  Sixty to eighty percent of all triple negative breast \ncancers belong to the so-called basal cell-like class \n[36 37]  and about 80% of all breast cancers arising in \nBRCA1 mutation carriers reveal a gene expres sion proﬁ le \nresembling basal cell-like tumours [26 38 39]  While only \n10% of all basal-like breast cancers arise in BRCA1 \nmutation carriers [40]  the similarity with respect to gene \nexpression proﬁ le between spontaneous basal cell-like \nand BRCA1 mutated tumours has raised the question \nwhether basal cell-like tumours may harbour other \ndefects in the ‘BRCA1’ pathway [41]  However  the role of \nPARP inhibitors in basal cell-like tumours harbouring \nwild type BRCA1 and BRCA2 remains to be determined  \nin a recent study [42] none of 15 patients with advanced \ntriple negative breast cancers responded to a PARP \ninhibitor administered as monotherapy  Currently  we \nlack an explanation for the seeming disparity between the \nstudies by Gelmon and colleagues [42] and O’Shaughnessy \nand colleagues [35] with respect to the eﬃ  cacy of PARP \ninhibition in triple negative breast cancer in general  \nTh ere are several dissimilarities between the studies  one \nevaluating PARP inhibition as monotherapy  the other \naddressing the eﬀ ect of adding a PARP inhibitor to a \ndeﬁ ned chemotherapy regimen  Finally  the studies used \ndiﬀ erent PARP inhibitors  raising the issue of whether \nthese compounds may express additional biological \neﬀ ects  Clearly  more data are needed to address this topic \n\nThe way forward\nSo far  the development of individual predictive factors  \nas well as multigene-expression arrays  has had limited \nimpact on therapy  While our aim should be to identify \nthe functional mechanisms controlling drug resistance  \nthe complexity of the issue should not be underestimated  \nTh e ﬁ nding that nonsense CHEK2 mutations may \nsubstitute for TP53 mutations as a cause of anthracycline \nresistance [15] is consistent with Chk2 activating p53 in \nresponse to DNA damage  and suggests a pivotal role of \nthis mechanism in eﬀ ecting anthracycline-induced cell \ndeath  On the other hand  the p53 protein is subject to \nmultiple modiﬁ cations  including ubiquitinations  de-\nacetylations and phosphorylations at multiple sites \nexecuted by diﬀ erent enzymes  and may directly interact \n\nLønning Breast Cancer Research 2010  12 Suppl 4 S23\nhttp //breast-cancer-research com/supplements/12/S4/S23\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\n\nwith proteins like MDM2 and MDMX [43]  Th us  \nactivation of diﬀ erent cellular processes is most likely due \nto multiple factors acting in concert and modulating the \neﬀ ects of each other  While substantial evidence suggests \nmutations aﬀ ecting a limited number of genes may act as \n‘drivers’ of tumour progression [44 45]  we do not \ncurrently know whether similar phenomena relate to \neither primary or acquired drug resistance in vivo  \nRapidly emerging technologies may allow such analysis \nto be applied to large sets of tumours at reasonable costs \nin the not too distant future [46] \n\nDevelopment of novel techniques for high-throughput \nsequencing opens new possibilities for exploring these \nissues  Th us  techniques are available for screening the \nwhole genome for point mutations as well as indels or \nlarger deletions/duplications  Th us  the ﬁ rst reported \nstudies of this sort on breast carcinomas have revealed \nsubstantial inter-tumour diversity with respect to somatic \nalterations [47] \n\nIn conclusion  new knowledge and new technologies \nnow suggest we should conduct clinical trials diﬀ erently \nto what we have done over the past decades  Th e phase I \nto III trial ‘ladder’ remains  however  instead of \nconﬁ rming marginal beneﬁ ts in repeated large phase III \nstudies  we should concentrate on how we may use these \nnew compounds optimally by exploring drug resistance  \nTo do so  we not only need tumour tissue bank \ncollections  but perhaps more importantly we need to \ndesign our clinical studies  whenever ethically justiﬁ able  \nin a way that aims at exploring drug responsiveness in a \nmanner that allows systematic comparisons between \nclinical response and biological parameters [48]  Th e \nexamples provided by novel anti-HER-2 strategies as well \nas PARP inhibitors both illustrate ways forward \n\nAbbreviations\nER  oestrogen receptor  HER-2  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  \nPARP  poly ADP ribose polymerase \n\nCompeting interests\nThe

Radiology  University of Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh  PA  USA\n\nObjectives  To investigate the feasibility of converting a computer–aided detection\n CAD  scheme for digitised screen–film mammograms to full-field digital mammograms\n FFDMs  and assessing CAD performance on a large database \nMethods  The database included 6478 FFDM images acquired on 1120 females  with\n525 cancer cases and 595 negative cases  The database was divided into five case\ngroups   1  cancer detected during screening   2  interval cancers   3  ‘‘high-risk’’\nrecommended for surgical excision   4  recalled but negative and  5  negative  not\nrecalled  A previously developed CAD scheme for masses depicted on digitised images\nwas converted and re-optimised for FFDM images while keeping the same image-\nprocessing structure  CAD performance was analysed on the entire database \nResults  The case-based sensitivity was 75 6%  397/525  for the current mammograms\nand 40 8%  42/103  for the prior mammograms deemed negative during clinical\ninterpretation but ‘‘visible’’ during retrospective review  The region-based sensitivity\nwas 58 1%  618/1064  for the current mammograms and 28 4%  57/201  for the prior\nmammograms  The CAD scheme marked 55 7%  221/397  and 35 7%  15/42  of the\nmasses on both views of the current and the prior examinations  respectively  The\noverall CAD-cued false-positive rate was 0 32 per image  ranging from 0 29 to 0 51 for\nthe five case groups \nConclusion  This study indicated that  1  digitised image-based CAD can be\nconverted for FFDMs while performing at a comparable  or better  level   2  CAD\ndetects a substantial fraction of cancers depicted on prior examinations  albeit most\nhaving been marked only on one view  and  3  CAD tends to mark more false-positive\nresults on ‘‘difficult’’ negative cases that are more visually difficult for radiologists to\ninterpret \n\nReceived 15 June 2010\nRevised 6 September 2010\nAccepted 13

and\nused clinically as a ‘‘second reader’’ to assist radiologists\nin interpreting mammograms  These CAD systems pro-\ncess digitised or digital images and cue  mark  suspicious\nregions that may depict specific abnormalities  i e  masses\nand/or microcalcification clusters  The second reader\napproach emphasises that radiologists should first read\nand interpret mammograms without CAD followed by\nthe viewing of the CAD results to help highlight the\nregions that were missed and/or underestimated in their\nimportance prior to making a final recommendation  A\nnumber of studies have assessed the impact of using\nCAD on radiologists’ performances when interpreting\nmammograms [1–6]  Some studies have shown that\nradiologists detected more cancers associated with micro-\ncalcifications when using CAD for both screen–film\nmammograms  SFMs  [1] and full-field digital mammo-\ngrams  FFDMs  [6]  while other studies have shown that\nthe use of CAD had little impact on both cancer detection\nand recall rates of the radiologists [2]  or even reduced\n\nradiologists’ performances as measured by the areas\nunder the receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curves\n[5]  Although there is no universal agreement of the actual\nbenefit  if any  when using CAD  in terms of performance\nimprovement [7]  the objective assessment of CAD\nperformance alone is important and has scientific merit \nOur own previous study demonstrated an improvement\nin radiologists’ performances when using ‘‘highly per-\nforming’’ CAD  whereas radiologists’ performances actu-\nally reduced when using ‘‘poorly performing’’ CAD with\nhigh false-positive cueing rates [8] \nA number of previous studies have assessed the per-\n\nformances of commercialised CAD systems alone using\ndifferent image databases [9–15]  Among these  several\nstudies assessed the performances of CAD systems for\nFFDM images  One study reported an 89%  32/36  case-\nbased sensitivity at 0 29 false-positive mass cues per\nimage using the ImageChecker M1000-DM system  v 3 1 \nHologic Inc  Bedford  MA  [13]  and another study re-\nported a 92%  57/62  case-based sensitivity at an overall\nfalse-positive rate of 0 58 per image  including both false-\npositive mass and microcalcification cluster cues  using\nthe SecondLook system  v 7 2  iCAD Inc  Nashua  NH \n[14]  Recently  Sadaf et al [15] reported the largest retro-\nspective study to evaluate CAD performance using FFDM\n\nAddress correspondence to  Dr Bin Zheng  Department of\nRadiology  University of Pittsburgh  3362

date  The database included 127 verified cancer\ncases associated with 5 different types of abnormalities \nThe CAD scheme  SecondLook v 7 2  achieved overall a\n91%  115/127  cancer detection sensitivity  or an 88%  44/\n51  sensitivity on malignant masses \nAs the majority of previously reported CAD schemes in\n\nmammographywere developed for digitised SFM images \nresearchers have also investigated the feasibility of\nconverting the CAD schemes developed for digitised\nSFM images to new CAD schemes for FFDM images and\ncomparing the performance difference between the CAD\nschemes for these two types of images [16  17]  For\nexample  one study reported that two CAD schemes with\nsimilar architecture achieved comparable performance\nlevels for the FFDM and SFM images  e g  70% sensitivity\nat 0 9 and 1 0 false-positive marks per image  by using a\ndatabase of 229 SFM and FFDM examinations depicting\n27 malignant and 104 benign masses [16]  Another study\ninvestigated the feasibility of converting an SFM-based\nCAD scheme to classify between malignant and benign\nmasses depicted on FFDM images without changing the\nstructure of the CAD scheme  Using a data set depicting\n148 malignant and 139 benign masses  the study reported\nthat there was no significant difference from the result of a\nprevious study using SFM images  with an area under the\nROC curve of 0 81 and p50 83  [17] \nDespite these research efforts and the reported high\n\nperformances  the databases used in the previous studies\n[13–17]were limited  In the assessment of CADperformance\nusing digitised SFM images  studies have shown that the\nhigher sensitivity reported in a study using a limited\ndatabase  i e  89% [9]  was often not achievable in large-scale\nassessment studies [1  11  12]  Therefore  owing to the large\nvariation of breast abnormalities and normal tissue struc-\ntures  assembling a large database that can relatively\nsufficiently represent the general screening population is\nimportant to effectively assess or predict CAD performance\nin clinical practice  In this study  we assembled a large and\nunique FFDM image database that included a series of\nmammographic examinations on the same females belong-\ning to one of five categories  groups  and converted our in-\nhouse developed CAD scheme for SFM images into a new\nscheme for FFDM images  An assessment of the CAD\nperformance levels on the entire FFDM image database and\neach of the five case groups  at an operating level similar to\nthat previously used to assess commercial CAD schemes for\nSFM images [12]  is described herein \n\nMethods and materials\n\nThe FFDM image database\n\nUnder an institutional review board-approved proto-\ncol  we ascertained fully anonymised FFDM examinations\nfrom the clinical facilities of our medical centre and\ntransferred the images to our research facility  A group of\nresearch staff ensured that the examinations were fully\nanonymised and generated an outcome ‘‘truth file’’ for\neach of the examinations included in the database  All\nexaminations were acquired using Hologic Selenia\n Hologic Inc  FFDM systems between 2006 and 2008 \nThe honest brokers specifically selected cases that met one\nof the five groups of interest  The assembled database\n\nincluded   1  477 verified cancer cases depicting masses\nthat were detected during mammographic screening\nexamination and confirmed by the followed diagnostic\nwork-up  Group 1   2  48 ‘‘interval’’ cancer cases depic-\nting masses that were detected in the interval between 2\nscreening examinations  Group 2   3  19 patients who had\nbeen recalled during screening for diagnostic work-up of\nmasses that were determined to be ‘‘high-risk’’ pre-cancer\ncases  e g  lobular carcinoma in situ  with surgical excision\nof lesions recommended  Group 3   4  222 patients\nrecalled for diagnostic work-up of masses that were\nultimately determined to be benign  Group 4  and  5  354\nscreening cases rated as ‘‘negative’’  no recall during\nscreening  and later verified by follow-up as negative\nexaminations  Group 5  For each selected case  the FFDM\nimages from the examination in question  as well as prior\nFFDM examinations  if available  were ascertained  After\nan automated de-identification processing to remove all\npersonal information  the images with a new assigned ID\ncode were saved on our computer network server for\naccess by the investigators  All related diagnostic infor-\nmation [e g  breast density Breast Imaging Reporting and\nData System  BI-RADS  ratings  diagnostic reports \npathology-verified abnormality types  location  staging \nage  family history etc ] was also ascertained and recorded\nin a separate code-protected database \nIn summary  the FFDM database included a total of\n\n6478 FFDM images acquired from 1120 females  cases \nAmong these  525 females were positive for cancer\n associated with malignant masses  and 595 were\nbenign or negative  In addition  669 females had only\n1 FFDM examination  namely the current examination \nwhereas 371 had 2  1 current and 1 prior  and 80 had 3  1\ncurrent and 2 prior  FFDM examinations during the period\nin question  2006–2008  In 525 verified cancer cases  136\nhad 2 examinations and 38 had 3 examinations  Thus  a\ntotal of 1651 FFDM examinations were available to this\nstudy  Among these examinations  737 had been per-\nformed on females with detected cancer  Among the 595\nnegative  or benign  cases  suspicious masses had been\ndetected in 159 cases and the diagnostic work-up resulted\nin 19 recommended operations for lesion excision  The\ndistribution of the cases in this study is summarised in\nTable 1 \nAfter assembling the FFDM image database  a three-\n\nstep process  namely a review  a verification and a final\nconfirmation  of identifying and marking the centre of the\nmass  as well as circular margins encapsulating the mass\nin question  was performed by experienced scientists and\nradiologists with the aid of information from de-identified\nsource documents provided by the honest brokers  The\nfinal confirmation was performed by an experienced\nradiologist  This information was saved as the truth file\nfor performance testing  Table 2 summarises the distribu-\ntion of the marked mass regions in three different\ncategories of cases  In this database  a total of 1673 mass\nregions of interest were marked  including 1265 regions\nassociated with cancer and 408 associated with benign\nmasses  In the retrospective review  201 mass regions\nassociated with 103 cancer cases were marked on the\nimages acquired from the prior examinations of these\ncases that had been either missed or interpreted as\nnegative during the original screening \n\nB Zheng  J H Sumkin  M L Zuley et al\n\ne154 The British Journal of Radiology  June 2012\n\n\n\nThe computer-aided detection scheme\n\nA detailed description of our CAD scheme for\ndigitised SFM images has been reported elsewhere [12 \n18]  The performance of this CAD scheme has been\ntested and compared with two leading commercial CAD\nschemes using a large independent clinical database \nComparable performance levels were achieved for all\nthree CAD schemes [12]  In this study  we first applied\nour SFM-based CAD scheme to the entire FFDM\ndatabase  We found that the sensitivity was 8 8%  46/\n525  and the false-positive rate was 0 12 per image\n 776/6478  To understand the reasons for this perfor-\nmance degradation  we randomly selected a set of FFDM\nimages depicting marked mass regions  We then visually\nexamined the CAD-generated mass boundary contours\nand analysed the recorded image features  We found that\n 1  a large fraction of the CAD-defined mass regions\ndepicted on the FFDM images were only partially\nsegmented  smaller than the visually identified region \nand  2  the pixel value-related features  i e  contrast  pixel\nvalue standard deviation  were saturated  assigned to\nthe maximum value  As the FFDM images had a\nsubstantially higher contrast resolution and a larger\npixel value variation  in absolute terms  than the\ndigitised SFM images  the previously optimised CAD\nscheme based on the SFM images was not appropriate\nfor the FFDM images  We adopted the following steps to\nconvert the CAD scheme while maintaining the same\narchitecture and the three image-processing stages \nThe first stage of the scheme uses a difference-of-\n\nGaussian filtering method to identify suspicious regions \nIn this stage  we proportionally adjusted kernel sizes of\nthe Gaussian filters and thresholds for region sizes in\ndetecting the initial suspicious regions to compensate for\nthe pixel size difference between the SFM and FFDM\nimages  This stage typically identifies between 10 and 50\n\nsuspicious regions per image depending on breast tissue\ndensity and pattern distribution  The upper level of the\nscheme’s sensitivity is determined by this stage  The\nsecond stage of the scheme applies a multilayer topo-\ngraphic region growth algorithm to segment mass\nregions  In this stage  we adjusted the difference in\nregion growth thresholds for each topographic layer to\ncompensate for the increases in mass region contrast \nBased on measurements of average contrast for all\ndetected mass regions in our FFDM database and\ncompared with the results of our previously recorded\naverage contrast for all mass regions depicted in our\ndigitised SFM database  we found that the average\ncontrast of mass regions depicted on the FFDM images\nwas approximately 80% higher  Thus  we increased\nregion growth thresholds by 25% at each of the 3 layers\nto approximately compensate for the total differences\n 80% vs 3625%575%  of the contrast levels of the masses\ndepicted on the two types of images  We also adjusted all\nsize- and contrast-related classification rules implemen-\nted in the scheme to compensate for differences in pixel\nsizes and image contrast levels  This step typically\nreduces the number of suspicious mass regions to fewer\nthan five per image \nAfter computing a set of image features for each\n\nsegmented suspicious mass region  the third stage of the\nscheme applies a multifeature-based artificial neural\nnetwork  ANN  to generate a detection score indicating\nthe likelihood of the segmented region being positive  In\nthis stage  we retrained the ANN using the FFDM images\nto account for the feature value changes  The ANN used\nexactly the same 14 input features and 4 hidden neur-\nones as previously reported [19]  From CAD-segmented\nsuspicious mass regions  we randomly selected 500 true-\npositive and 500 false-positive regions to generate a\ntraining data set  The ANNwas retrained under the same\ntraining protocol as that previously implemented to train\n\nTable 1  Case distribution of the full-field digital mammogram  FFDM  image database that included 1120 cases with a total of\n6478 FFDM images  by case

threshold were cued as\nthe mass regions while the other regions were discarded \nFigure 1 shows an example of applying this CAD scheme\nto four FFDM images acquired from one examination of a\n48-year-old female diagnosed with cancer \n\nPerformance assessment\n\nAfter conversion  we applied our new CAD scheme to\nall 6478 FFDM images  For each detected and segmented\nsuspicious mass region  CAD generated a detection\nscore  First  all recorded CAD scores were analysed\nusing a previously developed Free-response receiver\noperating characteristic  FROC -type data analysis\nmethod [22]  Second  using an operating threshold at\nthe same level as previously implemented for testing\n[12]  we computed the actual CAD-cueing performance \nincluding sensitivity  false-positive rate per image and\nfraction of images or examinations without false-positive\ncues  Performance levels were assessed for the entire\nimage database and for each of the five case groups  as\nwell as for the current and the prior examinations  As\ncurrent CAD schemes detect a high fraction of masses\nonly in one view [23] and clinical studies have shown\nthat radiologists are more likely to discard masses cued\nby CAD only in one view as false positives [3  4]  we\nreported both case-based and region-based performance\nlevels  In the case-based analysis  a mass was counted as\ndetected if it was cued by CAD on either one or both\nviews of the same examination  In the region-based\nanalysis  each mass region was independently counted \nAs the CAD scheme is intended to be used as a second\n\nreader  the lower the correlation between CAD-cueing\nresults and radiologists’ true-positive detections  the\nhigher the probability that CAD would help to improve\nradiologists’ performances  Previous studies suggest that\nabnormalities with low contrast  small size [24] or low\nconspicuity [25] are more difficult to detect  Therefore \nwe also analysed the ability of CAD to detect subtle\nmasses by computing correlations between CAD-gener-\nated detection scores and the values of two image-based\nfeatures  namely region conspicuity [26] and integrated\ndensity that is equivalent to estimating the actual\n‘‘physical mass’’ of a region by combining the size of\nthe mass and difference in density levels  or pixel values \nbetween pixels within the detected mass region and the\naverage density of the surrounding region or back-\nground tissue [27]  High correlations suggest that CAD\ntends to detect ‘‘easy’’ masses that may also correlate\nwith detection results by radiologists  whereas low\ncorrelations suggest that CAD can detect at least a\nfraction of ‘‘difficult’’ masses that are more likely to be\nmissed by radiologists without CAD \n\nResults\n\nOur FFDM database has the following characteristics\nthat may relate to CAD performance  First  the majority\nof cases  namely 58 2%  652/1120  and 3 6%  40/1120 \nwere rated as heterogeneously dense  BI-RAD 3  and\nextremely dense  BI-RAD 4  respectively  Figure 2\nshows the distribution of breast tissue density as rated\n\nby the radiologists during the original interpretations \nSecond  the majority of detected mass margins were\nrated by radiologists as either irregular or spiculated \nAmong the 525 verified malignant masses  the boundary\nmargins of 464 masses were actually rated by radiolo-\ngists  Among these  11  2 4%  were described as smooth \n293  63 1%  as irregular  123  26 5%  as spiculated and 37\n 8 0%  as focal asymmetry  Third  for the 174 cancer\npatients who had 2 or 3 serial mammograms  Table 1 \nwe found that 59 2%  103/174  of the masses were\n‘‘visible’’ or actually depicted on prior examinations in\nthe retrospective review \nFigure 3 displays three region-based normalised per-\n\nformance curves that show the results of the ‘‘training’’ \nthe initial testing of the re-optimised ANN and the\noverall performance when applying ANN to the entire\ndata set  We note that the entire data set included all\nregions selected for training and testing plus 20 addi-\ntional true-positive and 20 727 false-positive regions \nmaking the total number of tested regions include\n1020 true-positive and 21 727 false-positive regions  The\n‘‘pooling’’ was deemed reasonable as the areas under the\nperformance curves  AUCs  were 0 879¡0 007 for the\ntraining data set  0 871¡0 007 for the testing data set and\n0 865¡0 005 for the entire data set  The maximum\ndifference among the three AUC values was only 1 59% \nThe CAD scheme initially detected 1025 malignant\n\nmass regions distributed in 507 cases  which represented\nan upper limit of 96 6%  507/525  case-based sensitivity\nand 81 0%  1025/1265  region-based sensitivity  At this\nstage  21 727 false-positive regions on 6478 images  3 35\nper image  were also identified  The upper limits of\nsensitivity for the prior examinations were 81 6%  84/\n103  and 72 1%  145/201  for the case-based and region-\nbased detections  respectively  Figure 4 shows two case-\nbased FROC-type performance curves that included all\ninitially detected suspicious mass regions depicted on\nthe current and the prior examinations \nTable 3 summarises the actual CAD sensitivity levels\n\non mass detection after applying the operating threshold\nto the five different case groups of our

examinations and\n40 8%  42/103  for the prior examinations  The overall\nregion-based sensitivity levels were 58 1%  618/1064  for\nthe current examinations and 28 4%  57/201  for the\nprior examinations  In current examinations  the CAD\nscheme cued 55 7%  221/397  of masses on both views \nwhile only 35 7%  15/42  of masses depicted on the prior\nexaminations were cued by the CAD scheme on both\nviews  Although the CAD scheme had slightly higher\nsensitivity in cancer cases  Group 1  than in interval\ncancer cases  Group 2  in the current examinations\n 75 9% vs 72 9%  the CAD scheme had substantially\nlower sensitivity levels in Group 1 than in Group 2 in the\n\nprior examinations  35 0% vs 60 9%  which is probably\nthe result of shorter time intervals between sequential\nexaminations in the interval cancer group  approxi-\nmately 6 months on average rather than 12 months or\nlonger  This makes the use of CAD potentially more\nbeneficial in the interval cancer group \nThe CAD-generated false-positive rate in the entire\n\ndata set was 0 32  2070/6478  per image  ranging from\n0 29 to 0 51 marks per image in the 5 different case\ngroups  Table 4  These false-positive cues were distrib-\nuted on 26 1%  1692/6478  of the images or 58 1%  960/\n1651  of the examinations  resulting in a 73 9% image-\nbased specificity and a 41 9% examination-based speci-\nficity  In general  the more difficult negative case groups\n i e  high-risk pre-cancer cases with surgery excision and\nrecalled but negative cases  had higher false-positive\ncueing rates than the easy negative case group  i e  not\nrecalled screening negative cases \nTwo computed Pearson’s correlation coefficients\n\nbetween the CAD-generated scores and the two image\nfeatures for all initially detected 1025 mass regions were\n0 558  p 0 0001  for region conspicuity and 0 307\n p 0 0001  for integrated density  Figures 5 and 6 show\nhistograms of all detected mass regions as related to\nthese two image features  before and after applying the\noperating threshold to the CAD-generated detection\nscores  The large diversity of the mass regions depicted\nin this database is noted  as well as the diversity of the\nmass regions actually marked as positive by the CAD\nscheme  Namely  CAD was able to detect  cue  a fraction\nof the difficult mass regions exhibiting low conspicuity\nand/or small integrated density \n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough previous studies have investigated the\nfeasibility of converting the CAD schemes developed\nfor SFM images to new schemes for FFDM images [16 \n17] and assessed CAD performance using limited FFDM\ndatabases [13–15]  this study is a more comprehensive\nassessment study that included a number of unique\ncharacteristics  First  we used a larger and more diverse\nFFDM database that included sequential FFDM exam-\ninations acquired from 1120 females  To the best of our\nknowledge  no such large-scale CAD assessment study\nusing an FFDM database has been previously reported \nThe use of a large and diverse database increases the\nreliability in assessing CAD performance  Second  unlike\nprevious studies that reported CAD performance levels\non one testing  general  database  we compared and\nreported CAD performance levels on different categories\n subdatabases  of cases  including the current and prior\nexaminations  The results of our study indicate the large\ndifference of the CAD performance levels in different\ncase categories  Third  since CAD is used as a second\nreader  reducing the correlation between radiologists\nand CAD schemes in detecting breast cancer  i e \nmalignant masses  is important in clinical practice  We\nalso preliminarily assessed the correlations between the\nCAD-cued results and the two image features that are\nconsidered to be correlated with the difficulty of visual\ndetection \n\nFigure 3  Three region-based normalised performance\ncurves for the

2012\n\n\n\nAfter demonstrating that direct application of an SFM\nimage-based CAD scheme to the FFDM images resulted\nin the substantial degradation of performance  we used\nthe same scheme structure  approach  to re-optimise the\nCAD scheme by changing only a limited number of\nvariables/parameters  In our previous assessment study \nusing a subset of an SFM database that included a group\nof cancer cases with only current examinations  two\ncommercial CAD schemes and our own CAD scheme\nachieved 72 4%  70 7% and 67 2% case-based detection\nsensitivities at the corresponding 0 39  0 27 and 0 27\nfalse-positive detections per image  respectively [12]  In\n\nthis study  the ‘‘converted’’ CAD scheme achieved a\n75 6% case-based sensitivity at 0 32 false-positive detec-\ntions per image for a comparable case group  albeit with\na different data set by necessity  The result suggests that\nthis simple approach can yield a CAD performance level\nthat is as good as  or better than  a CAD performance\nlevel for SFM images [12]  This is largely due to better\ncontrast resolution  detection quantum efficiency and\nsystem linearity \nSimilar to the previously reported study in assessing\n\nperformances of CAD schemes for SFM images [28]  our\n\nTable 4  Computer-aided detection-cued false-positive rates in different groups of full-field digital mammogram cases

regions  namely 40 8%  42/103  of\nmasses associated with cancer that were deemed ‘‘retro-\nspectively visible’’ on prior examinations but that were\neither missed or interpreted as negative during the\noriginal clinical study were detected  In this study  44 3%\n 176/397  of masses depicted on the current FFDM\nimages were cued by CAD only on 1 view  As expected \nowing to the increase in subtleness of masses depicted on\nthe prior examinations  a larger fraction of these  64 3% \nwere cued by CAD only on 1 view  These results are\nconsistent with our previous observations using SFM\nimages [12  23]  The false-positive rate was higher in the\nhigh risk with surgery excision but benign group  0 51 \nand the recalled  with biopsy  but negative group  0 41 \nthan the group of screening negative without recall\n 0 29  Although the previous study reported that CAD\ntypically cued more false positives on the images\ndepicting denser breast tissue [29]  the increase of false-\npositive cues in the suspicious negative case groups in\nthis study is not related to the difference in breast\ndensity because the breast density BI-RADS rating\ndistributions are relatively similar across all case groups\n Figure 2  The results seem to suggest that current\nCAD-cueing results on the false positives are correlated\nwith the ‘‘ease’’ level of interpretation as performed by\nradiologists \nFalse-positive detection per image is the most popular\n\nindex to report CAD performance  i e  used for plotting\nFROC curves  in previous studies  However  since the\nCAD-cued false-positive cues are not uniformly distrib-\nuted in the images of a database  some images can depict\nmultiple false-positive cues  The fraction of images or\nexaminations  cases  without CAD-cued false positives\nshould be a more useful index in the screening environ-\nment  In this study  the false-positive rate of the CAD\nscheme was 0 32 per image  while the fractions of images\nand examinations depicting false-positive marks were\n0 261 and 0 581  respectively  Hence  the image-based\nspecificity was 73 9% and the examination-based specifi-\ncity was 41 9%  As radiologists typically read four images\nper examination  the examination-based specificity\nshould be a clinically relevant index of CAD performance \nAs a result  in order to detect 75 6% of the cancers  58 1%\nexaminations depicted at least 1 CAD-cued false-positive\nmass mark in our database  Thus  to increase radiologists’\nconfidence in CAD results for mass detection  additional\nreduction in the false-positive cueing rates remains an\nimportant and highly warranted objective \nAlthough detection sensitivity of current CAD\n\nschemes may remain relatively low  i e   80%  CAD\ncan be a valuable tool to be used as a second reader if\nthere is a lower correlation between the radiologists’\ninterpretations and the CAD cueing results  We recog-\nnised that assessing such a correlation was a very\ndifficult task that had not been fully investigated in\nCAD assessment studies  In this study  we did a few\npreliminary and simple data analyses  By assuming that\nradiologists are more likely to miss the masses with\nlower conspicuity  or smaller integrated density values\n[24–27]  we analysed and computed the correlation\nbetween CAD-generated detection scores and these two\nimage features  The results  Figures 5 and 6  suggested\nthat CAD was able to cue  or flag  some of the difficult\n\nmasses with low conspicuity and small integrated\ndensity values  The results also support that CAD can\nbe a useful tool to help radiologists detect more subtle\ncancers  in particular to further reduce its false-positive\ndetection rate \nThe study also has a number of limitations  First  our\n\ndatabase included all available sequentially ascertained\nscreening-detected cancer cases during the period of\ninterest  However  the non-all-inclusive selection of\nnegative cases may not be optimal for this purpose  as\nwe selected only 595 negative cases from a very large\npool of negative cases  Based on the limited assessments \nthe negative data set in this study seemed to represent \non average  relatively dense breasts  Second  in convert-\ning the CAD to be applicable to FFDM images  we\nindeed needed to retrain the scheme and  in particular \nthe ANN  This could affect somewhat the robustness and\ngeneralisability of our results  however  the very com-\nparable performance levels achieved on the training \nthe testing and the entire data set suggested that the\nrandomisation and training protocol we implemented  at\nleast partially  reduced biases  Third  we tested the CAD\nperformance in detecting masses and we cannot com-\nment on the feasibility of a similar conversion process in\nthe detection of microcalcification clusters  However \nmost CAD schemes achieve very high sensitivity of\ndetecting microcalcification clusters  e g   98% [26] \nwhen applied to digitised SFM images  hence  we do\nnot believe that this is a major concern primarily because\nof the improved contrast sensitivity associated with the\nFFDM images  e g  100% [15]

\ngranulocytes  NK and dendritic cells  DC  The adaptive immune system is composed of\nantibody-producing B lymphocytes  as well as CD4pos helper T cells and CD8pos cytotoxic\nT cells  These cells work together to sense  control and eliminate infection  Agents of innate\nimmunity identify microbes through special pattern recognition receptors that sense\nbiochemical structures  usually non-proteins  common to broad classes of potential\npathogens  1  On the other hand  T and B lymphocytes specialize in responding against\nantigens  usually proteins  specific to the individual species of microbe  DCs have a unique\nrole in that they form a critical bridge between innate and adaptive immunity  Pattern\nrecognition proteins belonging to the Toll-like family of transmembrane receptors  2  induce\na maturation and migration program whereby various DC populations  including monocyte-\nderived DCs  convey peripherally-acquired proteins to T cells located in the regional\ndraining lymph nodes  3  The DCs “present” the microbial antigens to T cells in the form of\nprocessed peptides complexed with self major histocompatibility proteins  4  This supplies\nan important signal  signal 1  to T cells that  along with maturation-enhanced co-stimulatory\nmolecule  CD80  CD86  expression  signal 2  can fully activate T cells  5  DCs and some\nother accessory cells can supply so-called “third signals”  6  that often are expressed in the\nform of soluble factors  for example  IL-12  IL-23  IL-6 and TGF-beta  Such signals can\nprofoundly influence helper T cell development toward discrete functional phenotypes that\ninclude IFN-γ-secreting Th1  IL-17- secreting Th17  as well as anti-inflammatory Treg that\nproduce TGF-beta and IL-10  7–10  In many instances  the precise combination of\nactivation signals received by DC dictates whether individual 3rd signal agents will be\nproduced  and hence which Th phenotypes will be selectively induced by the DC  11 \n\nAlthough the immune system evolved primarily to deal with infections  it may be possible to\ndirect it against malignancies  An ideal strategy for inducing anti-tumor immunity must\nsuccessfully accomplish several goals-some of which are overlapping with traditional anti-\nmicrobial vaccines  but others unique to the particular requirements of effective anti-tumor\nimmunity  For example  an effective anti-tumor vaccine must overcome the immune\nsystem’s natural tendency to resist the development of strong immunity against self-proteins\n i e  tolerance  It must also generate immunity of a quality and intensity likely to reduce or\neliminate tumor burdens  In the case of therapeutic vaccines  immunity must be effectively\ninduced when disease is already firmly established  Finally  such induced immunity should\nbe durable  so that possible tumor recurrences can be suppressed for long periods post-\nimmunization \n\nWe formulated a novel  integrated DC-based immunization system designed to overcome\nsome of the known obstacles facing anti-cancer vaccines  We call this strategy ICAIT\n Immune Conditioning via Activated Innate  autologous  Transfer  Here  CD14pos\nperipheral blood monocytes  which represent a precursor pool for activated DC  were\nrapidly activated into fully-functional DC in vitro with IFN-γ and a special clinical-grade\nbacterial endotoxin  LPS  LPS signals through the Toll-like pattern recognition receptor\nTLR4  12  mimicking infection and inducing a mature phenotype coincident with the\nproduction of a unique battery of secreted products  not seen with most commonly-\nemployed DC activation regimens  including high levels of the Th1-polarizing third-signal\n\nKoski et al  Page 2\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript

tumor peptide antigens based on the\nHER-2/neu sequence  representing HLA-A2  13–14  and promiscuous HLA-Class II-\nrestricted epitopes  15  so that both Th and CTL could potentially be activated  The ICAIT\nDCs were then administered directly to the lymph nodes of subjects with early HER-2/\nneupos breast cancer  ductal carcinoma in situ  Recall responses to HER-2 peptides were\nmonitored for up to 52 months post immunization  We report high rates of sensitization and\ndurable immune responses with the ICAIT immunization approach \n\nMETHODS\nClinical trial design\n\nWe conducted a pilot trial of a HER-2/neu-based DC immunization strategy for patients\nwith HER-2/neu over-expressing DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion  The primary objectives\nwere to evaluate the feasibility  safety and immunogenecity  i e  CD4pos and CD8pos T cells\nsensitized to HER-2/neu  of the immunization regimen  ICAIT DC were administered\nintranodally once per week for 4 weeks followed by definitive surgical resection of\nremaining tumor  A maximum of 30 patients were to be enrolled in order to establish safety\nand have adequate power to evaluate pre- versus post-ICAIT T cell sensitization status by\nMcNemar’s test  If no occurrence of unacceptable toxicity was observed in the 30 patients \nthen the rate of unacceptable toxicity was no higher than 7% based on the upper-bound of\nthe one-sided exact 90% confidence interval \n\nFeasibility  defined as the rate of patients who received all 4 immunizations on schedule \nwas 100%  Toxicities were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Grading Scale Version\n3 0  Sensitization of CD4pos and CD8pos T cells was assessed in pre- and post-ICAIT\nperipheral blood samples and in sentinel lymph nodes where available  Eligible patients\nwere greater than 18 years old  signed Informed Consent  had ECOG performance status 0\nor 1  and presented with biopsy-proven DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion but had not yet\nreceived definitive treatment  Patients whose DCIS was eliminated by excisional biopsy at\ndiagnosis were not eligible  HER-2/neu positivity was determined as >10% cells expressing\n2+ or 3+ intensity of the HER-2/neu protein  Patients with areas suspicious of invasive\ndisease were evaluated by MRI  All subjects underwent cardiac evaluation with MUGA scan\nor echocardiography to document adequate baseline cardiac function  Scans were performed\nprior to immunization and within 2 weeks of the final ICAIT treatment  All patients\nunderwent HLA Class I tissue typing pre-enrollment and had routine history  physical\nexams  EKG  blood work  and urinalysis prior to immunization  After informed consent  all\nsubjects underwent pre-ICAIT leukapheresis to obtain sufficient monocytes for ICAIT\npreparation  in a few cases a second apheresis was required for additional monocytes  Post-\nICAIT leukapheresis was performed usually within two weeks of the final immunization \nAll patients underwent post-ICAIT mammogram  MRI and surgical resection of DCIS with\neither lumpectomy or mastectomy  Patients could be candidates for either lumpectomy or\nmastectomy  Patients were followed for 30 days post-ICAIT treatment in order to assess\nsafety and to undergo second leukapheresis  Long term immunologic surveillance  i e  serial\nblood sampling  was not mandatory and was conducted on a voluntary basis only

Pennsylvania  They consisted of 10–20 million\nHER-2/neu-pulsed ICAIT DCs suspended in 1ml sterile saline  ICAIT DCs were\nadministered  aided by ultrasound guidance  into a single lymph node in each groin as\npreviously described  16  Half of each ICAIT DC dose was placed into each node with a\n22g needle  The first 9 subjects were observed for 2 hours post-immunization with routine\nvital signs obtained at 15-minute intervals  Subsequent subjects were observed for one hour \nImmunizations were administered once weekly for four weeks  All subjects completed all 4\nscheduled ICAIT

Harvest was timed to recover the cells prior to their maximum secretion of\nIL-12 and other cytokines  For HLA-A2 1pos subjects  cells were also pulsed with MHC\nclass I binding peptides 369–377 and

for an\nadditional hour  The plates were washed and 100μl of substrate solution was added to each\nwell  After color development  wells were rigorously washed with tap water  The plates\nwere dried at

subjects that received ICAIT DC pulsed with additional HLA-A2\nbinding peptides  369–377 and 689–697   13–14  each potentially capable of sensitizing\nCD8pos T cells  The capacity of each HLA-A2 1pos ICAIT-immunized subject’s CD8pos T\ncells to produce IFN-γ in response to T2 target cells pulsed either with HER-2 peptide  or\nirrelevant control peptide is displayed in Figure 3  with a summary of numbers of responders\nalso provided  Figure 3 inset  Eleven of 13  84 6%  95% exact CI 64 – 99 8%  subjects\nwith sufficient available blood CD8pos T cells to test demonstrated evidence of peptide\nreactivity to 369–377  and seven of 13  54%  also developed reactivity to 689–697  It should\nbe noted that there was only a single subject that demonstrated reactivity to one of the class I\npeptides  369–377  prior to ICAIT immunization  Interestingly  these subjects’ CD8pos T\ncells also showed  after ICAIT treatment  a tendency to directly recognized HLA-A2pos\nbreast and ovarian cancer cell lines that both over-express HER-2/neu plus the appropriate\nHLA-A2 1 restriction element  Figure 4  A representative subject is shown in Figure 4  In\nfact  11/13  84 6%  subjects displayed recognition  assessed by IFN-γ secretion  of HER-2/\nneu-expressing tumor cells  but not those that were HLA A2neg or those that did not express\nHER-2/neu  Table 1  One of these subjects had evidence of tumor recognition prior to\nvaccination 080102-09  Table 1  These data confirm that ICAIT therapy resulted in CD8pos\nT cell sensitization against HER-2/neu peptides in a large proportion of immunized subjects \n\nICAIT treatment induces anti-HER-2/neu CD4pos immunity\nELISPOT assays were performed directly on unexpanded patient PBMC  There were three\nsubjects with insufficient cells to perform ELISPOT and in vitro sensitization leaving 22 for\nevaluation  These showed that 22 of 25  88%  95% exact CI 68 8 – 97 5%  subjects  CD4pos\nT cells  experienced at least two-fold increases in the ratio of HER-2/neu peptide-specific\nIFN-γ secreting cells  post-ICAIT immunization compared to pre-ICAIT  for at least one of\nthe six tested peptides  Figure 5  Nineteen of these 25  76%  95% exact CI 54 9 – 90 6% \nsubjects demonstrated such ICAIT-enhanced responses to more than one peptide  ELISA\nresults from in vitro sensitization assays confirmed the anti-HER-2/neu responses in these\npatients  data not shown  There was no evidence of IL-5 or IL-4 production by these cells\nusing ELISPOT or IVS  data not shown  The pre-post ratio of tetanus spots was always less\nthat 2  suggesting the sensitization seen of CD4pos T cells to HER-2/neu was specific to\nvaccination not just non-specific immune activation \n\nIdentification of lymphocytes trafficking to sites of DCIS and analysis of anti-HER-2/neu\nCD4pos T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes\n\nICAIT DCs were administered in distant groin nodes with the expectation that they would\nefficiently sensitize lymphocytes within these secondary lymphoid tissues  However  to be\neffective  node-sensitized lymphocytes must traffic to sites of disease  We therefore\nperformed immunohistochemical analysis comparing pre-ICAIT breast biopsies and post-\nICAIT surgical specimens to determine whether increased levels of lymphocytes could be\nobserved around sites of DCIS as an apparent consequence of ICAIT immunization  Fig\n6A  In pre-treatment biopsy specimens  it was common to observe low to moderate levels\nof lymphocytes scattered in the stromal regions outside the DCIS-containing ducts \nHowever  for about 50% of subjects assessed  we observed post-ICAIT increases in CD4pos\n Th  and CD8pos  CTL  T cells  as well as CD20pos cells  which were probably B\nlymphocytes  Not only were the lymphocytes more numerous  their distribution within the\nbreast tissues was greatly altered  with the infiltrating lymphocytes now crowding close\naround the DCIS-containing ducts  forming pronounced “collars”  In addition  we noted that\nprior to vaccination no lymphocytes could be routinely observed within the DCIS lesions \nHowever  after ICAIT treatment  CD8pos cells were detected among the tumor cells  Figure\n6B  It should be noted that the subject depicted in Figure 6 was not an HLA-A2 1pos\n\nKoski et al  Page 7\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013

peptides  but not the\n369 or 689 HLA-A2 1-binding CTL epitopes  In addition  we did not observe any changes\nconsistent with increases in CD56pos NK or DCs  not shown \n\nThese immunohistochemical studies showed post-ICAIT increases in lymphocytic\ninfiltration at areas of DCIS  but could not prove the actual antigen specificity of the\ntrafficked cells  Because assessment of T cell antigen specificity even within fresh DCIS\nspecimens is not practical  we instead recovered lymphocytes from the tumor-draining\nsentinel lymph nodes that were excised at the time of surgery to remove residual DCIS  We\nreasoned that if HER-2/neu-specific T cells were entering diseased breast tissues  some of\nthem would  as part of their natural tendency to re-circulate  transit through the draining\nlymph nodes  Unexpanded CD4pos T cells obtained from draining sentinel nodes showed\nHER-2/neu-specific responses in 21 of 22  95 5%  95% CI 77 2 – 99 9%  subjects from\nwhom such sentinel nodes were available  Fig 7  This high proportion suggests that T cells\nsensitized at remote locations  i e  anatomically distal lymph nodes  via ICAIT do routinely\ntraffic to the site of disease in the breast \n\nICAIT treatment induces long-lasting immunity\nSome patients voluntarily gave additional blood at various times ranging from 6 months\nthrough 52 months post-ICAIT immunization  Thirteen of 14 patients from whom PBL were\nobtained at least 6 months after completion of the study demonstrated reactivity to one or\nmore HER-2/neu peptides by ELISPOT assay  Figure 8  The data shown are ELISPOT\nresults obtained from PBL stimulated only once with recall peptide without any prior in\nvitro expansion  Even in follow-up beyond two years  there remained robust anti-HER-2/neu\nCD4pos reactivity for many subjects  including all three individuals who were assessed\nbeyond 48 months  The long-term responses to HER-2 were of such intensity that they were\nin the range or sometimes exceeded even the magnitude of the recall response against\ntetanus toxoid in 22 of the 25 samples tested  These results are particularly encouraging\nsince long-lasting immunity  though often difficult to achieve against tumor antigens  is\nprobably key for preventing disease recurrence \n\nDISCUSSION\nBecause the term “dendritic cell” encompasses a fairly diverse set of cell types with unique\nlineages and functions  there is presently no clear consensus which type of DC or DC\nprecursor  or which activation regimen  is best suited for use in vaccine development  A\nseminal discovery in DC research was that peripheral blood monocytes could be made to\nadopt the characteristics of immature DC if cultured for a week or more in cytokines such as\nGM-CSF and/or IL-4  24–26  with mature DC phenotypical features obtainable through\nfurther culture with inflammatory cytokine combinations or other activating agents  18  27–\n28  These findings were of great practical importance because unlike most DC populations \nCD14pos monocytes are relatively abundant in peripheral blood  about 10% of total WBC \nmaking them a highly convenient source of DC for in vitro studies and clinical use \nHowever  it remained uncertain whether the monocyte-derived cells were “authentic” DC\nrather than merely DC-like cells  Also at issue was whether monocytes represented a\nbiologically-relevant precursor pool for DCs in vivo  or if the previous observations were\nmerely an artifact of in vitro culture and activation  Part of this doubt stemmed from an\ninability to define an anatomical compartment where monocytes would be exposed to\ncytokines long periods  29 \n\nThe question as to whether monocytes can become functionally authentic DC seems now\nlargely put to rest with the report that mouse monocytes can be mobilized to develop into\nDCs in vivo in a TLR4- and Trif-dependent manner when driven by bacterial LPS or gram-\n\nKoski et al

bacteria  living or killed  This transformation is rapid  leads to monocyte-derived\nDC trafficking to T-dependent areas of draining lymph nodes  and results in acquisition of\nantigen presenting function equal or in some cases superior to “authentic” non monocyte-\nderived DCs  3  These studies not only establish monocytes as a bona fide precursor to\nauthentic DCs in vivo  but also reinforce the notion that simulating actual infection  with\nagents such as LPS  rather than aseptic inflammation  using cytokine cocktails  induces\ncells with exquisitely-developed DC function \n\nOur group has pioneered the use of mimics of infection to drive the rapid in vitro\ndifferentiation of monocytes into DCs  30–32  with the ultimate goal of using such cells as\nplatforms for immunization  To this end  we have also formulated a novel  integrated DC-\nbased immunization strategy to maximize vaccine effectiveness  This approach harvests\nCD14pos monocytes from the peripheral blood  but places them  after antigen loading and\nLPS-activated DC differentiation  directly into lymph nodes  which serve as the cradles for\nT cell-dependent immune responses  16  33  Historically  the removal of a tissue and its\nreplacement at a new location within the donor is termed an “autologous transfer”  This\nvaccine strategy also relies uniquely upon the specialized cytokine/chemokine environment\ncreated by the LPS-activated DCs in the lymph node  These soluble products have the\npotential to exert a critical influence over many aspects of T lymphocytes functional\ncapacity  discussed below  The tandem use of cytokine-secreting DCs  and their placement\ndirectly into lymph nodes rather than injecting them at peripheral sites   where they may\nneedlessly expend these factors  means that the lymph node T cells are not merely sensitized\nto antigen  but also “conditioned” by the soluble factors that drive the acquisition of\nspecialized and desirable functional characteristics  Because of these innovative features  we\nrefer to this vaccination system as ICAIT  Immune Conditioning by Activated Innate\n autologous  Transfer \n\nThere were several reasons to predict that combining IFN-γ with LPS would induce vaccine\nDCs that would serve as unusually active vehicles for generating strong  long-lasting Th1-\npolarized immunity against tumors and tumor antigens  For example  this combination\ninduces extremely high levels of many soluble products from maturing DCs not seen with\nconventional activation regimens  Fig 2  Among these factors  IL-12 in particular possesses\na number of activities well-documented in vitro and in animal models  which are highly\nsupportive of anti-tumor immunity  For example  IL-12 is known to polarize CD4pos Th\ncells into the IFN-γ-secreting Th1 phenotype  34  and IFN-γ has been shown to be a critical\nfeature in effective anti-tumor immunity  35  In addition  IL-12 contributes to avoiding\ntolerance  enhancing granzyme B production  improving cytotoxicity  and also prolongs T\ncell survival through a Bcl-3-mediated mechanism  36–38  Finally  its presence during\nCD8pos CTL sensitization has been shown in vitro to enhance functional avidity  i e  antigen\nsensitivity  making the T cells better at recognizing targets with low levels of specific\npeptide MHC complexes  39  Considering these precedents  it was therefore not\nunreasonable that DCs pulsed with HER-2/neu peptides and activated with LPS and IFN-γ\nshould be capable either of inducing de novo or enhancing anti-HER-2/neu CD4pos T cell\nresponses in well over 80% of immunized subjects  As might be expected  the cytokine\nsecretion profiles for all subjects tested demonstrated strong Th1 polarization  high IFN-γ\nwith low or absent production of other cytokines such as IL-4  IL-5 and IL-10  Also  11 of\n13 HLA-A2 1pos immunized subjects produced CTL that directly recognized tumor lines\nthat naturally over-express HER-2/neu  This finding is of particular interest because it has\nproven notoriously difficult to achieve such direct recognition of tumors  40  41  despite the\nfact that such direct recognition is probably critical for anti-tumor CTL activity in vivo  Our\nearlier in vitro studies suggested that IL-12 produced by DC at the time of CTL sensitization\nendowed the T cells with the capacity to recognize both peptide-pulsed T2 targets and\nantigen-expressing tumor cells in 85% of the healthy donors tested  owing to enhancements\n\nKoski et al  Page 9\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript

vitro sensitization studies using T cells\nand DC from healthy donors almost precisely anticipated the rates of sensitization leading to\ndirect tumor recognition observed in this in vivo  neoadjuvant immunization trial using\nsimilar IL-12-secreting DCs \n\nOne particularly interesting feature that could not be anticipated from our earlier in vitro\nwork was the tendency of ICAIT-sensitized T cells to traffic to areas of disease  Although\nprior to ICAIT treatment  lymphocytes could be seen scattered about the breast tissues  they\nwere rarely  if ever  observed within the DCIS lesions themselves  After ICAIT treatment \nhowever  the number of lymphocytes in breast tissues greatly increased for many subjects \nThese cells tended to congregated densely about the DCIS-containing ducts  with CD8pos\nCTL even crossing the epithelial border and mingling with the actual tumor cells  Moreover \nwe observed CD8pos infiltrates even in cases where the treated subjects were HLA-A2 1neg \nand therefore received neither the 369 nor the 689 peptide CTL epitopes as part of their\nimmunization  Thus the presence of CTL within these tumors after immunization suggests\neither that stimulation of Th cells is somehow recruiting endogenously-sensitized CTL  or\nthere are nested CTL epitopes within the promiscuous class II peptides that can be processed\nand cross-presented to CD8pos cells in the ICAIT-treated individual  In either case this bodes\nwell for the sensitization of critical CTL even in instances where we cannot know and\nprovide precise HLA class I-binding CTL epitopes as part of the ICAIT treatment\nadministered to HLA-A2 1neg individuals \n\nAnother feature of the ICAIT DC that warrants comment is their demonstrated “killer DC”\nfunction  especially in relation to the “gold standard” CMC-DC  It had been shown\npreviously by others that human monocyte-derived DCs are capable of adopting a somewhat\nunexpected effector function characterized by the ability to induce apoptotic death in diverse\ntumor cells  This capacity could be induced by such activating agents as type I interferons\n 42  and double-stranded RNA  43  Similar findings were also reported with bacterial LPS\nacting on pre-committed peripheral blood DC  44  with further augmentation observed in\ncombination with IFN-γ  The ICAIT DC in our study showed that this latter combination\nalso efficiently induced killer DC function in monocyte-derived DC  Although we have not\nyet determined whether the killing is mediated through TNF  TRAIL or some other\nmechanism  this observation suggests additional therapeutic approaches incorporating\nICAIT DC  For example  in addition to injecting ICAIT DC into lymph nodes for T cell\nsensitization and conditioning  they could conceivably be introduced to the site of disease\n tumors  There  the activated DCs could serve as effectors to promote direct tumor killing \nthereby releasing additional tumor antigens to further drive T cell sensitization and\nexpansion  In addition  the secreted cytokines and chemokines made by ICAIT DC could\nserve to enhance target homing of the T lymphocytes sensitized in the lymph nodes  The\nlocally-secreted products could also conceivably alter the microenvironment of the tumor\nitself to favor acute inflammation and tumor destruction \n\nIn summary  the ICAIT approach utilizing LPS and IFN-γ-activated DC resulted in high\nrates T cell sensitization to synthetic HER-2/neu class I- and class II-restricted peptides  The\nsensitizations were particularly unusual in their durability  extending up to 52 months  their\ntendency to induce T cells capable of direct tumor recognition  and the capacity of ICAIT-\nsensitized lymphocytes to traffic to and penetrate sites of disease  These results  coupled\nwith recent findings that LPS-activated mouse monocytes acquire most potent DC function\n 3  strongly suggest that LPS-activated monocyte-derived DCs should be further explored as\nplatforms for inducing enhanced anti-tumor immunity in humans \n\nKoski et al  Page 10\n\nJ Immunother  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

breast cancer  survival  prevention  epidemiology\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere is convincing evidence for an inverse relationship between physical activity and\nbreast cancer with many studies reporting a 20% to 30% decreased risk of developing breast\ncancer for those who are physically active  and most reporting a dose-response relationship\n[1  2]  The inverse relationship of breast cancer with physical activity has been consistently\nobserved in both cohort and case-control studies and across many subgroups including both\npre- and postmenopausal women  intensity of physical activity  and appears to be\nindependent of obesity and hormone receptor status [3  4]  Further  a recent review suggests\nthat recreational physical activity  rather than occupational  household  and transportation  is\nassociated with the greatest decreases in risks observed for physical activity on breast cancer\noccurrence [4]  Similar mechanisms for breast cancer risk and survival are thought to be\ninvolved  including direct reduction in exposure to sex steroid hormones  reduced insulin\nand insulin-like growth factors  modulation of inflammation and indirectly through reduced\nadiposity [5]  Therefore  increasing physical activity is a promising preventive measure for\nreducing risk of death after a breast cancer diagnosis \n\nWhile there is ample evidence supporting a reduction in breast cancer risk for higher levels\nof physical activity  fewer studies have examined whether exercise influences mortality\namong breast cancer survivors  Both case-control and cohort studies have investigated this\nassociation  most finding an inverse association between physical activity and survival\n[6-11]  However  only a few studies have investigated intensity of recreational physical\nactivity on breast cancer survival [9  11  12]  and to our knowledge  no studies have\nevaluated the effect of the timing of physical activity during the lifetime on survival after\nbreast cancer diagnosis \n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether the amount  intensity  duration and timing\nof prediagnostic physical activity influences risk of death after a breast cancer diagnosis in\nthe Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project  population-based cohort of women with breast\ncancer \n\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\n\nThis study draws on data that were collected from participants as part of the Long Island\nBreast Cancer Study Project  LIBCSP  a population-based study of English-speaking\nresidents of Nassau and Suffolk counties of Long Island  New York [13]  LIBCSP\nparticipants were women newly diagnosed with a first  primary in situ  or invasive breast\ncancer between August 1  1996  and July 31  1997  Women were identified using a rapid\nreporting system established specifically for the LIBCSP and were confirmed by physician’s\nand medical records  The attending physician was contacted to confirm study eligibility and\nto seek permission to contact the patient  Institutional review board approval of the study\nprotocol was obtained from each collaborating institution and participating hospital and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from each participant before the interview  A total of\n1 508 women with breast cancer  of which 1 273 had invasive breast cancer  participated in\nthe LIBCSP baseline  case-control study interview  which was administered shortly after\n\nCleveland et al  Page 2\n\nEur J Cancer Prev  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\ndiagnosis  As part of the LIBCSP follow-up of the case women  vital status through the end\nof 2002 was determined through the National Death Index  NDI \n\nData Collection\nBaseline Data—The lifetime physical activity and most of the covariate data used in this\nanalysis were collected as part of the LIBCSP baseline interview  The main questionnaire\nwas administered in-home by a trained interviewer and took ~2 hours to complete \nInformation obtained from the main questionnaire includes reproductive and menstrual\nhistory  exogenous hormone use  family history of cancer  body size  physical activity \nsmoking history  alcohol intake  and demographic characteristics  Nearly two thirds of\nbaseline case interviews occurred before initiation of chemotherapy [13]  Descriptive\ncharacteristics for the entire LIBCSP study have been previously published [13] \n\nAs part of the baseline interview  participants reported participation in recreational physical\nactivity  RPA  using an instrument which was a modification of that developed by Bernstein\nand colleagues [14  15]  Participants were asked about all recreational physical activities in\nwhich they had engaged for at least one hour per week for at least three months or more in\nany year over their entire lifetime  but prior to the breast cancer diagnosis  Activity\ninformation recorded was the name of the activity  the ages the activity was started and\nstopped  the total years of participation in the activity  the number of months per year and\nthe number of hours per week the activity was usually performed \n\nTreatment and Tumor Characteristic Data—Information on treatment undergone for\nthe first primary breast cancer is based on response at baseline and during follow-up  Nearly\ntwo-thirds of participants with breast cancer completed their baseline interview prior to the\ninitiation of chemotherapy  therefore additional treatment information was obtained by\ntrained interviewer via telephone from 1 098 case participants or their proxy in 2002 to 2004\nand by re-abstracting medical records  There were 410 cases without follow-up interview\ndata due to non-response  refusal  untraceability  or death without an identifiable proxy \n\nData on estrogen receptor  ER  and progesterone receptor  PR  status were gathered from\nmedical records of 1 402 women who signed a medical release form  Treatment and tumor\ncharacteristic data were abstracted for 598 women  A high concordance was found between\ninformation abstracted from records and self-reported radiation therapy  κ = 0 97 \nchemotherapy  κ = 0 96  and hormone therapy  κ = 0 92  Thus  for this study  the analysis\nis based on self-reported treatment at the baseline and follow-up interviews \n\nStudy Outcome—For the LIBCSP follow-up study  the NDI was used to ascertain all-\ncause and breast cancer-specific mortality among study participants  Because most women\nwho die from their breast cancer will do so within five years of diagnosis [16]  we are\nreporting survival after 5 years of follow-up  Participants were followed from diagnosis until\nDecember 31  2002  Among the 1 508 women diagnosed with breast cancer  198  13 1% \ndeaths occurred  Based on International Classification of Diseases  ICD  codes 174 9 and\nC-50 9 listed as a primary or secondary code on the death certificate  128  64 6%  deaths\nwere due to breast cancer  Cases without a death record in the NDI database were\ndetermined to be alive as of December 31  2002 \n\nVariable Definitions\nRecreational Physical Activity—Among participants classified as ever having\nparticipated in recreational physical activity  a duration-frequency measure was calculated\nusing the reported number of hours per week of participation summed across all activities\nfor each year of a woman’s life  This combination duration and frequency measure was\n\nCleveland et al  Page 3\n\nEur J Cancer Prev  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\ncalculated as hours per week of activity and examined among all women  This variable was\nthen further divided among subcategories of specific time periods during the lifecourse\nincluding RPA over the lifetime  expressed as hours per week of RPA from menarche to\ndiagnosis  premenopausal RPA  for postmenopausal women only  RPA from menarche up\nto menopause  RPA from onset of menopause to diagnosis  and recent RPA  within 10\nyears prior to diagnosis  There were 1 504 case women who had a valid response for\nphysical activity \n\nMetabolic equivalent task  MET  scores were assigned to each reported activity using a\npublished database as a guide [17]  One MET is defined as the energy expended when\nsitting quietly  which is equal to 3 5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per\nminute  or one kilocalorie per kilogram of body weight per hour [17]  This MET score was\nthen multiplied by the number of hours per week the subject reported engaging in the\nactivity to derive MET-hours per week  MET-h/wk  that were averaged for annual activity\nlevels  MET-h/wk  for the specific lifecourse time periods described above  Use of this\nmeasure in analyses allowed for simultaneous examination of activity duration  and\nfrequency in relation to risk of breast cancer  Total RPA was further classified according to\nintensity  where low intensity activities were defined as those expending  6 months before\nthe date of diagnosis or if both ovaries were removed before the date of diagnosis  Women\nwith unknown menopausal status were categorized as postmenopausal based on the 90th\npercentile for age at menopause in the control population from the baseline study  and\ncalculated according to smoking status  ≥54 8 yrs for smokers and ≥55 4 yrs for non-\nsmokers \n\nStatistical Methods\nLifetime RPA was defined as RPA from menarche to diagnosis  RPA analyses were also\ncarried out for the life periods from menarche to menopause  menopause to diagnosis  and\nrecent RPA  within 10 years prior to diagnosis  To reduce the possibility that RPA by life\nperiod associations we observed were due to the differences in sample size  the analyses for\ntiming of RPA was restricted to women who had a reported RPA measure at each time\npoint  Physical activity variables were classified as MET-h/wk in categories defined as 0  >0\nto 8 9  and 9 or more MET-h/wk  These cutpoints were selected based on Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine\nrecommendations for physical activity [18] as well as for consistency with other\n\nCleveland et al  Page 4\n\nEur J Cancer Prev  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 January 1 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

used to generate survival curves by RPA category  data\nnot shown  Cox proportional hazards regression [20] was used to estimate hazard ratios\n HR  and 95% confidence intervals  95% CI  for the risk of all-cause and breast cancer-\nspecific mortality  Participants with in situ disease were excluded when calculating breast\ncancer-specific mortality estimates  Proportional hazards assumptions were verified with\nSchoenfield residuals  No violation of this assumption was found  The results for overall and\n5-year survival were similar  therefore  only overall survival is reported  Tests of trend were\nconducted using the continuous values for RPA \n\nEffect measure modification on the multiplicative scale between categorical RPA variables\nand other covariates was evaluated using the log likelihood ratio test to compare\nproportional hazards regression models with and without the cross-product terms [20]  To\nassess for potential heterogeneity  we evaluated effects stratified by variables  which\nincluded exogenous hormone use  never used hormones  ever used hormones  body mass\nindex  median BMI = weight in meters/height in meters squared  menopausal status\n premenopausal  postmenopausal  and family history of breast cancer in a first-degree\nrelative  no family history  family history  Associations were also evaluated by\nstratification on the tumor characteristics ER

substantially alter the estimates of\neffect therefore all models include only age at diagnosis and BMI in the year prior to the\ndiagnosis  Models including both pre- and postmenopausal women were also adjusted for\nmenopausal status \n\nTo further explore possible confounding by tumor characteristics and treatment  we\nconducted separate analyses restricted to women for whom we have complete tumor\ncharacteristic and tumor treatment data  There were no differences in effects or evidence of\nconfounding by these variables for the relationship between RPA and mortality  All analyses\nwere carried out using SAS version 9 1 [22] \n\nRESULTS\nThere were 196 deaths identified  128 due to breast cancer  Mean follow up was 66 7\nmonths  range  2 7-88 6  Distributions of select characteristics by total MET-h/wk of RPA\nfrom menarche up to diagnosis among women with breast cancer are shown in Table 1 \nWomen who engaged RPA during this time tended to be younger at diagnosis  more likely\nto have completed high school  had a lower BMI and were more likely to have taken\nexogenous hormones than those who were inactive  There was little difference in estrogen\nreceptor or progesterone receptor status in physically active women compared with inactive\nwomen \n\nResults for analyses that examined the association between overall lifetime physical activity\nand intensity

63  95% CI=0 43-0 91  No\nsignificant trends were observed for reduced mortality with increasing MET h/wk of RPA\n data not shown \n\nWe also investigated the effect of intensity of RPA on death outcomes  Moderate intensity\nlifetime RPA also resulted in decreased mortality  where those who reported ever regularly\nengaging in moderate RPA had lower risk of death attributed to breast cancer

who engaged in vigorous intensity physical activity \n\nThe 5-year survival for premenopausal women who engaged in any lifetime RPA was 93%\nand 85% for inactive women  Figure 1a  Similarly  among postmenopausal breast cancer\nparticipants the 5-year survival from any cause was 90% for active women and 83% for\ninactive women  Figure 1b  Associations were similar  although slightly attenuated  for\nbreast cancer-specific mortality  We further evaluated the association of lifetime RPA\nstratified by menopausal status and found no evidence of statistically significant interaction\n P for interaction = 0 48  Lifetime RPA among premenopausal women was associated with\nmodest decreases in all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality regardless of MET h/wk\nof activity  any RPA vs  no RPA  HR =0 53  95% CI=0 28-0 97  HR =0 54  95%\nCI=0 27-1 05  respectively  although there were no apparent trends for reduced risk of\ndeath with increasing RPA  Table 3  Similar  although attenuated  reduced associations that\napproached statistical significance were seen for low levels of RPA up to 8 9 MET-h/wk and\nhigh levels greater than 9 0 MET-h/wk among postmenopausal women \n\nWhen considering the timing of physical activity among postmenopausal women  we\nobserved that engaging in exercise after menopause was associated with a reduced risk of\ndeath due to all causes  whereas there was no effect for physical activity which took place\nbefore menopause  Table 4  Compared with inactive women  those who engaged in 9 MET-\nh/wk or more of RPA after menopause had a 67% lower risk of death  HR=0 33  95%\nCI=0 17-0 63  P for trend = 0 002  Results for breast cancer-specific mortality were similar \nbut not as strong as those seen for deaths from all causes  Postmenopausal women who\nengaged in physical activity in the 10 years prior to diagnosis showed similar results for all-\ncause mortality as those seen for RPA after menopause  ≥9 MET-h/wk vs  no RPA  HR =\n0 33  95% CI=0 18-0 61 \n\nAnalyses of overall and breast cancer mortality stratified by BMI is shown in Table 5  We\nobserved no decreasing trend in overall or breast cancer-specific mortality observed

Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is important for tumor initiation and progression  The low density lipoprotein\nreceptor-related protein-6  LRP6  is an essential Wnt co-receptor for Wnt/b-catenin signaling and represents a promising\nanticancer target  Recently  the antihelminthic drug  niclosamide was found to inhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling  although the\nmechanism was not well defined  We found that niclosamide was able to suppress LRP6 expression and phosphorylation \nblock Wnt3A-induced b-catenin accumulation  and inhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling in HEK293 cells  Furthermore  the\ninhibitory effects of niclosamide on LRP6 expression/phosphorylation and Wnt/b-catenin signaling were conformed in\nhuman prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells  Moreover  we showed that the\nmechanism by which niclosamide suppressed LRP6 resulted from increased degradation as evident by a shorter half-life \nFinally  we demonstrated that niclosamide was able to induce cancer cell apoptosis  and displayed excellent anticancer\nactivity with IC50 values less than 1 mM for prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells  The\nIC50 values are comparable to those shown to suppress the activities of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in prostate and breast\ncancer cells  Our data indicate that niclosamide is a unique small molecule Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibitor targeting the\nWnt co-receptor LRP6 on the cell surface  and that niclosamide has a potential to be developed a novel chemopreventive or\ntherapeutic agent for human prostate and breast cancer \n\nCitation  Lu W  Lin C  Roberts MJ  Waud WR  Piazza GA  et al   2011  Niclosamide Suppresses Cancer Cell Growth By Inducing Wnt Co-Receptor LRP6 Degradation\nand Inhibiting the

formation when aberrantly\n\nactivated  A hallmark of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling activation is\nthe stabilization of cytosolic b-catenin  which enters the nucleus to\nactivate Wnt target genes by binding transcription factors of the T-\n\ncell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor  TCF/LEF  family [1 2]  In\n\nthe absence of Wnt ligands  b-catenin levels are efficiently\nregulated by a supramolecular complex containing adenomatous\n\npolyposis coli  APC  axin  and glycogen synthetase kinase 3b\n GSK3b  This complex promotes phosphorylation of b-catenin by\ncasein kinase 1  Ck1  and GSK3b  Phosphorylated b-catenin\nbecomes multi-ubiquitinated  Ub  and degraded by the 26S\n\nproteasome  The action of this complex is inhibited upon the\n\nbinding of Wnt to its receptors on the cell surface [1 2]  A variety\n\nof Wnt/b-catenin target genes have been identified  including\nthose that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis  thus mediating\n\ncancer initiation and progression [3–5]  Compelling evidence has\n\nindicated that there is an abnormal up-regulation of this pathway\n\nin tumorigenesis of many types of cancer  and that disruption of\n\nWnt/b-catenin signaling represents a great opportunity to develop\nnovel drugs for cancer chemoprevention and therapy [6–8] \n\nExperiments performed in drosophila [9]  xenopus [10] and\n\nmice [11] demonstrated that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-\n\nrelated protein 5  LRP5 /LRP6  termed arrow in drosophila  acts\n\nas a co-receptor for Wnt ligands  which interact with both the\n\nseven transmembrane receptor of the Frizzled  Fz  family and\n\nLRP5/6 to activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway  The\n\ncytoplasmic tails of LRP5/6  upon receptor activation by Wnt\n\nligand  are phosphorylated  and recruit the cytosolic scaffold\n\nprotein axin to the membrane  LRP6 is expressed in human\n\ncancer cell lines and up-regulated in human malignant tissues\n\n[12–16]  Studies in the past years have demonstrated that LRP6 is\n\na promising therapeutic target for the development of novel\n\nanticancer drugs [6–8 15 17 18] \n\nNiclosamide  trade name Niclocide  is a teniacide in the\n\nantihelmintic family that is especially effective against cestodes \n\nwhich infects humans  Niclosamide has been FDA approved for\n\nsuch indications and has been used in humans for nearly 50 years\n\n[19–21]  It is believed that niclosamide inhibits oxidative\n\nphosphorylation in the mitochondria of cestodes  an aerobic\n\nPLoS ONE | www plosone org 1 December 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 12

signaling\n[22 23]  and suppress colorectal cancer growth and metastasis\n\n[23 24]  Since the mechanism was not well defined  we further\n\nstudied this  We demonstrated for the first time that niclosamide\n\ncan inhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling by inducing LRP6 degrada-\ntion  and that this activity is closely associated with its\n\nantiproliferative and apoptosis inducing activity \n\nResults\n\nNiclosamide blocks Wnt/b-catenin signaling induced by\nWnt3A and LRP6 by suppressing LRP6 expression in\nHEK293 cells\nUncomplexed cytosolic b-catenin  free b-catenin  is the active\n\nform of b-catenin that is translocated to the cell nucleus to activate\ntranscription factors of the TCF/LEF family  leading to the\n\ntranscription of Wnt target genes  To determine if niclosamide can\n\ninhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling  HEK293 cells were treated for\nwith Wnt3A conditioned medium  CM  in the presence of\n\nniclosamide or vehicle  DMSO  The levels of cytosolic free b-\ncatenin and total cellular b-catenin were then examined by\nWestern blotting  As shown in Figure 1A  niclosamide was able to\n\nblock Wnt3A-induced cytosolic free b-catenin and total cellular b-\ncatenin accumulation in HEK293 cells at concentrations as low as\n\n0 6 mM  Figure 1A \nLRP6 is an essential Wnt co-receptor for the Wnt/b-catenin\n\nsignaling pathway  and LRP6 phosphorylation is critical for Wnt/\n\nb-catenin signaling activation induced by Wnt proteins [25–28] \nTo explore the molecular mechanism underlying Wnt/b-catenin\nsignaling inhibition by niclosamide  we examined LRP6 expres-\n\nsion and phosphorylation after niclosamide treatment  As shown in\n\nFigure 1A  treatment of Wnt3A CM markedly induced endoge-\n\nnous LRP6 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells  which was\n\nabolished by niclosamide treatment  Importantly  we also found\n\nthat the total cellular level of endogenous LRP6 was greatly\n\ndecreased after niclosamide treatment in HEK293 cells\n\n Figure 1A \n\nTo confirm the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on LRP6\n\nexpression and phosphorylation  we performed a Wnt/b-catenin\nsignaling reporter assay to test whether niclosamide is able to\n\ninhibit Wnt/b-catenin signal activation by LRP6 and Wnt3A \nHEK293 cells were transiently transfected with LRP6 along with\n\nWnt/b-catenin signaling reporter TOPFlash  and treated with\nWnt3A CM and niclosamide  As shown in Figure 1B  LRP6\n\nexpression increased the TOPFlash activity in HEK293 cells \n\nwhich was further enhanced when the cells were transfected with\n\nLRP6 and treated with Wnt3A CM  Figure 1B  Moreover  the\n\nincreased TOPFlash activity induced by LRP6 or LRP6 plus\n\nWnt3A CM was blocked by niclosamide  Figure 1B \n\nNiclosamide suppresses LRP6 Expression and\nPhosphorylation and Blocks Wnt/b-catenin Signaling in\nProstate and breast cancer cells\nTo determine if niclosamide can block Wnt/b-catenin signaling\n\nin cancer cells  we examined the level of cytosolic free b-catenin\nafter niclosamide treatment  We found that cytosolic free b-\ncatenin levels in human prostate PC-3 and breast MDA-MB-231\n\ncancer cells were significantly reduced after niclosamide treatment\n\n Figure 2A  Furthermore  when PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells\n\nwere transiently transfected with the Wnt/b-catenin signaling\nreporter TOPFlash  we found that the niclosamide treatment\n\ngreatly reduced the TOPFlash activity in PC-3 and MDA-MB-231\n\ncells  Figure  2B \n\nIt is well recognized that axin2 is a specific transcriptional target\n\nof the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway  and that the expression\nlevel of axin2 is the signature of the activation of Wnt/b-catenin\n\nFigure 1  Effects of niclosamide on Wnt3A and LRP6-induced\nWnt/b signaling in HEK293

LRP6 and phospho-LRP6  p-LRP6  were examined  All\nthe samples were also probed with anti-actin antibody to verify equal\nloading   B  HEK293 cells in 24-well plates were transiently transfected\nwith

signaling  and is critical for cancer cell proliferation\n\n[33 34]  To determine the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on\n\nWnt/b-catenin signaling in human cancer cells  we examined\naxin2 and cyclin D1 expression in human prostate PC-3 and\n\nDU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells  As\n\nshown in Figure 3  niclosamide significantly suppressed axin2 and\n\ncyclin D1 expression in all four cancer cell lines \n\nTo determine if the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on Wnt/b-\ncatenin signaling is related to LRP6 expression  we examined\n\nLRP6 expression and phosphorylation after niclosamide treat-\n\nment  As shown in Figure 3A  niclosamide was able to suppress\n\nLRP6 expression and phosphorylation in all four cancer cell lines \n\nindicating that niclosamide can repress Wnt/b-catenin signaling in\nbreast and prostate cancer cells by suppressing LRP6 expression \n\nNiclosamide Induces LRP6 Degradation\nTo define the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of\n\nniclosamide on LRP6 protein level  we studied LRP6 turnover \n\nPC-3 cells were treated with niclosamide at 1 2 mM for 0  3  6  10\nand 24 h in the presence of cycloheximide  a protein synthesis\n\ninhibitor  As shown in Figure 4  in the absence of niclosamide\n\ntreatment  LRP6 was degraded with a half-life of about 6 9 h \n\nTreatment with niclosamide significantly enhanced LRP6 turn-\n\nover with a half-life of about 2 3 h  Figure 4A  This shortening of\n\nLRP6 half-life suggests that niclosamide can stimulate LRP6\n\ndegradation  To test whether niclosamide regulates LRP6\n\nexpression at the transcription level too  we examined LRP6\n\nmRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR  As shown in Figure 4B \n\nLRP6 mRNA levels were not significantly changed after\n\nniclosamide treatment in PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells  There-\n\nfore  niclosamide-induced LRP6 suppression is mainly due to the\n\nenhanced LRP6 degradation \n\nNiclosamide Has No Effect on Dishevelled-2  Dvl2 \nExpression in Prostate and Breast Cancer Cells\nIt has been reported that niclosamide downregulates compo-\n\nnents of the Wnt pathway  specifically cytosolic Dvl2 expression \n\nresulting in diminished downstream Wnt/b-catenin signaling in\ncolorectal cancers [23]  To test whether Dvl2 is also involved in\n\nniclosamide-induced Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibition in pros-\ntate and breast cancer cells  we examined both total cellular and\n\ncytosolic levels of Dvl2 expression  Unexpectedly  we found that\n\nniclosamide had no effect on both total cellular and cytosolic Dvl2\n\nexpression in human prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-\n\nMB-231 and T-47D cancer cells  Figure 3  while LRP6 expression\n\nwas greatly suppressed at the same treatment  Figure 3A  These\n\nresults indicate that LRP6 downregulation is the key mechanism\n\nunderlying niclosamide-induced Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibi-\ntion in human prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-\n\n231 and T-47D cancer cells \n\nNiclosamide Induces Prostate and Breast Cancer Cell\nApoptosis and Inhibits Cancer Cell Proliferation\nThe Wnt/b-catenin pathway is important for cancer cell\n\napoptosis [35 36]  Having established that niclosamide is a potent\n\ninhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in prostate and breast cancer\ncells  we then tested whether niclosamide is able to induce\n\napoptosis  As shown in Figure 5A  exposure to niclosamide at 1 2\n\nand 2 4 mM for 24 h significantly induced apoptotic DNA\nfragmentation in prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-\n\nMB-231 and T-47D cancer cells \n\nGiven that niclosamide can block Wnt/b-catenin signaling in\ncancer cells and can induce apoptosis  we next examined the effect\n\nof niclosamide on cancer cell proliferation  As shown in Figure 5B \n\nniclosamide inhibited cancer cell proliferation with IC50 values less\n\nthan 1 mM for all four tested cell lines  The IC50 values are\ncomparable to those shown to suppress the activities of Wnt/b-\ncatenin signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells \n\nDiscussion\n\nCompelling evidence indicates that there is an abnormal up-\n\nregulation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in tumorigenesis of\nmany types of cancer  While genetic mutations of certain\n\ncomponents of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway  such as APC and\nCTNNB1  are significant contributing factors for colorectal\n\ncancers  they are typically not the predominate mechanism\n\nassociated with many other types of cancer such as breast and\n\nprostate cancers  Instead  it appears that dysregulation of Wnt/b-\ncatenin signaling on the cell surface leads to aberrant activation of\n\nthis pathway in these types of cancer [3–5 37]  Therefore  targeted\n\ninhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling at the cell surface is a\nrational and promising new approach for the cancer therapy \n\nFigure 2  Effects of niclosamide on Wnt/b-catenin signaling in\ncancer cells   A

 and HER2-negative breast cancer  is one\n\nof the most difficult subtypes of breast cancer to treat due to a lack\n\nof a targeted therapy  Studies have demonstrated that Wnt/b-\ncatenin signaling activation is preferentially found in TNBC and is\n\nassociated with a poor clinical outcome [38]  Basal-like breast\n\ncancer  BLBC  shares many overlapping features with BLBC \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that LRP6 is up-regulated in\n\nhuman TNBC or BLBC [14–16]  In mice  mammary gland\n\ndevelopment and MMTV-Wnt1-induced mammary tumorigene-\n\nsis were delayed in LRP6+/- mice [14]  while MMTV-LRP6\n\ntransgenic mice developed hyperplasia in their mammary glands\n\ndue to LRP6-mediated Wnt/b-catenin signaling [39]  Transcrip-\ntional knockdown of LRP6 in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells\n\nsignificantly decreased Wnt/b-catenin signaling  cell proliferation \nand tumor growth in vivo [15]  In addition  it has been\ndemonstrated that specific LRP6 antibodies were able to block\n\nMMTV-Wnt1 or MMTV-Wnt3 xenografts in vivo [17 18]  and\nthat recombinant Mesd protein  an LRP6 antagonist  markedly\n\nsuppressed tumor growth in MMTV-Wnt1 xenograft models [15] \n\nMoreover  salinomycin  a breast cancer stem cell killer [40]  was\n\nrecently demonstrated to be an inhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin\nsignaling by inducing LRP6 degradation [41]  In the present\n\nstudy  we demonstrated that niclosamide suppressed LRP6\n\nexpression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and ER-positive breast\n\ncancer T-47D cells  and inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation\n\nwith IC50 values less than 1 mM  Our results support the concept\nthat LRP6 is a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer\n\nincluding TNBC \n\nAccumulated evidence has demonstrated a significant role for\n\nWnt/b-catenin signaling in the development and progression of\nhuman prostate cancer [3]  Although it is unclear whether LRP6 is\n\nup-regulated in prostate cancer  we have recently demonstrated\n\nthat the LRP6 antagonist Mesd markedly inhibited Wnt/b-catenin\nsignaling in prostate cancer PC-3 cells  and suppressed PC-3 cell\n\nproliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo [42 43]  In the\npresent study  we found niclosamide inhibited the proliferation of\n\nprostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells with IC50 values less than\n\n1 mM  which are comparable to those shown to suppress LRP6\nexpression and the activities of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in\nprostate cancer cells  Together  these findings suggest that LRP6\n\nis a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer \n\nMutations in APC and CTNNB1 are two major factors for Wnt/\nb-catenin signaling activation in colorectal cancers  however\nrecent studies indicate that the levels of Wnt/b-catenin signaling\nin colorectal cancer cells could be modulated on the cell surface\n\n[44–48]  In particular  Ueno et al  demonstrated that Wnt receptor\nfrizzled-7 activates the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in colorectal\ncancer cells despite the presence of APC or CTNNB1 mutation\nand that frizzled-7-siRNA may be used as a therapeutic reagent\n\nfor colorectal cancer [48]  Shi et al  reported that siRNA

cancer cells containing downstream\n\nmutations [47]  The secreted frizzled-related protein  SFRP \n\nfamily and Wnt inhibitory factor-1  WIF-1  are secreted Wnt/b-\ncatenin signaling antagonists that bind to Wnt ligands  and\n\ninterfere with Wnt-receptor interaction  It has been reported that\n\nloss of SFRP family expression was associated with promoter\n\nhypermethylation in colorectal cancer [44]  and that restoration\n\nof SFRP function in colorectal cancer cells attenuates Wnt/b-\ncatenin signaling even in the presence of downstream mutations\n\n[45]  Similarly  He et al  reported that loss of WIF-1 expression\n\nwas associated with promoter hypermethylation in colorectal\n\ncancer  and that restoration of WIF-1 function  Wnt-1 siRNA  or\n\na monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody induces

demonstrate herein that\n\nniclosamide is a potent Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibitor by\ninducing LRP6 degradation in cancer cells  and displays an\n\nexcellent anticancer activity in vitro  Therefore  as a FDA\n\napproved antihelminthic drug  niclosamide will be an interesting\n\ncomoound to be optimized to increase its bioavailability and to be\n\ntested for its in vivo cancer preventive and

epithelium and stroma are fundamental to normal tissue homeostasis and for tumor initiation\nand progression  Gene expression studies of in vitro coculture models demonstrate that in vitro models have relevance for tumor\nprogression in vivo  For example  stromal gene expression has been shown to vary in association with tumor subtype in vivo \nand analogous in vitro cocultures recapitulate subtype-specific biological interactions  Cocultures can be used to study cancer\ncell interactions with specific stromal components  e g  immune cells  fibroblasts  endothelium  and diﬀerent representative cell\nlines  e g  cancer-associated versus normal-associated fibroblasts versus established  immortalized fibroblasts  can help elucidate\nthe role of stromal variation in tumor phenotypes  Gene expression data can also be combined with cell-based assays to identify\ncellular phenotypes associated with gene expression changes  Coculture systems are manipulable systems that can yield important\ninsights about cell-cell interactions and the cellular phenotypes that occur as tumor and stroma co-evolve \n\n1  The Tumor Microenvironment \nThe Value of Studying Heterotypic\nInteractions in Cancer Biology\n\nWhile mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors cause\nneoplastic epithelial cells to lose many of their growth con-\nstraints  neoplastic cells do not lose their interactions with\nthe surrounding nonmalignant cells or with the extracellular\narchitecture [1]  Instead  the interactions with cells in themi-\ncroenvironment change during cancer progression and can\npromote or repress the tumorigenic process [2  3]  Growth\nfactors  cytokines  and proteolytic enzymes are upregulated\nand secreted [4  5]  giving a histological appearance of\ngranulation tissue similar to tissue morphology during phys-\niological wound-healing processes  The observation of histo-\nlogical changes in tumor adjacent tissue led Dvorak to pro-\npose that tumors are “wounds that do not heal” [6]  More\n\nrecent experimental and observational studies have expand-\ned on these observations to further suggest that an activated\nstroma may be dominant in cancer progression \n\nSome key evidence for the dominance of stroma comes\nfrom work identifying windows of susceptibility for breast\ncancer initiation and progression  e g  during pregnancy\nand postlactational involution  Extracellular matrix  ECM \nfunction and composition are remodeled during pregnancy\nand lactation [7]  and these changes along with other\nchanges in tissue cellular composition appear to contribute\nto increased breast cancer progression [8]  Conversely  pro-\ngression can be reversed by stromal changes  Tamoxifen  a\ndrug that primarily targets ER-positive epithelium  induces\nchanges inmammary stroma leading to suppression of trans-\nformed phenotypes [9]  and premalignant breast cancer\ncells placed on a reconstituted physiological basement mem-\nbrane undergo cell growth arrest and form polarized alveolar\n\n\n\n\n2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology\n\nstructures as normal epithelial cells would [10]  These obser-\nvations illustrate the important role of stromal response in\nbreast cancer \n\nIn recent years  tissue-level wound and stromal responses\nhave been more thoroughly characterized using molecular\ndata [11  12]  A growing body of gene microarray data\nsupport a role for stromal gene expression in breast cancer\nprogression  Table 1  Finak et al  analyzed biopsies of can-\ncer tissue and nonaﬀected tissue from breast cancer patients \nBy laser capture microdissection  they separated the tumor\ncompartment from the stromal compartment and per-\nformed microarrays to identify a prognostic gene set from\ntumor stroma that predicted patient survival [13]  Ma et al \ncompared gene expression of ductal carcinoma in situ\n DCIS -associated stroma to stroma from individuals with\ninvasive disease and showed that the majority of stromal\nalterations occur at the DCIS stage [14]  These authors\nargued that invasiveness is dependent on the signals the epi-\nthelial cells receive from myoepithelial cells  fibroblasts  and\nmyofibroblasts  Allinen et al  isolated pure stromal cell pop-\nulations from reduction mammoplasties  DCIS  and invasive\nbreast cancer patients  Analysis of gene expression of these\npurified cell populations revealed widespread molecular\nchanges in all cell types of the breast cancer stroma [15]  We\nand others have shown an activated wound response in the\ntumor microenvironment of breast cancer [11  16] \n\nSignatures of wound response from in vitro [16] or in\nvivo [11  12] predict breast cancer survival and relapse in\nindependent datasets  Finally  Beck et al  have studied both\nmacrophage infiltration-associated gene expression [17] and\nfibromatosis-associated gene expression [18] as predictors\nof outcome  These studies cumulatively suggest that tumor\nprogression occurs due to the concerted action of a variety of\nstromal responses \n\nThe stromal responses to a tumor can be collectively re-\nferred to as “the tumor microenvironment ” It includes all\nthe structures and cells that support the tumor  extracellular\nmatrix  blood vasculature  inflammatory cells  adipocytes \nmyoepithelial cell s and fibroblasts  all of which have been\nshown to contribute to cancer development [19]  However \nit is important to distinguish two types of microenvironment\nbased on location  intratumoral microenvironment and ex-\ntratumoral microenvironment  Figure 1 shows a schematic\ndepicting the wide variety of cells that make up intra\nand extratumoral microenvironments  The intratumoral mi-\ncroenvironment is what has classically been referred to as\n“microenvironment of the tumor” or “tumor stroma ” It is\nphysically located within the tumor mass or very directly\nadjacent [20]  The majority of in vivo studies of microenvi-\nronment have emphasized this intratumoral microenviron-\nment as shown in Table 1  However  some studies have also\nexamined the extratumoral microenvironment  which extends\nfurther around the perimeter of the tumor  frommillimeters\nto centimeters  depending on the study  and includes all the\nhistologically benign tissue that surrounds the tumor  This\nextratumoral tissue also provides support for and influences\ntumor progression  reflecting either a tissue level response\nto the tumor or the baseline biological behavior of the\ntissue in which the tumor developed [21]  Both intratumoral\n\nand extratumoral microenvironments are related to the\nconcept of “field cancerization ” initially defined as changes\nto the epithelium which are found in histologically normal\ntissue near the site of tumorigenesis and that could account\nfor local recurrences [22]  In recent years  the concept of\nfield cancerization has been broadened to include stromal\nchanges  A review of epithelial-specific field eﬀects has been\npresented elsewhere [23]  but  in the current review  we are\nfocusing on intratumoral and extratumoral stromal changes \n\nStudies of intratumoral and extratumoral stroma in pa-\ntient specimens have identified interesting biological associ-\nations  but it is diﬃcult to evaluate the specific contributions\nof distinct cellular populations in these complex tissues \nWiseman and Werb [5] concluded a review article in 2002\nwith an important idea  “if our aim is to find cures for dis-\neases that rely on epithelial and stromal crosstalk we must\nincrease our understanding of how these diﬀerent cell types\ncommunicate with each other ” In vitro cell-cell communi-\ncation studies can be integrated with studies from human\ntissue and with animal studies to better understand how het-\nerotypic communication alters disease  The purpose of this\nreview is to summarize some earlier work on cancer-stromal\ncocultures  focusing on human breast cancer and especially\non studies that evaluated gene expression using whole\ngenome approaches  We will then briefly review mouse gene\nexpression studies focused on the microenvironment and\ndiscuss how coculture data and mouse model systems can\ntranslate to insights on in vivo human microenvironments \n\n2  In Vitro Cocultures as Models to\nStudy the Microenvironment\n\nMonoculture studies of breast cancer cells have been the\nfoundation for much of what we understand about molec-\nular mechanisms and molecular signaling in cancer  Early\nstudies showed that basal-like and luminal breast cancers\nhad distinct responses to chemotherapeutics [24]  and more\nrecent studies have comprehensively profiled many estab-\nlished breast cancer cell lines to identify genomic models for\neach breast cancer subtype [25]  Pathway focused studies in\nmonocultures are also common  For example  Hoadley et al \nshowed that basal-like breast cancer cell lines are more\nsensitive to the combination of carboplatin and cetuximab\nin vitro when compared to luminal cancer cell lines  and that\nEGFR-signatures have prognostic value when projected onto\ntumor datasets [26]  Other studies have identified p53-\nloss or p53-mutation associated signatures that can predict\nmutation status and survival in vivo [27  28]  Studies of\nindividual cell lines in monoculture have contributed to the\ndevelopment of new targeted therapies and are proving to\nhave relevance in vivo  However  gene expression studies of\nmonoculture experiments are not informative formicroenvi-\nronment influences on progression  Coculture systems have\nbecome important in studying stromal factors \n\nDrastic changes occur when coculturing epithelium with\ndiﬀerent cell types  As a clear example  uterine epithelial cells\nproliferate in response to estrogen only when cocultured with\nstromal cells  but not when they are in a monoculture [30] \n\n\n\nJournal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology

culture surface [34]  In both 2D\nand 3D cultures  there are a number of variables that play a\nrole in determining what phenotypes are observed  including\nthe ratios of diﬀerent cell types  using a convenient prespec-\nified ratio such as 1   1 versus identifying multiple diﬀerent\nbiologically relevant ratios  [35]  the number of cell types\n e g  choosing to coculture epithelial cells only

or\nthe degree of cell contact  growing cells in direct physical\ncontact or separating cell types on transwell cultures \n\nIn addition to these variables that can be explicitly con-\ntrolled  there are some experimental variables that are less\n\neasily manipulated but important to consider in designing a\nstudy  For example  every cell line is unique and shows indi-\nvidual characteristics  To make experiments generalizable  it\nmay be necessary to use multiple cell lines  at least 3 or more \nto establish reproducible trends for a given cell type  e g \nthree cell lines or more may show consistency in luminal\nbreast cancer behaviors  whereas one cell line alone cannot\nestablish behavior of the class of luminal cell lines  Also \nchanges in the stromal cells over time should be

Biotechnology\n\nconsidered when interpreting results  If a primary cell line\nwill be used  variation in patient characteristics should be\nconsidered  i e  due to collection of cells from diﬀerent\npatients with diﬀerent tumor subtypes  ages  and genetic\nor environmental exposure history  It is known that cell\nlines can persistently harbor changes due to the exposure\nhistory of their donors [44]  Some studies have used hTERT\nimmortalized cells to create a renewable source of isogenic\ncell lines for coculture studies [35  45]  and this has some\nadvantages for reproducibility  On the other hand  variation\nmay be of interest itself  such as variation that suggest dif-\nferences between African-American and Caucasian fibroblast\nlines [46]  Aligning the strengths and weaknesses of a given\nmodel system with the research question is more important\nthan perfectly recapitulating the complexities of the tissue \n\n2 1  Cellular Phenotypes of Epithelial Cells in Coculture  Chan-\nges in Gene Expression  Epithelial gene expression has been\nexamined in relation to exposure to diﬀerent cell types such\nas fibroblasts  immune cells  and even adipocytes  Table 2 \nFibroblasts are abundant in the extratumoral and intratu-\nmoral microenvironment and play an essential role in the\nmaintenance of normal tissue  The activation of fibroblasts\nto myofibroblasts creates a sustained fibrosis and wound-\nhealing response leading to the desmoplastic reaction in ad-\nvanced breast carcinomas [21  47]  Fibroblasts also deposit\nthe ECM necessary for cells to adhere  and their activation\nchanges ECM and signaling to alter tumor initiation and\nprogression [19] \n\nRozenchan et al  exposed MCF10A  a benign mammary\nepithelial cell line and the transformed MDA-MB-231 cell\nline to cancer-associated fibroblasts  CAFs  and normal\ntissue-associated fibroblasts  NAFs  from the same patient \nThrough this indirect coculture  they found many changes in\nthe gene expression  MDA-MB-231 cells upregulated genes\ninvolved in the β-catenin/TCF pathway probably related to\nregulating cell polarity  DDX21 and DICER  while MCF10A\ncells induced stress response  S100A9  HSP90B1  and\nSPRR3  prosurvival genes when cultured with CAFs  Mean-\nwhile  in culture with NAFs  MDA-MB-231 responded by\ndownregulating genes associated with glycolipid and fatty\nacid biosynthesis  ACSL5 and AGTPAT4  potentially aﬀect-\ning membrane biogenesis  and MCF10A downregulated\ngenes critical for growth control and adhesion  DDIT4 \nCTNND1  and PCDH1  [37]  The influence of the fibroblast\non breast cancer cell gene expression has also been observed\nin cocultures comparing fibroblasts from negative and pos-\nitive lymph nodes [38] and in comparing fibroblasts from\ndiﬀerent anatomical sites and patients [42]  Each of these\nstudies showed that fibroblasts from diﬀerent sites and pa-\ntients had distinct eﬀects on the cancer cells with which they\nwere cultured in both cell based assays and gene expression \nThe fibroblasts from diﬀerent anatomical sites  skin and\nlung  induce distinct proliferation eﬀects on breast cancer\ncell lines  These eﬀects can be used to segregate these cell\nlines on the basis of their tissue of origin [42]  The tran-\nscriptional changes induced in breast cancer cell lines when\ncocultured with fibroblasts from positive and negative lymph\n\nnodes had some common features  However  the fibroblast\nresponses were distinct for each breast cancer cell line  sug-\ngesting a stromal response intrinsic to breast cancer subtype\n[38]  Likewise  in a diﬀerent model system  soluble inter-\nactions between basal and luminal cancer cells had distinct\neﬀects on fibroblast gene expression  When in a transwell\ncoculture system  basal-like breast cancer cells induced the\nupregulation of genes such as IL-6  IL-8  CXCL3  TWIST \nand SOD2 in fibroblasts  while luminal breast cancers did\nnot [35]  These studies echo one another in demonstrating\nthat both the fibroblasts and the cancer cells influence the\ncharacter of the interaction \n\nThe studies discussed above were conducted using tran-\nswells where cells were not in direct contact  but several gene\nexpression studies have incorporated direct cell-cell contact\nwith some additional technical or analytical steps  Direct\ncell-cell contact can create gene expression profiles that are\ndistinct from those produced through soluble factors alone \nHowever  methods for separating the cells may aid interpre-\ntation of the resulting gene expression profiles  For example \ncells can be transfected with a GFP reporter and grown in\ncoculture with fibroblasts  The GFP-producing cells can then\nbe isolated using flow cytometry and subsequently analyzed\n[48]  Similarly  magnetic beads have been used to separate\ncells and demonstrate that tumor fibroblasts support neo-\nplastic progression by altering the epigenome of mammary\nepithelial cells [49]  specifically increasing hypermethylation\nof the CST6 gene  The authors of that study speculated that\nthe direct cell-to-cell contact is involved in the epigenetic cas-\ncade that produces long-term silencing of this gene  Others\nhave performed a variety of cell-sorting methods  ranging\nfrom the use of surface markers to labeling of cells with\nshort-lived cell tracking dyes [35]  These cell sortingmethods\nare proving to be an important tool for deconvoluting coc-\nultures \n\nCocultures can also be deconvoluted using computation-\nal methods rather than physical cell sorting  Buess et al  de-\nscribed a deconvolution method that computationally con-\ntrols for cellular composition of cocultures  Using this ap-\nproach  it was demonstrated that the interaction between\nsome breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts induces an\ninterferon-response signature which is correlated with sur-\nvival [39]  Using the same deconvolution method  Camp\net al  [35] have recently showen that luminal and basal-like\nbreast cancer cells respond diﬀerently to the coculture with\nfibroblasts  but both show substantially altered expression\nrelative to the monocultures  Furthermore  the direct cocul-\nture of basal-like breast cancer cells and fibroblasts induced\nthe expression of interleukins and chemokines such as IL-6 \nIL-8  CXCL3  TGF-β also TWIST  and SOD1  while luminal\nbreast cancer cell line cocultures with fibroblasts upregulated\ngenes involved in stress response such as the S100AB  S100A9\ngenes as well as certain transcription factors  FOXP1 and\nFOXA2  These cocultures studies raised the hypothesis that\nheterotypic interactions are intrinsic to breast cancer sub-\ntypes  and better understanding of cell-cell interactions will\nyield important insights relative to treating and clinical\ncourse of these cancer subtypes \n\n\n\nJournal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 7\n\nOther stromal cell types  beyond fibroblasts  have been\nless well studied but certainly play a critical role in tumor\nmicroenvironment  The most widely studied are endothelial \ninflammatory  and mesenchymal stem cells  For example \nBuess et al  have documented that endothelial cells cocul-\ntured with epithelial cells induce M-phase genes in the\nCD44+/CD24− epithelial cell population  This “M-phase\ncell cycle gene set” consists of 70 genes such as HMGN2 \nCDC2  CDKN3  DICER  and so forth and can predict metas-\ntasis in vivo  But perhaps more importantly  endothelial coc-\nultures mirrored results with fibroblasts  gene expression\nstudies showed complex patterns reflecting substantial vari-\nation in the abilities of normal and malignant cells to send\nand respond to extrinsic signals [40] \n\nMacrophages have been evaluated for their role in tumor\nprogression using coculture models  For example  Hage-\nmann et al  showed that coculture with macrophages in-\ncreased tumor cell invasiveness through TNF-α dependant\nupregulation of matrix metalloproteinases  MMP-2 -3 -7 -9 \n[50]  Hou et al  have recently demonstrated that macropha-\nges induce COX-2 expression in breast cancer cells through\nIL-1β signaling [51]  These observations gain greater import-\nance when they are designed to confirm in vivo  biology  such\nas work following on recent studies [52] showing that tumor-\nassociated macrophages may enhance metastasis through\nthe activation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling\nin neoplastic mammary epithelial cells  Continued work in\ncocultures with macrophages can elucidate whether these\nmacrophage-cancer cell associations are subtype specific  as\nmany of the markers induced in cancer cells  e g  EGFR and\nCOX2  are strongly associated with breast cancer subtype \n\nA common theme across stromal cell-breast cancer coc-\nultures has been an increase in cytokines and inflammatory\ncells  These results have been observed for a variety of mes-\nenchymal cell types  therefore  it may not be surprising that\nsimilar responses have been observed in cocultures withmes-\nenchymal stem cells  MSCs  MSCs are important players\nin the tumor microenvironment [1]  as they migrate and\nengraft into the primary tumor site  This was compellingly\ndemonstrated in a humanized mouse model  tibial injec-\ntions of human MSCs induced increased proliferation and\nprogression of tumor xenografts [41]  These results also\ndemonstrate that species diﬀerences are important because\nthe mouse mesenchymal cells in the control animals  no\ntibial injection  were not capable of promoting progression\nas strongly  Complementary in vitro cocultures used in this\nstudy clearly demonstrated a role of CXCL7 and IL-6 sig-\nnaling in the aggressive  invasive phenotypes induced by\nMSCs  Other recent results also have supported the role of\nMSCs in promoting a more aggressive phenotype  showing\nthat  after direct coculture of MDA-MB-231  T47D  and SK-\nBr3 with MSCs  the cancer cells upregulate genes such as\nSNAIL  TWIST  vimentin  N-cadherin  and so forth  [53] \nSimilar observations were detected in transwell assays with\nSUM149 andHMEC cells [54]  suggesting that many of these\nsignals may be communicated via soluble factors  potentially\nincluding those factors identified by Liu et al  [41] \n\nAn emerging area that will require additional investi-\ngation is how microRNAs modify the stromal-epithelial gene\n\nexpression patterns  In a recent study  neoplastic epithelial\ncells have been directly cocultured with bone marrow stro-\nmal cells  and microRNAs were shown to be transported via\ngap junctions between cancer cells andMSCs  These microR-\nNAs led to reduced CXCL12 expression and a decreased\nproliferation [55]  Thus  future studies of gene expression\nchanges in cocultured cells may find that microRNAs play\nan important role in controlling some of the observed gene\nexpression profiles  The direct cell-cell transport of a critical\nmRNA regulators suggests that the complexity of cell-cell\ninteractions far exceeds what we have begun to understand \nHowever  a growing database of gene expression data from\ncoculture studies will help to advance our understanding of\nthe unique cell-cell interactions that influence cancer pro-\ngression \n\nWhile in vitro cocultures allow controlled investigation of\nsignaling pathways and help to reconstruct step by step the\ncomplexity of cancer biology  human tumors in vivo are the\nultimate system of interest  Thus  most studies have tested\ntheir signatures in coculture by linking the gene expression\npatterns with published microarray findings in patients  For\nexample  the aforementioned “M-phase cell cycle gene set ”\nobtained through the coculture of endothelial cells with the\nstem cell portion of cancer cell lines  was projected onto\ntumor data to demonstrate that this gene set can predict\nmetastasis in vivo and patient survival [40]  Luciani et al  also\nused their in vitro signature of seven independent primary\ntumor cell line cocultures with primary fibroblasts to define\ntwo groups of patients with distinct overall survival rates\n[29]  Other approaches include showing that coculture-de-\nrived signatures recapitulate established gene expression\nclasses  For example  a subtype-specific fibroblast-coculture\nsignature predicts breast cancer subtype in tumors  demon-\nstrating that the in vitro signature is relevant in vivo [35] \nThese in vivo comparisons can also be combined with exper-\nimental data that demonstrate function  either in cell-based\nassays in vitro or in mouse models \n\nA next step with important in vivo implications is ex-\ntension of cocultures to study responsiveness to cytotoxic\nchemotherapeutics  If signatures associated with increased\ntoxicity were able to predict pathologic response in vivo \ncocultures could help identify pathways that are promising\nas biomarkers or targets in neoadjuvant therapies  Given\nthe wealth of public data from tumors and their adjacent\nmicroenvironment that has accrued in recent decades  it is\nbecoming increasingly possible to test the relevance of in\nvitro gene expression results in patient populations at little\nadditional cost  These types of analyses could help define\ncandidate pathways involved in interactions to those that are\nmost likely to play an important role in disease progression \n\n2 2  Confirming Changes in Cellular Phenotypes  Using Cell-\nBased Assays to Corroborate Gene Expression Data with Coc-\nultures  Because much of the research on cocultures has fo-\ncused on how the stroma modulates invasive potential  cell-\nbased assays demonstrating changes in migration and an-\nchorage-independent growth can help to establish biologic\nplausibility  Epithelial cells  in normal physiological condi-\ntions  are immobile  attached to a basement membrane  and\n\n\n\n8 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology\n\nbound to neighboring cells through several types of cell-\njunctions  They present apical versus basal polarity- and\nthese characteristics are essential for them to carry out their\nfunction in vivo [56]  One of the most drastic and visible\nchanges that epithelial cells can acquire during carcinogen-\nesis is the capacity to migrate  a hallmark of cancer [47] \nThus  migration assays in vitro can help assess how gene\nexpression changes alter the capacity to migrate and invade \nCommon migration assays are transwell/Boyden chamber\nassays and scratch/wound-healing assay  The Boyden chamber\nassay allows for paracrine and autocrine communication\nbecause it uses a transwell coculture system in which the cells\nshare the same medium but cannot physically interact  The\nchemotactic cells are placed on the bottom well  and the mi-\ngrating cells are placed on the top insert  This insert has\npores big enough  usually 8 0 μm  to allow cells to migrate\nthrough  The transwell migration assays may or may not\ninclude an extracellular matrix  ECM  layer  If this ECM\nlayer is present  the assay models the capacity of cells to break\ndown ECM and invade  whereas in the absence of ECM  the\nmigratory capacity alone is investigated  In either case  the\ncells migrating to the opposite side of the transwell insert are\nfixed  stained  and counted  The wound/scratch assay allows\nfor paracrine  autocrine  and cell-to-cell communication \nCells are seeded on the same surface in direct contact  a\nscratch is made when cells are nearly confluent  and cells\nmigrating into the scratch are measured overtime  By label-\ning one cell type with a fluorescent label  it is possible to\nidentify which of the two cell types are closing the wound \n\nMany of the stromal cocultures discussed above have\nbeen evaluated for their eﬀects on migration of cancer cells \nFor example  focusing on fibroblasts  Potter et al  showed\nthat tumor stromal cells  compared to normal stromal cells \ncaused greater chemotaxis of MDA-MB-231 and that this\neﬀect could be blocked by the addition of a monoclonal\nantibody to CCL2 [57]  MCF7s also become more migratory\nwhen cocultured with fibroblasts [58]  Fibroblast popula-\ntions isolated from diﬀerent distances relative to a breast tu-\nmor had distinct eﬀects on the migratory capacity of MCF7\ncells in scratch assays [59]  Similar findings have been ob-\nserved for MSCs [60] and macrophages [61]  Breast adipo-\ncytes are abundant  comprising a major percentage of the\nextratumoral microenvironment  and have also been cocul-\ntured with breast cancer cells  Adipocytes are challenging to\nculture and coculture because they terminally diﬀerentiate\nand cannot be propagated to achieve a reproducible cul-\nture system  however  they are proving to have important\nimplications for cancer progression  Dirat et al  showed that\nthe estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cell line ZR75 1 \nand the estrogen-receptor negative line SUM159PT  both\nincreased their invasive capacity after 72 hours in coculture\nwith mature primary adipocytes [62] \n\nAs an epithelial cell becomes more aggressive  it becomes\nless dependent on ECM and basement membrane interac-\ntions for survival  After coculture with certain types of cells \nbenign or malignant epithelial cells can acquire or enhance\ntheir anchorage-independent growth properties  There are\ntwo main types of assays to address anchorage independ-\nent growth  mammosphere  and soft-agar colony formation\n\nassays  In both cases  coculture studies can be designed to\nevaluate paracrine  autocrine  and/or cell-to-cell contacts \nIn the mammosphere formation assay  cells are cultured in\nsuspension in a defined growth media [62]  Colonies are al-\nlowed to grow for 7–10 days and then analyzed  Only cells\nwith anchorage-independent growth capacity will grow  so\nthe number and size of colonies reflect acquisition of this\nphenotype  In soft-agar colony formation assays  cells are\ngrown in a gel-like matrix that provides more structure than\na suspension culture  but the same phenotypes  colony num-\nber and size  are assessed after a period of growth  typically\nat least two weeks  These assays have been used to confirm\nanchorage-independent growth changes in coculture  For\nexample  breast cancer fibroblasts decreased time required\nfor MCF7s to form mammospheres and increased the\noverall number of spheres relative to cocultures with normal\nfibroblasts  Additionally  when MDA-MB-468  a basal-like\nbreast cancer cell line  was cocultured with CAFs  the number\nof soft-agar colonies were higher than when cocultured with\nNAFs [63]  MSCs have also been shown to induce mam-\nmosphere formation in human mammary epithelial cells\n HMECs  and SUM149 but not in primary inflammatory\nbreast cancer cells  MDA-IBC-3  These eﬀects occurred\nthough paracrine factors  as conditioned media from the\nMSCs had the same eﬀects [54] \n\nBy combining the expression data suggesting a certain\nphenotypic trait and with cell-based assays  new treatment-\nrelevant advances are possible  Genome expression data\nalong with cell-based assays can be used to test targeted per-\nturbations  e g  blocking cytokines or treating with growth\nfactors such as in [41]  to study how these phenotypes are\nregulated  Given that these studies can be done with human\ncells  and with careful control of cell ratio  cell physical en-\nvironment  polarity  and so forth  these systems can pro-\nvide interesting and important insights about how cancers\nbecome more invasive and aggressive through interactions\nwith their environments \n\n3  Mouse Models for Comparative Biology of\nTumor Microenvironment\n\nGiven identification of novel hypotheses from in vitro cocul-\ntures and confirmation of the cellular phenotypes in vitro  a\ncomplete picture of stromal-epithelial interactions requires\nlinkages with studies in vivo  As described above  public\ngenomic data can be useful for this purpose  but mouse\nmodels have contributed to our fundamental understanding\nof the reciprocal signaling between stroma and epithelial\ncompartments  Noe¨l et al  performed the first inoculation\nof cocultured fibroblasts and breast cancer cell lines with\nmatrigel in an athymic mice model  The inoculation of these\ncocultures decreased the latency time and enhanced tumor\ngrowth  Both tumor growth and latency time were depen-\ndent on the number of inoculated fibroblasts in the coculture\n[64]  In another classic example  it was demonstrated that\nwhen nontumorigenic cell lines are introduced into irradiat-\ned cleared fat pads  they form tumors  Conversely  when\nintroduced into cleared fat pads that have not been irradiated\n\n\n\nJournal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 9\n\nthe same tumorigenic cell lines do not form tumors  This\nindicates that radiation induces changes in the stromal mi-\ncroenvironment that contribute to neoplastic progression in\nvivo [65]  More recently  Hu et al  have shown that my-\noepithelial cells suppress  while fibroblasts enhance  tumor\nprogression from DCIS to invasive cancer in a mouse xen-\nograf model [66]  Novel models for combining and human-\nizing the microenvironment have also been proposed  in-\ncluding a humanized mouse xenograft model into cleared fat\npads [67]  and intraductal xenografts  where human cell lines\ncan be injected alone or with stromal components [68]  An\nadvantage of these models is that some of the innate immune\nresponses are preserved  as is the systemic circulation and the\nthree-dimensional structure of the tissue \n\nRecently  it has also been established that diﬀerent mouse\nmodels can be used to represent the heterogeneity of human\nbreast cancers [69]  For example  the C3Tag mice overexpress\nthe SV40Tag transgene in distal mammary ductal epithelium\nand terminal ductal lobular units  This overexpression allows\nfor a targeted inactivation of two tumor suppressor genes \np53 and Rb  giving rise to a very predictable onset of tumors\n[70]  They most commonly develop tumors with features of\nbasal-like breast cancer  Thus  these models may be useful\nfor studying basal-like microenvironments  Future studies\nshould examine howmicroenvironment characteristics  such\nas obesity or immune cell ablation  influence the progression\nof tumors in some of these model systems  to gain a per-\nspective on the role of microenvironment in diﬀerent breast\ncancer subtypes  These models  when combined with cocul-\nture-based mechanistic studies  can be a powerful combina-\ntion \n\n4  Limitations and Future Directions of\nthe Coculture Models of Gene Expression\n\nIn vitro cocultures have led to significant advances in our\nunderstanding of heterotypic interactions among diﬀerent\ncell types  complementing mouse studies and human in vivo\nstudies  They provide an easy and controllable technique\nto study heterotypic interactions among diﬀerent cell types \nBecause stromal interactions have been proven to be key\nin the carcinogenesis process  cocultures are important\ntools  However  making inferences about the relevance of\ncoculture findings to human patients in vivo requires some\nassumptions  An important limitation of cocultures is that\nthe unit of study is often a single pathway or a small num-\nber of pathways in isolation  and typically limited to cancer\ncells and one other stromal cell type  Each coculture system\nrecapitulates some aspect of the whole tissue and the inter-\nactions that are occurring in vivo  but given the complexity\nof the whole tissue  cocultures cannot fully recapitulate all\ndynamics and dimensions of the tissue  Assays and bioin-\nformatics methods are available for studying interactions\nbetween two or three cell types  but incorporating more cell\ntypes has not yet been accomplished  In any case  models\nwith increasing complexity will be needed to advance our\nunderstanding of heterotypic interactions in breast cancer \nStudies focusing on ECM in heterotypic contexts [71]  the\nrole of mechanical forces and the overall 3D architecture\n\nof the tissue [72] will add new biological insights  Some of\nthese factors can be addressed one by one in monoculture\nand coculture experiments  but it may be that the whole\ntissue is more than the sum of its parts  Consider for ex-\nample  a model that incorporates a variety of cell types but\ndoes not account properly for biophysical characteristics of\nthe tissue  Biomechanical features are of established impor-\ntance in cancer progression  and nanotechnology tools for\ndynamically altering physical environmentsmay help address\nthis [5  71]  However  our ability to design cocultures de-\npend on the knowledge we have about which factors matter \nLimitations of the cocultures  and areas where they fail to\nexplain in vivo phenomena will also potentially be inform-\native \n\nThere is still much to be learned about tumor-stroma\ninteractions and cocultures will play an essential role in fur-\nther understanding key processes in carcinogenesis  Future\nstudies using these coculture system should address several\nissues  including how the microenvironment of a tumor\nresponds to hypoxic conditions and how this aﬀects disease\nprogression  It is established that hypoxia occurs during tu-\nmor progression but the stromal-epithelial interactions af-\nfected by these conditions are unknown  These cocultures\nalso aﬀord the possibility of investigating controversial\nhypotheses  such as the Warburg eﬀect  which is not easily\nstudied in solid tumors  As metabolism has gained recogni-\ntion as an important driver of cancer progression [47]  novel\nmethods for studying metabolic microenvironments are\nneeded  Other studies should explore how cells of diﬀerent\norigins  epithelial versus mesenchymal  aﬀect tumor initia-\ntion and progression  While a variety of mesenchymal cells\nappear to induce similar responses in cancer cells  it remains\nunknown whether similar responses can also be induced by\ndediﬀerentiating epithelial cells  For example  the concept\nof epithelial-to mesenchymal transition  EMT  is gaining\nstrength in the cancer field  and if epithelial cells take on\nmore mesenchymal phenotypes  the influences on cancer\nprogression will be important to study  These transient phe-\nnotypes are challenging or impossible to study in vivo but\ncould be more readily manipulated in coculture systems \nFinally  while inflammatory responses and cytokine milieus\nemerge as important biological determinants of basal-like\nversus luminal cancer microenvironments  it will be inter-\nesting to investigate the eﬀect of diﬀerent inflammatory en-\nvironments on epithelial cells in the context of a coculture \nCancer cell responses to inflammatory signals have been\nstudied in monoculture  but adding other cells to the culture\nsystem will improve the in vivo relevance of these findings \n\n5  Conclusions\n\nThe tissue stroma is crucial for normal organ homeostasis\nas well as for tumor initiation and progression  Additionally \nboth intra- and extratumoral microenvironments play essen-\ntial roles in tumor biology  Thus  improved understanding of\nthe interactions that take place between epithelial cells and\nstromal compartments is critical to advancing our knowl-\nedge of human cancer  In vitro coculture systems are con-\ntrollable systems that can be used to study gene expression\n\n\n\n10 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology\n\nchanges and corresponding cellular phenotypes that occur as\ntumor and stroma co-evolve  These systems can be used to\ndefine critical factors mediating the communication between\nthe cell types  Although cocultures have limitations  the\ngrowing body of gene expression coculture data demon-\nstrates that these models are generating important insights\nin the biology of breast cancer \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully

from clinical trials with design features that limit external validity  The ability to\naccurately identify cardiotoxicity from administrative data would enhance safety information \n\nObjective—To characterize the performance of claims-based algorithms for identification of\ncardiac dysfunction in a cancer population \n\nResearch Design—We sampled 400 charts among 6 460 women diagnosed with incident breast\ncancer  tumor size ≥2 cm or node positivity  treated within 8 US health care systems during 1999–\n2007  We abstracted medical records for clinical diagnoses of heart failure  HF  and\ncardiomyopathy  CM  or evidence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction  We then assessed\nthe performance of 3 different ICD-9-based algorithms \n\nResults—The HF/CM coding algorithm designed a priori to balance performance characteristics\nprovided a sensitivity of 62%  95% confidence interval 40–80%  specificity of 99%  97–99% \npositive predictive value  PPV  of 69%  45–85%  and negative predictive value  NPV  of 98%\n 96–99%  When applied only to incident HF/CM  ICD-9 codes and gold standard diagnosis both\nappearing after breast cancer diagnosis  in patients exposed to anthracycline and/or trastuzumab\ntherapy the PPV was 42%  14–76% \nConclusions—Claims-based algorithms have moderate sensitivity and high specificity for\nidentifying HF/CM among patients with invasive breast cancer  Because the prevalence of HF/CM\namong the breast cancer population is low  ICD-9 codes have high NPV but only moderate PPV \nThese findings suggest a significant degree of misclassification due to HF/CM overcoding versus\nincomplete clinical documentation of HF/CM in the medical record \n\nKeywords\nbreast neoplasms  drug therapy  complications  cardiomyopathies  clinical coding\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCardiotoxicity is a known complication of certain systemic chemotherapies 1 Specifically \nthe development of cardiomyopathy  CM  with associated left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction  LVSD  and symptomatic heart failure  HF  are well documented adverse\neffects of anthracycline-based therapies and trastuzumab adjuvant therapy used to treat\nbreast cancer 2–4 However  estimates of risk have been derived from randomized controlled\ntrials  RCTs  with design features that may limit their external validity  Existing RCTs\nlargely excluded older patients and those with comorbidities  especially pre-existing\ncardiovascular conditions that may potentially be associated with higher rates of drug\ntoxicity  For example  of the 3 major trials of trastuzumab published in 2005 and 2006 that\nled to its widespread use  only 16% of women enrolled were 60 years or older5–7 compared\n\nAllen et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 May 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nto more than 50% in the overall U S  invasive breast cancer population and approximately\n40% of the HER2-positive population 8 Additionally  all 3 of these trastuzumab trials\nexcluded women with a history of HF  CM  coronary artery disease  uncontrolled\nhypertension  valvular disease  or unstable arrhythmias  More recent RCTs comparing the\nsafety and efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens in HER-2 positive breast cancer have\ncontinued to enroll a majority of patients  65 years of age  54% received\nanthracyclines and/or trastuzumab  and 28% of patients received no chemotherapy \nCompared to the chart-review eligible cohort  the 400 patients selected for detailed chart\nabstraction were older  had more comorbidity  had greater minority representation  had\nhigher stage of breast cancer  and were more likely to receive chemotherapy than the\noriginal population  see Table 1 \n\nDistribution of ICD-9 Codes for HF/CM Among Women with Breast Cancer\nA primary hospital discharge diagnosis of HF/CM was found in 1 5% of the total cohort  and\n10 8% of the oversampled chart abstraction cohort  Table 2  Outpatient ICD-9 codes for\nHF/CM occurred on ≥2 occasions in an additional 2 8% of the total cohort  and 18 0% of the\noversampled chart abstraction cohort  Other combinations of ICD-9 codes constituting HF/\nCM in algorithm #2 were rare  Any ICD-9 code was found in 41 5% of the chart sample \n\nThere was a more than 3-fold variation between sites in the frequency of ICD-9 codes for\nHF/CM among their breast cancer populations  data not shown  Among possible ICD-9\ncodes for HF/CM assigned to patients  the general code 428 0 “congestive heart failure \nunspecified” was the most frequently used at each of the 8 sites  Codes that specified the\nacuity and type of heart failure  e g  428 21 “acute systolic heart failure”  were used 10-fold\nless frequently than the general 428 0 designation  Codes for cardiomyopathy  425 4 and\n425 9  accounted for 2 9–9 0% of HF/CM ICD-9 codes at individual sites  Hypertensive\nheart disease with HF  402 and 404  codes accounted for less than 1% of HF/CM ICD-9\ncodes \n\nClinical and Imaging-Based Diagnosis of HF/CM Manually Abstracted from Charts\nDescription of HF/CM in the health record—Any mention of HF/CM  Appendix  was\nfound in 122 of the 400 abstracted patients  30 5%  with a median of 3 5 unique episodes of\ncare describing HF/CM per positively identified patient  On subsequent review by the study\ncardiologist  92 were determined to be “definite” HF/CM  6 “not” HF/CM  and 24\n“indeterminate” due to inadequate documentation to apply strict HF/CM criteria  grouped as\n“not” for the primary analysis \n\nCardiac imaging studies—Cardiac imaging studies with estimation of LVEF were\nfound among 259 women  64 8%  with 73 patients having only 1 study  51 patients with 2\nstudies  36 having 3 studies  and 99 having 4–13 studies  Echocardiographic modalities were\nmost common  Of the 400 sampled patients  52  13 0%  were found to have an LVEF\nrecorded quantitatively at <50% or qualitatively as mildly  moderately  or severely reduced \n14 of 52 women  26 9%  had documentation of reduced LVEF without a clinical diagnosis\nof HF/CM in the chart \n\nPerformance of Three ICD-9 Algorithms in the Breast Cancer Population\nThe sensitivity  specificity  PPV  and NPV are provided for the 3 different ICD-9-based\nclaims-based algorithms in Table 3  When assessed against the combined gold standard of\nchart abstracted clinical diagnosis and/or reduced LVEF  the balanced algorithm  #2  had a\nsensitivity of 62%  95% confidence interval [CI] of 40–80%  specificity of 99%  97–99% \nPPV of 69%  45–85%  and NPV of 98%  96–99%  Compared to the other algorithms  the\nbalanced #2 algorithm maximized sensitivity and PPV with relatively similar specificity and\n\nAllen et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 May 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nNPV  using only primary hospital discharge diagnosis ICD-9 codes for HF/CM resulted a\nsensitivity of only 14%  whereas using any ICD-9 HF/CM codes resulted in a PPV of only\n45%  In secondary analyses  when we included patients with an “indeterminate” chart\nabstracted clinical diagnosis of HF/CM as disease true positive  the performance of\nalgorithm #2 changed mildly  sensitivity 59%  40–76%  specificity 99%  97–100%  PPV\n82%  58–94%  and NPV 97%  95–99% \n\nAlgorithm Performance by Prevalent v  Incident and Exposed v  Unexposed\nThe sensitivity  specificity  PPV  and NPV for balanced algorithm #2 in relationship to\nprevalent and incident HF/CM are provided in Table 4  Mandating timing concordance\nbetween the appearances of claims-based and chart-abstracted HF/CM  i e  both having first\nappearance before the date of breast cancer diagnosis [prevalent]  or both having first\nappearance after the date of breast cancer diagnosis [incident]  had the expected effect of\nreduced sensitivity and PPV  though confidence intervals were wide due to decreased\nsample size  Specifically  of the 61 prevalent cases identified from medical record\nabstraction  12 were classified as incident cases via the administrative claims algorithm \n\nBased on existing knowledge of the relationship of chemotherapy with cardiotoxicity  the\nICD-9 algorithm performance characteristics of greatest research interest involve\nidentification of incident HF/CM among patients exposed to anthracyclines and/or\ntrastuzumab compared to the background rate of incident HF/CM  Algorithm performance\nfor identification of incident HF/CM among exposed patients trended towards a higher PPV\n Table 5  although due to smaller numbers of patients  the confidence intervals for\nperformance characteristics are wide \n\nSecondary analysis showed that among the 29 exposed patients identified by the\nadministrative claims algorithm as having incident HF/CM  Table 5  5 patients had their\nICD-9 code appear between cancer diagnosis and initiation of anthracycline / trastuzumab\ntherapy  among the 27 unexposed patients identified by the algorithm as having incident HF/\nCM  11 patients had their ICD-9 code appear within 70 days following cancer diagnosis \nSimilarly  among the 32 exposed patients identified by chart review as having incident HF/\nCM  1 patient had diagnostic information appear between cancer diagnosis and initiation of\nanthracycline / trastuzumab therapy  among the 14 unexposed patients identified by chart\nabstraction as having incident HF/CM  9 patients had their diagnostic information appear\nwithin 70 days following cancer diagnosis  Because of the even smaller number of incident\ncases identified under this delayed definition  algorithm performance characteristics for\nincident disease become unstable  95% CI for PPV 0–96 6% \n\nDISCUSSION\nAn algorithm of claims-based ICD-9 codes has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for\nHF/CM among women with incident invasive breast cancer  We found that the performance\nof an existing claims-based HF algorithm  modified here to include CM  ICD-9 codes 425 4\nand 425 9  was lower in this unique population of breast cancer patients  overall PPV 69%\n[Table 3]  incident-exposed PPV 42% [Table 5]  as compared to prior validation in a general\npopulation of adult patients  PPV 97% 11–13 These findings suggest a significant degree of\nmisclassification for this automated HF/CM algorithm among women with invasive breast\ncancer  which reflects HF/CM overcoding  algorithm false positives  versus incomplete\nclinical documentation of HF/CM in the medical record  true disease missed by gold\nstandard assessment \n\nBecause the primary application of such an algorithm is assumed to be population-based\nestimates cardiac events associated with these drugs during real-world use  PPVs in the 40–\n\nAllen et al  Page 7\n\nMed

an approach  If overcoding is more common among patients\nafter treatment with potentially cardiotoxic agents  significant overattribution from these\nobservational associations is likely  However  because increased screening for cardiac\ndisease is also likely to occur immediately after cancer diagnosis before initiation of\nchemotherapy  documentation of cardiac disease will then justify the avoidance of\npotentially cardiotoxic agents in such patients  Therefore  detection biases are likely to have\ncomplex implications for estimates of cardiotoxicity  Secondary analyses do suggest that\nnew documentation and coding for HF/CM are particularly likely to occur soon after breast\ncancer diagnoses in patients who ultimately do not go on to receive antracycline and/or\ntrastuzumab therapy  Unfortunately  because of limited power in subgroup analyses it is\nimpossible to provide precise estimates of the effect of these various biases \n\nAnthracycline and trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity is generally felt to manifest as\ncardiomyopathy documented as a decrease in the LVEF  Therefore  the cases of greatest\ninterest among the broader cohort would be HF with new reductions in LVEF following\nexposure to these chemotherapies  Because of 1  the absence of serial cardiac imaging\nstudies for the majority of patients  2  the inability to automatically extract quantitative\nmeasures of LVEF from cardiac imaging studies within most electronic health records  and\n3  the non-specific coding patterns for cardiac dysfunction  e g  428 0 “congestive heart\nfailure  unspecified” accounted for the majority of HF/CM codes  codes such as 428 21\n“acute systolic heart failure” were rare  we were forced to use an automated HF/CM\nalgorithm that was indifferent to measures of left ventricular systolic function  Electronic\ndatabases in their present form and in the setting of current cardiac surveillance patterns are\nunlikely to allow for automated algorithms that can accurately distinguish between various\ntypes of cardiac dysfunction \n\nAlgorithm decisions regarding trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity are often\nchallenging and depend on the clinical setting to which the algorithm is applied  We can\nimagine situations where high specificity  reducing false positives  would be paramount and\nother situations where high sensitivity  reducing false negatives  would be the primary goal \nTherefore  we investigated 3 different algorithms purposely designed to optimize different\nperformance characteristics  We found that the balanced algorithm performed as expected\n Table 3  providing comparatively good sensitivity and specificity  and therefore we\nemphasized it in the remainder of the subanalyses  However  future investigations may wish\nto use a highly sensitive or highly specific algorithm as circumstances dictate \n\nThe variability in ICD-9 code frequencies for HF/CM within the 8 health delivery systems\nraises questions regarding the consistency of algorithm performance between institutions \nThere was nearly a 4-fold institutional difference in the frequency of both prevalent and\nincident HF/CM coding  However  these coding differences may  in part  reflect differences\nin institutional patient populations  Coding frequencies were concordant with the average\nage of the population treated by the institution  data not shown  For example  the site with\nthe highest frequency of HF/CM codes treated a patient population of whom 51% were over\n65 years of age  compared to the site with the lowest frequency of HF/CM codes which\ntreated a patient population of whom only 22% were over 65 years of age  Different\ninstitutional culture for claims-based coding may provide an alternative explanation for at\nleast part of these HF/CM coding differences  If the large degree of site-based variability in\nICD-9 coding is not primarily a reflection of differences in case mix  e g  age  this raises\nthe concern that claims-based algorithms may have to be evaluated and interpreted\nindependently for institutions with obviously different ICD-9 HF/CM coding practices \n\nAllen et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 May 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

rigorous than prior studies which have\ninvolved physicians for the entire process of chart abstraction  Other studies evaluating\nmethods for identifying patients with HF have used a variety of standard definitions for HF \nincluding Framingham criteria 25 However  due to a lack of echocardiographic data on all\npatients and limitations in the naturalistic collection and recording of many of the criteria\nused for Framingham criteria  e g  decrease in vital capacity by one third from maximum \nnocturnal cough  S3 gallop  hepatojugular reflex  we chose to use provider assessments as\nrecorded in the chart combined with what LVEF data was available to determine the\npresence or absence of HF/CM  In addition  the chart review was not prospectively designed\nto make a determination of prevalent versus incident HF/CM in relation to chemotherapy\nexposure  the distinction between prevalent and incident disease was before or after the date\nof breast cancer diagnosis  respectively  Finally  the collection of data in routine care lacks\nthe standardization and detail that is inherent to the conduct of a clinical trial  Therefore  the\ngold standard presented here may have a greater degree of misclassification than seen in\nsome prior studies  particularly for incident diagnoses  Prevalent disease was based on\nascertainment within the 12 months prior to breast cancer diagnosis  it is conceivable that\nmore prevalent disease would have been identified had we looked further backwards in time \nWe only reviewed claims and chart data in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis  Most\nadjuvant chemotherapy is given in the first year  and trastuzumab cardiotoxicity is thought\nto happen relatively acutely  However  it is well known that anthracycline cardiotoxicity can\noccur years after exposure  We did not assess for cardiotoxicity that developed more than a\nyear after cancer diagnosis  and therefore coding algorithm performance is unknown for\nlate-onset cardiotoxicity  Finally  due to the delayed and non-granular nature of\nadministrative claims data  such an algorithm has limited utility in real-time identification of\nindividual cardiac events \n\nConclusion\nThe claims-based ICD-9 algorithms tested here had moderate PPVs for HF/CM  Therefore \nclaims-based algorithms in the setting of routine care  without the addition of some form of\nmedical record review or other data enhancement  are crude tools for accurately estimating\ncardiotoxicity among women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer  In the future  health\ncare forces which promote greater standardization of ICD-9 coding and greater use of serial\ncardiac imaging with storage of LVEF measures in a way that allows for automated\nextraction from the electronic health record would improve the performance of automated\nelectronic algorithms for characterizing cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy in community-based\npopulations

treatment has been shown in randomized trials to result\nin improved recurrence-free and overall survival  Preoperative systemic therapy  PST   also\nknown as neoadjuvant therapy or induction therapy  has been utilized for patients with\nlocally advanced breast cancer and phase II studies suggest improved outcomes with this\nstrategy  PST has also been explored for patients with early stage operable breast cancer\nbecause this approach may offer some potential benefits  including opportunity to evaluate\nprognostic and predictive biological markers and opportunity for faster evaluation of newer\nregimens since responses can be directly observed  Randomized controlled trials show\nequivalent outcomes with adjuvant therapy or PST with the same agents  but the latter\nincreases the likelihood of breast conserving surgery being possible 1–3 PST also appears to\nbe associated with better patient compliance than adjuvant therapy 4\n\nResponse to PST correlates with long-term outcomes  Pathologic complete remission  pCR \nis has been shown to be strongly associated with improved overall survival  and may serve\nas a suitable surrogate endpoint 3 5 There is intense interest in evaluating newer regimens\nthat can improve pCR rates  which may translate into better survival  Most of the regimens\ntested for PST have included an anthracycline and / or a taxane in combination or sequence\nbecause of their demonstrated activity in adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer  pCR rates of\n8 –28% have been reported depending on the agent  combination  dose and duration of\ntreatment 6–9 Taxanes are one of the most active agents in breast cancer  Objective response\nrate up to 50% have been described in phase III studies of docetaxel in treatment naïve\nMBC 10 Single agent carboplatin also has considerable activity in BC with RR of 25 –\n37% 11 12 Docetaxel and carboplatin have synergistic activity and largely non-overlapping\ntoxicities and the combination was shown to be highly active with overall RR of 60% as first\nline therapy for metastatic breast cancer  including in anthracycline pretreated patients 13\n\nIn addition to evaluating novel agents  there is also interest in exploring whether treatment\nschedule can impact the activity of agents in neoadjuvant setting  The Gompertzian kinetic\nmodel of tumor growth  in which the rate of tumor growth is not constant but decreases as\nthe tumor increases in size after cytoreductive therapy  would predict that decreasing the\nperiod available for re-growth by more frequent administration of chemotherapy in a dose-\ndense schedule would lead to improved response rate  The CALGB Intergroup trial C9741\ndemonstrated improved disease-free and overall survival in patients with axillary node\npositive breast cancer who received adjuvant therapy with AC → T  paclitaxel  or sequential\nsingle agent use of these agents in a dose-dense  every 2 week  schedule compared with the\nsame drugs administered every 3 weeks 14 Dose dense scheduling is now an established\npractice in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer  Whether a similar approach will have\nenhanced efficacy as PST is unknown but available data suggest that dose dense therapy is\nfeasible with tolerable toxicity 15 16\n\nBased on the demonstrated efficacy of docetaxel and carboplatin as single agents and in\ncombination as well as the potential of further improving their activity by dose-dense\nscheduling  we conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 4 cycles\nof docetaxel and carboplatin administered every 14 days with pegfilgrastim support in\npatients with stage II–III breast cancer  Here we report the efficacy and toxicity of this\nregimen  describe the surgical experience and highlight some areas for investigation in\nfuture PST trials \n\nRoy et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 December 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA

histologically or\ncytologically confirmed stage II or III  T2–4  N1–3  invasive breast cancer were eligible for\nthis multi institution trial coordinated by North Central Cancer Treatment Group  NCCTG \nOther key eligibility criteria included ECOG performance status of 0–1  adequate organ\nfunction  ANC >= 1500 cells/mL  HgB >= 10 0 g/dL  PLT >= 100 000 cells/mL  creatinine\nclearance >= 30 mL/min  total bilirubin  = grade 2  clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastases excluding\nisolated supraclavicular lymph node involvement  and pregnant or nursing women  The\nstudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board of all the participating institutions\nand all patients gave informed written consent prior to entry into the trial \n\nTreatment Schedule\nStudy treatment consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC of 6 IV on day 1 and\npegfilgrastim 6mg SQ on day 2  Cycles were repeated every 14 days for a total of 4 cycles\nunless there was progression at any time  Step wise dose reductions in docetaxel  60 mg/m2\nand 45 mg/m2  and carboplatin  AUC 4 5 and AUC 3 4  dose were allowed per protocol for\ntoxicity  Treatment was delayed up to a maximum of 21 days if toxicities had not resolved to\nless than grade 2 prior to the start of next cycle  All patients received dexamethasone\npremedication before docetaxel and antiemetic prophylaxis per their physicians’ discretion \nPatients proceeded to definitive surgery after resolution of toxicity but within 42 days after\nthe 4th cycle of chemotherapy  Any treatment  chemotherapy or radiation therapy after\ndefinitive surgery was not specified in the protocol and left to the discretion of treating\nphysician \n\nResponse and Toxicity Criteria\nPathologic complete response was defined as disappearance of all invasive and in situ tumor\nin the breast and axilla after chemotherapy  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who\nreceived at least one cycle of chemotherapy were considered evaluable for response  If a\npatient failed to proceed to surgery they were considered not to have achieved pCR  Clinical\nresponses were also measured by physical examination and were to be confirmed with the\nuse of mammography  ultrasound  and/or MRI  A clinical complete response  cCR  was\ndefined as the disappearance of all measurable and/or evaluable disease from the breast and\naxilla by physical exam \n\nStatistical Design and Analysis\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving pCR  The study used a two-\nstage Simon design to test that the pCR rate was at most 15% versus the alternative\nhypothesis that the true pCR rate was at least 30%  with a significance level of P=0 11 and\n91% power  If there were at most 3 pCRs among the first 25 patients  the regimen would be\ndeclared ineffective and the trial would stop  Secondary endpoints included adverse event\nprofile  clinical response rate  percent of planned dose administered per cycle  We also\ncollected information to understand the surgical management of operable breast cancer\npatients who undergo PST  A specific surgical treatment was not mandated in the protocol\n\nRoy et al  Page

that axillary staging was required in all patients  The type of breast surgery  and\nspecifics of pre-operative or post-operative sampling were left to the discretion of the\ntreating surgeon  Surgical data were collected by retrospective chart review \n\nAll analysis was conducted on the intent-to-treat principle  The proportion of pCR is\nestimated by the number of patients who achieved a pCR divided by the total number of\nevaluable patients  Similarly  the proportion of other events such as clinical responses is\nestimated by dividing the number of patients who achieved the event in question by the total\nnumber of evaluable patients  Exact binomial CIs were constructed for all of the above rates \nAdverse event profile  percent of planned dose administered  and surgical data are presented\nusing simple descriptive statistics \n\nRESULTS\nFifty Seven patients were enrolled over a 22 month period in this multiinstitution trial  All\npatients were evaluable for response and toxicity  The median age of this all women cohort\nwas 53 years  range  27–79  Tumor size ranged from 2 – 15 4 cm  median 5 cm  Thirty-\neight  67%  had ER+  31  54%  PR+  and 6  11%  HER2+ BC  Nine  16%  patients had ER \nPR and HER2 negative cancer  Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1 \n\nFollow-Up\nAt the time of this report  all 57 women have completed pre-operative chemotherapy and\nsurgical treatment  Forty-eight  84%  completed the study per protocol  i e  they received all\n4 cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery within the protocol defined time  The\nremaining 9 women could not complete the study per protocol due to  disease progression\n 3  adverse events  3 – neuropathy  elevated liver enzymes  and multiple AEs that led to a\n3rd dose reduction of chemotherapy  MD discretion  2  and personal choice  1  A median\nof 4 cycles  range 1–4  of chemotherapy treatment was given  Fifty-one  89%  underwent\nsurgery with in 42 days of the end of chemotherapy  including 3 women who did not\nsuccessfully complete 4 cycles of chemotherapy  Median followup of surviving patients\nwas 38 months  2–57 months  The progression free survival rates were 89%  84%  and 76%\nat 1-year  2-year and 3-year  respectively  The overall survival rates at these time points\nwere 98%  96% and 89%  respectively \n\nSafety and Tolerability\nThe regimen was well tolerated  The only grade 4 toxicity was thrombocytopenia seen in 5%\nof subjects  The most common severe  grade 3 or higher  toxicities  possibly  probably  or\ndefinitely related to study drug  were decreased platelets  19%  fatigue  14%  anemia\n 9%  and diarrhea  7%  Other commonly experienced events regardless of grade were \nalopecia  93%  nausea  81%  bone pain  53%  myalgia  51%  and peripheral sensory\nneuropathy  51%  See Table 2 for more toxicity information  Fifty-two of the 57 patients\nreceived all 4 planned chemotherapy treatments  The median dose of docetaxel administered\nwas the protocol planned dose of 75 mg/m2  Sixteen patients required docetaxel dose\nreductions in 23 instances with the most common reasons being hepatic enzyme elevation\n 8  and other non-hematologic adverse events  7  The median dose of carboplatin\nadministered was the protocol planned dose of AUC=6  Four patients required carboplatin\ndose reductions in 4 instances because of  hand/foot syndrome  2  ALT elevation  1  and\nthrombocytopenia  1  One pegfilgrastim dose reduction occurred due to physician\ndiscretion  Treatment delay occurred in 15 patients  23 instances  most commonly due to\nthrombocytopenia  16 \n\nRoy et al  Page 4\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 December 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

2-stage Simon design  Fifty-one patients\ncompleted surgery within 42 days of the last chemotherapy according to the protocol  Nine\nof them  18%  95% CI  8–31%  achieved a pCR  If patients were not able to have surgery\nwith in the protocol required time of 42 days after the last chemotherapy  they were\nconsidered not to have achieved a pCR  Overall  9  16%  90% CI  7–28%  of 57 patients\nachieved a pCR  Four of 9  44%  pts with ER/PR and HER2 negative BC had pCR  Fourty-\nthree out of 57 eligible patients  75%  95%CI  62%–86%  had clinical response  15  26% \nhad cCR  and 28  49%  cPR \n\nComplete surgical data  collected retrospectively by chart review  were available for 50\npatients  A specific surgical therapy was not mandated in the protocol  The majority of\npatients underwent mastectomy  n=33  66%  Of these  3  9%  underwent immediate\nreconstruction and 8  24%  also underwent a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy  The\ngreatest variation of surgical therapy was noted in axillary staging  Twenty  40%  had\naxillary staging prior to systemic chemotherapy  5 underwent sentinel lymph node  SLN \nbiopsy and 15 image-guided axillary biopsy  All the patients found to have a positive SLN\nor image-guided axillary biopsy prior to PST  had further axillary staging after PST  Those\nfound to be SLN negative pre-PST  had no further axillary surgery whereas those with\nnegative axillary evaluation by imaging and/or biopsy  underwent further axillary staging  1\npatient  after PST  Thirty  60%  had axillary staging after systemic chemotherapy  Of those \n17  67%  patients underwent SLN biopsy whereas 3  10%  presented with palpable axillary\nlymph nodes and underwent a complete lymph node dissection  The remaining patients\n n=10  33%  underwent a complete axillary lymph node dissection without documentation\nof palpable axillary lymph nodes at the initiation or completion of chemotherapy \n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this phase II multicenter trial we show that a two-weekly regimen of docetaxel and\ncarboplatin followed by pegfilgrastim is feasible as neoadjuvant therapy for breast\ncarcinoma  This regimen was associated with similar toxicity and pCR rates described with\nother anthracycline containing regimens  Thrombocytopenia was the only grade 4 toxicity\nseen in 5% of subjects  It was also the most frequent grade 3 adverse event seen in 14% of\nindividuals  See Table 2 for more details regarding toxicities  Fifty-two of the 57  91%  of\npatients were able to complete all four planned chemotherapy regimens although 17  29% \nrequired dose reduction  mainly in docetaxel dosing  due to toxicity  Ninety percent of\npatients were able to have surgery within 6 weeks of last chemotherapy and no increase in\nsurgical morbidity or complications was noted \n\nThe regimen was associated with a high rate of clinical responses  Nine of 57  16%  had a\ncomplete pathologic complete response and 4 of the 9 patients  44%  with triple negative\nbreast cancer achieved pCR  Different definitions of pCR have been used in the literature \nWe defined pCR stringently as absence of invasive and non-invasive cancer in the breast\nand axilla as recommended by a recent expert panel 17 Other investigators have defined pCR\nas absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast or lymph nodes  but residual DCIS is\nallowed 18–20 In a retrospective analysis of over 2000 patients  residual DCIS in patients\nwho experienced complete eradication of the invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes\ndid not adversely affect survival or local recurrence rate 21\n\npCR rate of 16% seen in our study is comparable to the rates seen in other studies that utilize\n4 cycles of anthracycline based therapy in 2 or 3 weekly schedule 1 3 5 7 15 22–24\n\nRoy et al  Page 5\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 December 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nBeing anthracycline free this regimen is particularly suited for patients who are not\ncandidates for anthracycline therapy  Since cumulative cardiac toxicity is not a concern with\nthis regimen  longer duration of treatment  additional cycles of chemotherapy  for 6 or 8\ncycles may be possible at acceptable toxicity  The cytoreductive effect of intermittently\nadministered chemotherapy accumulates as additional cycles are administered  till a\nmaximum response is obtained  Thus  the number of chemotherapy courses in the\nneoadjuvant setting may have a significant impact on response  The optimal duration or\nnumber of chemotherapy treatments before definitive surgery is not known and is likely\ndependent on the characteristics of the tumor as well as the chemotherapy agents being\nutilized  However  there is some evidence in the literature that more than 4 cycles may be\nneeded for optimal response  In a randomized comparison of 6 versus 3 of epidoxorubicin/\ndocetaxel combination for stage II or III breast cancer  pCR rate of 36% compared to 10%\nwas seen after 6 cycles 25 Similar improvement in pCR  24% v 17%  and clinical response\nrate  32% v 20%  was noted with 6 versus 4 cycles of doxorubicin / paclitaxel administered\nas neoadjuvant therapy 26 In the Aberdeen trial patients received 4 cycles of CVAP and the\nresponders were randomized to receive either 4 more cycles of CVAP or 4 cycles of\ndocetaxel  Improvement in clinical response rate was seen in both cohorts  cCR was 14%\nafter initial 4 cycles of CVAP  33% after 4 more cycles of CVAP and 56% after 4 cycles of\nCVAP followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel 1 In our study we utilized 4 cycles of\nchemotherapy followed by surgery  It is possible that additional cycles of therapy may\nimprove clinical and pathological response rates but a large prospective trial will be required\nto evaluate that possibility \n\nTriple negative breast cancer  TNBC  is defined by lack of expression of ER  PR or HER2\noverexpression  This is a distinct subtype of breast cancer and this phenotype predicts a\nbasal-like gene expression profile with high sensitivity and almost 100% specificity 27\nTNBC exhibit several poor risk characteristics including high grade and proliferative index\nand have the poorest prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes 28 29 Impaired BRCA1 function\nand DNA repair mechanisms in TNBC may render them particularly susceptible to\nbifunctional alkylating agents and platinum compounds that act by creating interstrand DNA\ncross linkage 30 A pCR rate of 44% was noted in patients with TNBC in our cohort  A\nrecent study by Kern et al also found high pCR rates with carboplatin and docetaxel given\nevery 21 days for 6 cycles in their cohort of 13 patients with early stage breast cancer 31\nFurther studies are needed to confirm this finding in a larger cohort of TNBC patients \n\nTo summarize  4 cycles of 2-weekly carboplatin and docetaxel followed by pegfilgratim is\nan active regimen for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with acceptable toxicity\nprofile and leads to pCR rates similar to other anthracycline containing regimens  This\nregimen may be particularly attractive for patients who are not suitable candidates to receive\nanthracycline  An impressive high pCR rate of 44% was seen in TNBC  a finding that needs\nto be validated in larger prospective trials  Carboplatin / docetaxel combination may serve as\na chemotherapy backbone to combine with other targeted therapies in future trials \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was conducted as a collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group  NCCTG  and\nMayo Clinic and was supported in part by Public Health

excludes\nMedicare Advantage enrollees \n\nObjectives—To assess the accuracy of chemo- and hormone therapy treatment data available via\nthe Cancer Research Network’s Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW \nResearch Design—Retrospective  longitudinal cohort study  Medical record-abstracted  tumor\nregistry-indicated treatments  “gold standard”  were compared to VDW-indicated treatments\nderived from HMO pharmacy  electronic medical record  and claim-based data systems \n\nSubjects—Enrollees aged 18 years and older diagnosed with incident breast  colorectal  lung or\nprostate cancer from 2000 through 2008 \n\nMeasures—Sensitivity  specificity  and positive predictive value  PPV  were computed at six-\nand 12-months post-cancer diagnosis \n\nResults—Approximately 45% of all cancer cases  total N=23 800  were aged 64 years or\nyounger  Overall chemotherapy sensitivity/specificities across the three health plans for incident\nbreast  colorectal  lung  and prostate cancer cases were 95%/90%  95%/93%  93%/93%  and 85%/\n77%  respectively  With the exception of prostate cancer cases  overall PPV ranged from 86% to\n89%  Small variations in chemotherapy data accuracy existed by cancer site and data source  while\ngreater variation existed in hormone therapy capture across sites \n\nConclusions—Strong concordance exists between gold standard tumor registry measures of\nchemotherapy receipt and CRN VDW data  HMO VDW data can be used for a variety of studies\naddressing patterns of cancer care and comparative effectiveness research that previously could\nonly be conducted among elderly SEER-Medicare populations \n\nCORRESPONDING AUTHOR Debra P  Ritzwoller PhD  The Institute for Health Research  Kaiser Permanente Colorado  PO Box\n378066  Denver  CO 80237-8066

limited to the linked Surveillance  Epidemiology and End Results  SEER -Medicare\ndata  National Comprehensive Cancer Network  NCCN  studies  or randomized clinical\ntrials  RCTs   1–3  While several studies have documented the reliability of SEER-\nMedicare data to capture chemotherapy administration  4  5  SEER-Medicare data do not\ninclude details on treatment patterns and outcomes of cancer care for patients aged younger\nthan 65 years or those receiving their care in health maintenance organizations  HMOs \nFurthermore  detailed data on the use of antineoplastic agents are often captured only for a\nselect group of patients that are not representative of the broader population of cancer\npatients  5  6  Generalizable data are needed to conduct comparative effectiveness research\non treatment options commonly used in community-based oncology practices \n\nSuch data are potentially available from HMOs that participate in the National Cancer\nInstitute  NCI -funded Cancer Research Network  CRN   7–9  CRN HMOs compile and\nmaintain data from internal  automated information systems in a distributed data network\nentitled the “Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW ”  10  11  VDW encounter  claims  and\nelectronic medical record data have  in turn  been linked to validated tumor registry data\nderived from the abstraction of HMO enrollee charts using methods similar to  or in some\ncases equivalent to  SEER registries  http //seer cancer gov/  last accessed 01/03/2012 \nPrior CRN research using “Virtual Tumor Registry”  VTR  data linked to VDW data has\nfocused primarily on surveillance/screening  12–15  epidemiologic  16  17  and\nsurvivorship studies  18  19  However  the VDW also captures HMO enrollees’ use of\nantineoplastic agents and could therefore serve as a resource for population-based research\non treatment patterns  diffusion of new therapies  and costs associated with the cancer\ntreatment services provided in community settings for patients not currently represented by\ndata derived from SEER-Medicare or RCTs \n\nOne of the challenges to using HMO automated data is lack of published validation studies\nassessing the quality of automated data against a consistent gold standard  Health\ninformation systems vary across HMOs  different hardware platforms and software vendors \nand over time  upgrades to software and changes in vendors  Data derived from treatment \npayment  and operations sources are not collected under research standards  data are entered\nby a multitude of clinicians and staff members with little redundant entry to assess\nreliability  Many uncontrolled factors underlying treatment  payment  and operations data\ncreate a need for formal evaluation of the validity and reliability of these data \n\nTo validate the usefulness of CRN VDW data for the capture of chemo- and hormone\ntherapy treatment among cancer patients aged 18 and older  we assessed the sensitivity \nspecificity  and positive predictive value  PPV  of indicators of first-course chemotherapy\nand hormone therapies found in the CRN VDW compared to a “gold standard” of chart-\nabstracted measures of first course treatment contained in the tumor registries of three CRN\nHMOs \n\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Setting\n\nThis was a retrospective  longitudinal cohort study conducted within three non-profit HMOs\n[the Colorado

HMOs  the majority of ambulatory cancer\ncare is delivered in plan-owned facilities  This project was approved by the Institutional\nReview Boards of the three participating HMOs \n\nData Sources\nThe primary data source for this analysis was the CRN’s Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW \nThe VDW is a standardized data system in which CRN participating HMOs retain local\ncontrol of their data  but a programmer at one site can write a program than can be run at all\nsites  10  11  The Virtual Tumor Registry  VTR  contains standardized data derived from\neach CRN HMO’s tumor registry  The VTR

American Joint\nCommittee on Cancer  AJCC  stage  and receipt of primary chemotherapy  immunotherapy \nhormone therapy  and surgical and radiotherapy  that are obtained from manual reviews of\ncancer patients’ medical charts  Information from the VTR can be considered a gold\nstandard for cancer treatment information because data contained within the VTR were\ncollected by certified tumor registrars  CTRs  who review all elements of each patient’s\nmedical record  including pathology reports  imaging reports  infusion session summaries \nsurgical operation reports  physician orders  for chemotherapy and hormonal therapy  and\nclinician progress notes  For the three HMOs included in this study  two have internal\nregistries staffed with fulltime CTRs  neither are SEER sites  but both report NAACCR\nstandard cases and fields to their respective State registries  The third HMO receives tumor\nregistry data feeds  in NAACCR format  from the SEER Cancer Surveillance System  All\ndiagnosis and treatment data provided to health plan enrollees were available for medical\nrecord review by the CTRs  Some variation was observed across the CRN sites and over\ntime with respect to the capture of specific tumor registry variables  For example  not all\nCRN VTRs captured variables including date of first chemotherapy or hormone therapy\ntreatment for all years included in this study \n\nVDW diagnosis and procedure files include coded diagnoses and procedures associated with\ninpatient and outpatient encounters or events  These codes are based on International\nClassification of Diseases  9th Revision  Clinical Modification  ICD-9-CM  codes \nHealthcare Common Procedure Coding System  HCPCS  codes  or the Fourth Edition of the\nCommon Procedure Terminology codes  CPT-4  Greater than 90% of the VDW diagnosis\nand procedure data used in this analysis were derived from electronic medical records\n EMRs  These data capture the diagnoses and treatment associated with the chemotherapy\nevents that take place predominately in health plan owned ambulatory infusion centers \nClaims data included in these analyses were associated with cancer treatments administered\nby contract providers including hospital based care  VDW pharmacy files capture national\ndrug code  NDC  based prescription drugs dispensed from both outpatient pharmacies and\nHMO-owned infusion centers  VDW files  VTR  Procedure  Diagnosis  and Pharmacy  were\nlinked by programmers at the individual CRN sites using individual medical record\nidentifiers  These identifiers were then stripped from the analytic data sets prior to pooling\ndata for final analyses  In this analysis  and consistent with Warren et al  4  we focused on\nthe ability of the VDW to capture definitive first course chemotherapy and hormone therapy\nat 6 months following a patient’s incident cancer diagnosis date from four VDW files  VTR \nPharmacy  Procedures  and Diagnoses during the period of 01/01/2000 through 12/31/2008 \nGiven the potential for the delay in first course treatment  we repeated this analysis at 12\nmonths post incident cancer diagnosis \n\nRitzwoller

Sample\nCancer cases were identified in the VTR as individuals diagnosed with breast  colorectal \nlung  or prostate cancer between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2007  aged 18 or older at diagnosis \nand eligible for care in one of the three HMOs for the year prior to and including the date of\ndiagnosis \n\nIdentification of Chemotherapy\nCancer therapy “look-up” tables were created by extracting codes from published research\n 4  6  21  NCI websites  22  23  plan-specific formularies  and expert clinician opinion\n from medical Oncologists and pharmacists with doctoral level training practice primarily or\nexclusively in oncology settings  These look-up tables contain over 2 000 NDC and 300\nprocedure and diagnosis treatment-related codes  Please see Tables 4  5  and 6 \nSupplemental Digital Content 1  which contains the lists of codes included in this study  In\naddition  these tables are accessible via the CRN public website  http //crn cancer gov/ \nUsing these chemotherapy and hormone specific NDC  procedure and diagnosis codes \nvariables were created and stratified by class of product  chemotherapy vs  hormone\ntherapy  These lookup tables were then mapped to the VDW pharmacy  procedure  and\ndiagnosis files using individual medical record identifiers for all incident breast  colorectal \nlung or prostate cancer cases identified from the VTR  as noted above  If one or more\nchemotherapy-related or hormone therapy-related event was captured in the VDW files\nwithin the first six months following the incident diagnosis date then the patient was flagged\nas receiving therapy at six months  Similarly  if a chemotherapy-related event occurred\nwithin the first 12 months following the incident diagnosis date  then the patient was flagged\nas receiving therapy at 12 months  The first date of a VDW captured treatment event in one\nor more of the VDW files  pharmacy  procedure  or diagnosis  that occurred after the\nincident cancer diagnosis date noted in the VTR was considered the first chemotherapy or\nhormone therapy event  The chart-abstracted VTR data was extracted from each health plan\nfrom the “first course of chemotherapy  or hormone therapy ” variable  If the “first course\nchemotherapy” variable was coded as 01  02  or 03  chemotherapy  NOS  chemotherapy \nsingle agent  and chemotherapy  multiple agents  the patient was flagged as having received\nchemotherapy  Similarly  if the “first course hormone therapy” was coded as 01  “hormone\ntherapy including NOS and antihormone”  then the patient was flagged as having received\nhormone therapy treatment \n\nData Analysis\nFor each cancer case  we compared results from the VTR to results from the VDW for\nchemotherapy and hormone therapy  Due to the small number of cases across all cancers\nreceiving immunotherapy  n=111  we excluded immunotherapy from this analysis  For six\nand 12 months post cancer diagnosis  we computed sensitivity  proportion of those who\nwere flagged in the VTR as having received treatment and in the VDW as having received\ntreatment  specificity  proportion of those who were flagged in the VTR as NOT receiving\ntreatment and in the VDW as not receiving treatment  and PPV  proportion of those flagged\nas receiving treatment in the VDW who were correctly identified as receiving treatment by\nthe VTR  by cancer site  We then stratified the data by stage  HMO and year  Finally  we\nexamined variation in the sensitivity and specificity of the VDW data source  pharmacy\nversus procedure and diagnosis files  The pharmacy files capture dispensing of drugs to the\ninfusion unit or outpatient pharmacy  while the procedure and diagnosis files capture\nadministration of infusions \n\nRitzwoller et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care

study period  8 543 breast cancer cases  4 399 colorectal cases  4 713\nlung cases  and 6 145 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the participating CRN HMOs \nThe proportions of breast  colorectal  lung and prostate cancer cases diagnosed prior to age\n65 were 59%  37%  32%  and 42%  respectively  The distributions of incident cancer cases\nby health plan  cancer site  stage  and year of diagnosis  as well as the proportions of cases\nindicated by the VTR as receiving chemotherapy or hormone therapy are shown in Table 1 \nThe majority of breast and prostate cancer cases  in total and by health plan  were initially\ndiagnosed at early stages  while colorectal cases were more evenly distributed across all\nstages  Lung cancers were predominantly diagnosed at later stages  While not shown here \nthe distribution of cancer cases by health plan and diagnosis year was relatively stable  with\na slight linear increase  from 11 6% in 2000 to 14 2% in 2007  over the observation period \nWe were unable to link 0 3%  N=83  of the cancer cases identified in VTR to the VDW\nfiles \n\nChemotherapy Concordance\nSensitivity across all three HMOs was highest for breast  95 5%  followed by colorectal\n 95 1%  lung  93%  and prostate cancer  85 5%   Table 2  Specificity for breast \ncolorectal  lung  and prostate was 89 8%  92 6%  92 6%  and 76 6%  respectively  Positive\npredictive values were generally high  >86%  except for prostate cases  6 3%  Sensitivity\nand specificity varied slightly by health plan with overall measures of concordance the\nlowest for HMO A  Minimal variation in sensitivity and specificity was noted by stage or\nyear of diagnosis \n\nWhen the observation period post-diagnosis was extended to 12 months  the sensitivity\nincreased by 0 6 percentage points for colorectal and lung cancer cases and 0 4 percentage\npoints for breast cancer cases  no change was observed for prostate cancer cases \nSpecificity decreased for breast  colorectal  lung  and prostate cancer cases by 0 4  2 3  1 5 \nand 2 5 percentage points  respectively  data not shown \n\nTable 3 describes the changes in the sensitivity and specificity when the analysis was limited\nto either only VDW pharmacy NDC data  or only procedures and diagnosis codes associated\nfrom outpatient or inpatient encounters derived from the EMRs or claims data  Using\npharmacy data only  the largest percentage point decline in sensitivity was found for HMO\nA across all four cancers  34 4 – 54 6 percentage points  and for prostate cancers at HMO B\n 42 9 percentage point decline  However  specificity improved from 18 8 to 33 6 \npercentage points for the same cases  Using only diagnosis and procedure codes  minimal\nchanges were found for HMO A  but large percentage point declines in sensitivity across all\nfour cancer sites were found for HMO C  with no improvement in specificity  Moderate\ndeclines in the sensitivity  7 8 – 14 percentage points  were found for breast  colorectal and\nlung cases at HMO B \n\nHormone Therapy Concordance\nHormone treatment was noted in the VTR data for 4 903  107  33  and 1 706 breast \ncolorectal  lung  and prostate cancer cases  respectively  While specificity was high for all\ncancer sites and HMOs  consistent with the small number of cases receiving hormone\ntherapy  sensitivity was lowest for colorectal  49 5%  and lung cancer  48 5%  as compared\nto 72 3% for breast and 78% for prostate cancer  Table 4  In contrast to the chemotherapy\nanalysis  hormone treatment sensitivity increased 19 9 and 8 2% percentage points for breast\nand prostate cancer  respectively  when the observation period was extended to 12 months\npost diagnosis  data not shown  Concordance across cancers fell slightly when the

1\npercentage points for breast and prostate cancer  respectively  Due to the small number of\ncolorectal and lung cancer patients receiving hormone therapy  we did not estimate changes\nin sensitivity or specificity by source of data \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first evaluation of the consistency between gold-standard tumor registry data and\nautomated data derived from the CRN VDW with respect to chemotherapy and hormone\ntherapy use for HMO enrollees aged 18 years or older diagnosed with one of the four most\ncommon cancers in the United States  We found that CRN VDW data associated with coded\ndiagnoses  procedures and prescription drug use  when used in combination  have both high\n >90%  sensitivity and specificity for identifying chemotherapy use among breast \ncolorectal  and lung cancer cases relative to chemotherapy treatment data derived from the\nchart-abstracted tumor registries  This analysis extends the work of Aiello and colleagues\n 24  conducted in these same HMOs  which compared chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\npatients  based on CPT-4  NDC  and ICD-9-CM codes  to tumor registries and found an\noverall sensitivity of 89% \n\nDifferences found in sensitivity and specificity by HMO and by data source  pharmacy vs \nother  could be explained by the differences in source data systems  Two of the three HMOs\nhave “in-house” tumor registries employing trained full-time CTRs to conduct\ncomprehensive chart audits  while the third populated their VTR from automated SEER data\nfiles  The SEER derived data may be less complete than the “in-house” registries because\nSEER abstractors do not have continuous access to medical records  which increases the\nbarriers to additional updates beyond the initial chart review  Also consistent with the\nfindings of Aiello and colleagues  24  we found that using only one source of data  e g \npharmacy only  was insufficient for capturing pharmacologic treatment data  Two of the\nthree HMOs had equal capture of pharmacologic events from both the VDW pharmacy and\nutilization files  capture of both NDC and HCPCS or CPT-4 codes  for over 90% of the\ncases receiving chemotherapy  while the third captured chemotherapy events predominately\nfrom encounter based diagnoses and procedure files—less than 50% of the cases had a\nchemotherapy-related NDC code  This likely reflects differences in the organization of\npharmacy systems within the plan-owned infusion centers \n\nWe found the sensitivity of chemotherapy use capture could be improved only slightly   90% overall  Chemotherapy is frequently only\ninitiated in prostate cancer for advanced disease or with progression or recurrence  26  27 \n\nRitzwoller et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript

in the VTR received primary\nchemotherapy treatment  while 27% of cases within the VDW pharmacy or procedure data\nreceived chemotherapy within 12 months of the diagnosis date  The hormone therapy PPV\nvalues are consistent with use of a variety of treatment approaches that can be initiated at\nvarious times post-diagnosis 28 \n\nThere are several limitations associated with this study  We did not conduct chart reviews of\nfalse negative cases  indicated as having treatments from VTR data  but no VDW pharmacy \nprocedure  or diagnosis-related event  At least some of these cases likely reflect 3–5% of\ncancer patients  enrolled in these HMOs  who are participating in chemotherapy-related\nclinical trials  The health plan is not liable for the cost of the chemotherapy  nor is the trial\ndrug necessarily part of the health plan’s pharmacy formulary  Therefore  if the trial drug\nwas administered at a cancer center or by another contract provider  it would be noted in the\nchart abstracted tumor registry  but no claim would be generated  If the trial drug was\nadministered by the plan-owned infusion center  the trial drug may not be captured or\nincluded in the traditional pharmacy systems  In addition  the two health plans with internal\ntumor registries  non-SEER  generally perform chart abstraction on most cases within 6 to 8\nmonths of the cancer diagnosis date  However  the CTRs at these plans have continuous\naccess to the patient’s EMR  allowing for abstraction updates in cases when first course\ntreatment may be delayed by several months  This may result in a longer follow-up\nabstraction period relative to SEER registries  The potential for differences in SEER/non-\nSEER abstraction follow-up could also be the source of variation in specificities across\nhealth plans  Further  while we assumed that the first chemotherapy event following the\ndiagnosis date of one of the four cancers of interest corresponded to that cancer  we did not\nlimit cases to sequence 0  first incident cancer  It is therefore possible that we are\nidentifying cancer treatments associated with a previous cancer diagnoses  Future studies\nshould also explore product  or regimen-level specificities  sensitivities  and PPVs \nconsistent with Warren and colleagues 4  particularly as standardized electronic infusion\ntherapy record systems are deployed across the majority of the CRN HMOs  further\nimproving the quality and clarity of antineoplastic data \n\nRegardless of future data refinements  the results of the current multi-site analysis reveal\nthat CRN VDW-based cancer treatment data are as sensitive and specific as Medicare fee-\nfor-service claims data in identifying receipt of antineoplastic therapy—the dominant data\nsource used for research related to cancer treatment and outcomes  4  6  29  Furthermore \nthis study highlights the ability of the CRN VDW to capture hormonal and oral\nchemotherapeutics at a time when Medicare Part D pharmacy data are not currently\navailable via linked SEER-Medicare files  Finally  our study is one of a limited few that\nincludes a representative population of cancer patients under the age of 65 years  This\nunique  comprehensive  and reliable data source sets the stage for patterns of care analyses\nand comparative effectiveness research in community-based oncology settings that will\ninform policy and medical practice by enabling better understanding of similarities and\ndifferences in cancer epidemiology  treatment patterns  and outcomes between aged and\nnon-aged populations and between capitated and fee-for-service reimbursement systems \n\nAcknowledgments\nFunding for this research was provided by NCI Grant No  R01 CA114204  Medical Care Burden of Cancer  System\nand Data

\n\nObjectives—To compare rates of received versus reported adjuvant breast cancer treatments \nand to assess barriers to measuring and reporting treatments to the tumor registry  TR  of a high-\nvolume medical center with both hospital-based and community-based oncologists \n\nResearch Design—We calculated rates of received treatments using data collected using chart\nabstraction  N = 115  and compared these with rates of reported treatments from the TR  N =\n535  We conducted 31 indepth interviews with clinical and administrative informants  Asking\nabout perceptions of the TR  current reporting methods  and reporting barriers  Interviews were\nrecorded  transcribed  and analyzed using deductive and inductive methods \n\nResults—Rates of reported versus received treatments were radiation therapy after breast-\nconserving surgery 22% versus 84%  P < 0 0001  chemotherapy for stage 2 or 3  17% versus\n79%  P < 0 0001  hormonal therapy for stage 2 or 3  1% versus 91%  P < 0 0001  Comparing\ncommunity-based versus hospital-based oncologists’ rates reported to the TR  we found the\nfollowing differences  radiation therapy post-breast conserving surgery 12% versus 32%  <\n0 0001  chemotherapy 8% versus 29%  < 0 0001  and hormonal therapy 0% versus 3%\n 0 09 We found 4 key barriers to measuring and reporting poor understanding about the TR \nlimited information technology capabilities  poor communication  and mistrust \n\nConclusions—Efforts to improve cancer care quality by improved treatment reporting must\novercome key barriers  especially those involving

measurement  reporting  communications  quality improvement\n\nIn 2007  the American College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer  in conjunction with the\nNational Quality Forum  took the bold step of adding measures of adjuvant breast and colon\ncancer treatments to their accreditation process  The step was bold as it made hospital tumor\nregistrars accountable for reporting care often delivered beyond hospital walls and\njurisdictions  and created a particular challenge for hospitals that had significant proportions\nof community-based physicians providing adjuvant treatments  Although reporting rates of\ntreatment is not yet required  these adjuvant treatment measures will likely serve as a basis\nfor the quality of care ratings  and possibly for reimbursement as pay-for-performance\nincentive systems extend to include new metrics 1 2 Moreover  given that measurement and\nreporting are the cornerstones of quality improvement efforts 3 it is imperative that these\ntreatment measurement and reporting processes be both timely and accurate \n\nAdjuvant cancer treatments are often given by different out-of-hospital physicians and few\npractices  whether hospital based or community based  are able to automatically identify and\nreport treatments  As a result  problems with the accuracy and underreporting of treatments\nprovided in the outpatient setting have been acknowledged and studied 4–6 In practice  the\naccuracy of treatment reporting has been found to vary with the level of decentralization of\ncare delivery  A study demonstrated better reporting of radiation therapy that was delivered\nthrough limited numbers of licensed facilities  as per statistical data from the National\nCancer Institute’s Surveillance  Epidemiology and End Results program  80% to 95% \ncompared with chemotherapy reporting that was more often delivered in oncologists’\nindividual offices  Surveillance  Epidemiology and End Results reports 60% complete\nchemotherapy data 7  the least accurate reporting was for hormonal therapies that can be\nwritten by any physician  36% accuracy 4\n\nMeasuring and reporting accurate adjuvant treatment data pose significant challenges to\nhospital tumor registries as they must obtain data from numerous sites both within the\nhospital  intraorganizational practice sites  and outside the hospital  interorganizational\npractice sites with varying affiliations and structures  Hospitals may have varying levels of\njurisdiction over independent office practices  thus creating difficulties when trying to\nensure comprehensive data reporting from these physicians’ practices  Furthermore  the\nability to report adjuvant treatments requires the ability to find that information  Despite the\nexplosive growth in electronic medical record  EMR  systems  only about one quarter of\nU S  physician practices use EMRs 8 and only 20% report receiving feedback about clinical\nperformance from their EMR systems 9 In addition  physicians are often concerned about\nreleasing data in the age of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act 10\nThese significant challenges thus hinder hospitals’ abilities to obtain  compile  and report\nadjuvant treatment data \nWe initiated this study to assess the scope of the problem of physicians’ reporting of\nadjuvant treatments to a hospital tumor registry  TR  and to improve our understanding of\ntreatment measurement and reporting barriers to inform future efforts aimed to improve\nbreast cancer treatment measurement and reporting \n\nBickell et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 June 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudy Setting\n\nOur study was conducted at a high breast cancer volume hospital that is both nestled\nbetween and serves the poorest and wealthiest communities in a large urban area  At the\ntime of our study  the hospital was striving to achieve the necessary standards for American\nCollege of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer accreditation  The single hospital locale\nincludes large numbers of community-based and hospital-based oncologists  with 17\nmedical and 2 radiation oncologists who treat breast cancer  Of these physicians  83% were\ncommunity-based in solo and group practices  and 17% were hospital based in faculty\npractices and resident clinics  All providers and practice sites were located within the same\nlarge  metropolitan area  The hospital had an EMR  albeit not an integrated one  The tumor\nregistrar had access to the radiation oncology electronic record and received regular feeds of\ndata from the pharmacy EMR and from the oncology clinics \n\nThis study was composed of 2 parts  a quantitative assessment of treatment reporting to the\nTR and a qualitative assessment of factors affecting treatment measurement and reporting \n\nQuantitative Assessment\nIn the quantitative component of our study  we compared treatments received with\ntreatments reported to the hospital TR during the same time period  The data providing\nevidence of adjuvant treatments received were collected as part of a National Cancer\nInstitute  NCI -funded study in which recruited women had a new  primary  early-stage\nbreast cancer  were treated at the study hospital between October 2006 and September 2009\nand consented to a trial-testing community-based patient assistance  Surgical  medical  and\nradiation treatment information was collected tthrough chart abstraction starting with review\nof charts in the surgeons’ offices and review of hospital-based records  and then involved\ntracking data further to oncologists’ office records  We identified treating oncologists\nthrough records in the surgeons’ offices  or via clues in the medical record  eg name of\nphysician ordering chemotherapy  hormonal or radiation treatments  referring physicians  If\nwe were unable to identify the oncologists  we contacted patients to obtain their physicians’\nnames and contact information \n\nFor comparison of data of treatments reported  we obtained adjuvant treatment data from the\nTR for stage 2 or 3 analytic cases undergoing surgery at the study hospital for the 2007 to\n2009 time period  We limited our NCI study and TR populations to stage 2 or 3 disease to\nmaximize the likelihood that the patients in this population would be appropriately treated\nwith adjuvant therapy \nAcross the 2 groups we classified hospital-based versus community-based physician\npractices on the basis of practice location  We then verified this classification after\nconsultation with a physician leader at the study hospital who was familiar with both full-\ntime and community-based voluntary physicians affiliated with the hospital \n\nWe compared the rates of treatments received versus treatments reported using t-tests  and\nperformed χ2 analyses to compare treatment rates between community-based and hospital-\nbased physicians \n\nQualitative Assessment\nIn our qualitative assessment 11 we used multiple key informant interviews to examine both\norganizations’ and physicians’ perspectives about treatment measurement and reporting for\nbreast cancer patients associated with the study hospital  We conformed to the standards of\n\nBickell et al  Page 3\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 June 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nrigorous qualitative research 12–14 paying special attention to in-depth interview15\ntechniques to conduct our study \n\nWe identified target informants based on their roles in providing or supporting the provision\nof breast cancer adjuvant treatments associated with patients who were surgically treated at\nthe study hospital  Hospital-based target informants included oncologists  administrators \nand clinical and information technology  IT  leaders of breast cancer care at the study\nhospital  and also the hospital tumor registrar  Community-based target informants included\nphysicians at each of the community-based practices and their office staff responsible for\ncommunicating with the hospital and with patients  Two key informants  6%  contacted\ndeclined to participate \n\nWe created semistructured interview guides tailored to key informant type  ie  physician \nleadership  administrative staff  and tumor registrar  to guide the interview process and\nstandardize probing by interview domain  We present the list of 4 general interview domains\nand sample topics covered in each domain in Table 1 \n\nInterviews lasted an average of 50 minutes  range  30–90 min  and were conducted in\nperson  One investigator led each interview  N A B  and a cointerviewer  A S M  J W \nwas present to assist  All interviews were recorded  transcribed  and then verified and\ncorrected by a study investigator  The Institutional Review Board of the study hospital\napproved this study \n\nAnalyses applied a combination of inductive and deductive methods using a grounded\ntheory approach 16 17 Throughout the study  members of the interview team read and\ndiscussed interview transcripts and preliminary findings  Our iterative analytic process\nenabled us to explore themes as they emerged in the data  and permitted us to verify\nemergent themes as our study progressed and we held additional key informant interviews \n\nAfter we had completed all of the interviews  we developed a coding team that was\ncomposed of the lead qualitative investigator  A S M  and a research assistant  R F \nThroughout the coding process  coders held regular discussions to ensure consistency of\ncoding and agreement about our identification of major themes around barriers to treatment\nmeasurement and reporting  We used the Atlas ti  version 6 0  software program to facilitate\nthe coding and analysis process 18\n\nRESULTS\nQuantitative Assessment\n\nOf the 115 women with a stage 2 or 3 breast cancer who participated in the NCI study  60%\nwere treated by community-based and 40% by hospital-based oncologists  In contrast  of the\n535 stage 2 or 3 breast cancer patients in the TR  52% were treated by community-based and\n48% by hospital-based oncologists  Treatment rates reported to the TR as compared with\ntreatments received as documented in the medical records were significantly different \nradiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery 22% versus 84%  P < 0 0001 \nchemotherapy 17% versus 79%  P < 0 0001  and hormonal therapy 1% versus 91%  P <\n0 0001 \n\nWe found notable differences between community-based and hospital-based oncologists’\nrates of treatments reported compared with received by type of practice setting  Table 2 \nRates reported from community-based oncologists were strikingly lower than from hospital-\nbased oncologists  There was no difference in rates of treatments received between hospital-\nbased and community-based physicians \n\nBickell et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care  Author

Population—We interviewed 31 organizational and clinical informants across the\nhospital and community sites  Table 3  Key informants included community-based and\nhospital-based surgical and radiation oncologists  organizational leaders  office staff  and the\nhospital tumor registrar \n\nBarriers to Tracking and Feedback—Across our key informant interviews  4 main\ntypes of barriers emerged around measurement and reporting of adjuvant therapies   1  poor\nunderstanding about the TR   2  limited information technologies   3  communication\nproblems  and  4  mistrust \n\nPoor Understanding about the Tumor Registry  A majority of respondents from both\nhospital-based and community-based practices had a poor understanding about the role of\nthe TR  thus creating an important measurement and reporting barrier  Several hospital-\nbased physicians were largely unaware about the registry and its goals  One commented that\n“I didn’t even know that we had a tumor registry ” Another asked the study investigators \n“How long have we had the tumor registry  For years ” Although community-based\nphysicians tended to be more aware of the existence of the registry  they were often\nconfused about what they were supposed to do with respect to reporting  As one reflected \n\n“The question is  am I supposed to be reporting all my patients to some entity  As\nfar as I know  I am not supposed to be  It is not HIV  As far as I know  it is not a\ncommunicable disease that puts the community at risk  So  what you are telling me\nis frankly surprising  Because I am a pretty responsible person  So  if I was\nsupposed to be reporting to someone  no one has told me ”\n\nPhysicians who were aware of the registry were still confused about its role  its value  and\nits potential  As a hospital-based physician explained  “…who do they want to get in our\ncancer registry  …Do they want every patient diagnosed with cancer  Then why am I only\ngetting notices for a couple of patients who were diagnosed when I was on service that I\ndon’t even follow-up with ” Another physician summarized  “The perception I think many\npeople have of the tumor registry is that its useless ”\n\nLimited ITs  When discussing approaches to measurement and reporting  most physicians\ndescribed how they tracked patients in the absence of supporting IT or electronic records \nand many commented about how the lack of integrated IT created a barrier  One\ncommunity-based physician explained  “Well  we have paper records  They are very\ncumbersome  and the filing is a nightmare ” When then asked about whether they had a way\nto easily determine what treatments a patient had  physicians explained how the process was\nnever easy  As one commented  even though he could find “all my patients that have\ncarcinoma of the breast” on his computer  there was no way to determine what treatments\nthe patients had received  “No  I would have to access their charts ”\n\nAs a result of this barrier  physicians had learned to make due given the technologies they\ndid or did not have in their practices  One hospital-based physician noted  “If I order a test  I\nmake a note in my Blackberry to follow it up ” A voluntary physician explained  “I know\nthe patients  They come in and I know when they are supposed to have X  Y  Z ”\n\nCommunication Problems with the Registry  There was a striking communication\ndisconnect between physicians and the tumor registrar’s office  Both community-based and\nhospital-based physicians reported that they never received requests from the TR to stage\npatients or provide any other information  One community-based physician noted  “I haven’t\n\nBickell et al  Page 5\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 June 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nbeen asked to report anything other than sending reports to referring doctors  which I feel I\nam obligated to do since they send me the patient  to keep them up to date ”\n\nYet  from the perspective of the tumor registrar  communications from the TR office were\nregular and clear  The registrar explained  “We will send information to the physicians’\noffices both internally and externally  Some [physicians] will be good  some will be very\ngood at responding…but outpatient is horrible ” Particularly frustrating  she reported  was\nwhen requests had to be repeated and repeated  “We fax  We refax  They insist they didn’t\nreceive it  We fax again  It’s ridiculous ” Further  when the study investigators shared the\ngeneral sense from physician respondents that the TR did not send any requests or that they\ndid not see any requests that were sent  the registrar responded  “Well if they don’t  then\nthey probably need to talk with their assistants ” Our interviews with office staff  however \ndid not support the TR office’s contention that their communications were clear or well\nunderstood \n\nEven processes that were established to facilitate reporting were often poorly\ncommunicated  One community-based physician described how he happened to discover the\nelectronic reporting program that enabled him to provide information to the TR [e-\nOutcomes] when he was cleaning out his email spam filter \n\n“e-Outcomes snuck up on me  I come home one day and I look through my spam\nfilter  It said e-outcomes  okay  It looks kind of official…  So I clicked on it and it\nturns out  yeah  this thing is pretty legit … That is how I stumbled on it and I said \n‘Wow  This is the real thing ’ And then I realized they had been trying to reach me\nfor awhile  …Because the thing is dated from a year earlier…  ”\n\nMistrust Between Physicians and the Hospital  Mistrust of the hospital emerged as an\nimportant barrier that provided insight into the contrasting perspectives of community-based\nand hospital-based physicians affiliated with the hospital organization  We identified 2\nsubthemes associated with the issue of reporting   1  mistrust about losing patients and  2 \nmistrust about data and privacy \n\nCommunity physicians expressed considerable skepticism about whether the hospital was\nlooking out for their best interests regarding losing patients to hospital-based physicians \nThe mistrust theme emerged in their comments about how the reporting process was\nsomehow one sided  and hinted that by providing more information to the hospital  it might\nsomehow make it easier for the hospital to “steal” their patients  As one explained  “When I\nrefer a patient to one of the full-time oncologists for whatever  I almost never get reports\nback and the patient disappears  I tell them  ‘Why should I send patients to XXX  If I send a\npatient to another institution for a bone marrow transplant  at least I get the patient back after\nit’s done ’”\n\nThe second mistrust subtheme involved community physicians’ mistrust about data and data\nprivacy  One community-based physician explained  “I’m very suspicious of what’s being\ndone with the information that I send any place  Stuff that I don’t send  it’s there ” Another\nnoted \n\n“Data can be abused  Once you start sharing data  you might even start off in a way\nwhere there was no real intent  But then  depending upon where that data resides  a\nyear from now you could have somebody who’s doing some research and say  ‘Oh \nI’ve got this data ’ And now suddenly somebody is doing an analysis which is\ntotally different than the original intention ”\n\nFrom the hospital’s perspective  comments did not clearly indicate any intent to abuse data\nintended for the registry  but informants did describe how reported data might be shared\n\nBickell et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2013 June 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\npublicly for quality improvement purposes  A member of medical leadership speculated\nabout the ability to encourage better quality of care by publishing data  commenting  “if you\npublish them  will people feel ashamed to do better  to improve ” The contrasting views of\ncommunity physicians’ and hospital administrations’ with respect to data and information\nexchange thus contributed to these physicians’ mistrust of the hospital itself \n\nDISCUSSION\nSignificance\n\nOur study suggests that the reporting of treatment data from hospital-based and especially\nfrom community-based physicians is problematic  and that the barriers to treatment\nreporting are not simply structural  Instead  issues such as communication and trust\ncomplicate the treatment measurement and reporting process  Nonetheless  accurate\nmeasurement and reporting of performance is the critical first step of any quality\nimprovement activity 3 and both are mandatory for American College of Surgeons’\nCommission on Cancer accreditation \n\nImproving the quality of breast cancer treatment reporting is challenging because much of\nadjuvant cancer care is delivered in individual  community-based physician office practices \nby multiple different providers  Even though hospitals may increasingly be held accountable\nfor the care provided in out-of-hospital physician office practices  they have variable\noversight capacity and little ability to change individual physician practices  We found\nsubstantial differences in rates of reported versus received adjuvant treatments  documenting\nthis reporting problem  and learned about important barriers to reporting that will have to be\naddressed  These differences are certainly troubling in the context of breast cancer adjuvant\ntherapy treatments  but also suggest that relying solely on reported rates of treatment to\nconfirm the quality of care provided may be problematic  Furthermore  given increasing\nreliance on reported treatments to calculate performance metrics and even determine\nincentive payments  eg  pay for performance  P4P  incentive systems  our finding about\ninaccurate reporting may be of particular concern \n\nMoving forward  the opportunity for hospitals striving to improve measurement and\nreporting of adjuvant breast cancer treatments appears 2-fold   1  educate and engage\nclinicians and their staff to ensure complete and accurate reporting  and  2  enable both in-\nhospital and community-based physician practices to increase reporting  Part of the solution\nclearly lies with improved IT availability and ongoing technologic support  For instance \nenhanced IT systems that enable automated reporting and/or integration of different\nelectronic health record systems can help improve the reliability of reporting as well as\nfacilitate better communications both among providers and institutions  However  although\ntechnology solutions can facilitate case identification and measurement  they do not\nguarantee reporting success  More challenging  perhaps  will be the need to engage\nclinicians in this process as this will likely require addressing underlying cultural beliefs  as\nwell as deep-seated values and issues associated with power in interorganizational\nrelationships  for example 19 20 that all may contribute to the perceived reporting barriers we\nfound \n\nLimitations\nOur study is limited in that we focused on a single urban hospital  making it potentially\ndifficult to generalize our findings to other settings  However  this single site has a high\nvolume of breast cancer cases served through both hospital-based and community-based\npractices  and patients included a combination of well-insured and Medicaid patients  thus\nproviding

of information transfer from intraorganizational hospital-based office\npractices and interorganizational community-based practices  offering insight that could\nostensibly be translated to other similarly diverse practice settings \n\nFurthermore  although our results provide evidence about the complexity of the treatment\nreporting process  we have no evidence that the solutions we discuss such as education \nawareness  and enhanced IT will solve the reporting problem  We did find persistence across\nthe themes and subthemes we report across respondent groups  thus indicating that these\nbarriers might be salient in other settings and applicable to other conditions involving\nmultidisciplinary care delivered in different organizational settings  However  our study was\nnot designed to study the impact of these solutions  Instead  the insight we provide about\nbarriers to treatment measurement and reporting can be used to help raise awareness about\nboth these challenges and potential solutions in the context of a difficult problem affecting\nthe quality of cancer care delivered in practice \n\nFuture research will benefit from similar mixed methods approaches  combining quantitative\nand qualitative data to explore the complex issues associated with delivering breast cancer\nadjuvant therapies in different practice settings  Studies designed to implement and evaluate\ninterventions to improve treatment measurement and reporting in similarly complex hospital\nand community-based settings would be particularly informative and help improve our\nability to increase the quality of care provided to cancer patients across settings \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe ability of hospital tumor registries to systematically and accurately capture and report\ncancer adjuvant treatments provided in busy outpatient practices is challenged by the\nlimitations of information systems  organizational barriers  and communications both within\nand outside the hospital  Yet  these treatment data can enable registrars to give real-time\nfeedback about needed therapies and interventions and thus  improve the quality of cancer\ncare delivered  Given increasing attention to performance metrics and public accountability\nfor cancer care delivered within and beyond institutional walls  both hospital administration\nand oncology practices should address underlying issues that affect trust and their abilities to\nmeasure and report cancer treatment  paying particular attention to opportunities to improve\ncommunication both within and across settings

hormone\nreceptor positive breast cancer 1–10  However  oncology patient adherence to daily oral\ntherapy is increasingly recognized as a challenge 11 12  For adjuvant hormonal therapy \nreported adherence rates range from 50% to 75%11 13–16  with discontinuation rates\nparticularly high during the first year 17–20  It has been estimated that half of breast cancer\npatients discontinue adjuvant endocrine treatment before the recommended five year\ntreatment period21  At least two cohort studies have now linked poor hormonal therapy\nadherence with adverse outcomes for breast cancer patients including recurrence22 and\nmortality23 \n\nOne factor that has been hypothesized to modify the effect of hormonal therapies on breast\ncancer outcomes is concomitant use of medications that interfere with the activity of the\ncytochrome P450 2D6  CYP2D6  enzyme that metabolizes tamoxifen24  It has been\nsuggested that concurrent use of CYP2D6 inhibitor medications and tamoxifen may result in\nreductions in plasma tamoxifen metabolites25 and possibly reduced treatment efficacy26 \nThus  concurrent use of CYP2D medications might be expected to moderate observed\nassociations between adjuvant hormonal medication adherence and breast cancer outcomes \nHowever  several recent studies failed to find an association between use of CYP2D6\ninhibitor medications and poorer breast cancer outcomes in the context of adjuvant\nhormonal therapy22 27 28  Although Dezentje and colleagues22 did not find evidence of\ninteractions between tamoxifen adherence and use of CYP2D6 inhibitor medications this\npossibility needs to be examined in a more diverse sample of women and for additional\nclinical endpoints \n\nWe previously reported low adherence  with only 60% reporting with medication possession\nratios  MPR  greater than 80%  to adjuvant hormonal therapy for early stage breast cancer29\namong low income women identified from a linked database of North Carolina  NC \nMedicaid and NC Central Cancer Registry  CCR 30 31  In this report  we describe the\nrelationship of adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy to breast cancer recurrence and\ndeath \n\nMETHODS\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Wake Forest University\nSchool of Medicine and at Duke University Medical Center \n\nDatabase\nMethods used to create the NC CCR-Medicaid linked dataset have been previously\ndescribed32  In NC  Medicaid is almost entirely fee-for service with one small managed care\nprogram    40  Elimination of patients not taking tamoxifen did not\nchange the interaction results \n\nDISCUSSION\nOur finding of no association between hormonal therapy adherence and breast cancer\noutcomes contrasts with recent studies reporting significant associations between adherence\nand breast cancer event-free time22 and all cause mortality23  Importantly  these studies\nincluded women from the Netherlands and Scotland with very different sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and generally better levels of adherence  means or medians of 93% compared\nto only 77% in our population  In addition  the reported hazards ratios in these positive\nstudies were small  HR=  99 for continuous adherence and recurrence and HR= 1 10 for\n\nWeaver et al  Page 5\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 April 01

and\nsurvival with higher adherence rates in our sample may include factors unique to this\npopulation of patients and/or breast cancers that develop in this population  methodological\nlimitations of claims data  and inability to detect what may have been a small effect \n\nOur measure of medical adherence  prescription refill data  was also used in prior studies of\nhormonal therapy and breast cancer outcomes  but has several limitations  First  it is possible\nthat patients did not take their medications  even if they filled their prescription  Second \nprescription refill data are subject to error introduced by receiving free samples of\nmedications and use of discount medications ordered from other sources  We believe the\nlater was unlikely to occur in this population because women in the cohort generally\nreceived prescription medications for free or at a very low cost  $1–$6 \n\nThere may be characteristics of this patient group that explain the lack of association\nbetween adherence and breast cancer recurrence and survival  Indeed  low socioeconomic\nstatus is known to be a risk factor for poorer outcomes after breast cancer generally40  Breast\ncancer treatment disparities  including underuse of adjuvant radiation following breast\nconserving surgery41  have been previously documented in this sample  In addition  there\nare known lifestyle factors  such as smoking  obesity  and physical inactivity that impact\noutcomes after breast cancer that are more common among women of low socioeconomic\nstatus 42–46  These factors may mask the effect of adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapies \nTumor characteristics unique to this population may explain the lack of association between\nadherence and breast cancer outcomes  Similar to other registry studies47  nearly a quarter of\nthe women in the study did not have hormone receptor data recorded in the cancer registry \nAll were prescribed adjuvant hormone therapy  but if a significant number of these\n“unknown” patients were actually ER/PR negative then the actual effect of adjuvant\nendocrine therapy may have been masked in this population \n\nWe defined hormone receptor positive as ER positive and/or PR positive  The importance of\nthe PR to the tumor’s response to hormonal therapy has been debated in the literature \nTumors that are both ER and PR positive  termed luminal A  respond more often to\nhormonal therapy than tumors that are ER positive and PR negative  termed luminal B  or\nthose that are ER negative and PR positive48 49  It is possible that this population of low\nincome women has a higher prevalence of ER positive  PR negative tumors that are less\nresponsive to hormonal therapy  It has been reported that the luminal A tumor type is less\ncommon among black women50  who comprised 40 8% of this sample  Differences in the\nprevalence of breast cancer subtypes by socioeconomic status have not been described  The\ntumor registry data from 1998–2002 did not contain information on human epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor-2  HER-2  status which distinguishes between the luminal subtypes \nHER-2 positivity may indicate resistance to hormonal therapy48 51  especially in ER+/PR−\nsubtypes  Controlling for tumor grade in the analysis may have partially accounted for this\neffect  since most HER-2 positive tumors are high grade \n\nPatient characteristics that decrease efficacy of adjuvant hormonal therapy are another\nconsideration  It has been reported that side effects are a major determinant of adherence to\nadjuvant hormonal therapy11 15 17  such that patients who have less side effects are more\nadherent to therapy  Lack of side effects might be related to increased tolerance for certain\nside effects or to drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacogenetics  For instance  tamoxifen is\nmetabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and patients who have low CYP2D6 enzyme\nactivity or who are taking medications that interfere with the activity of this enzyme are less\nprone to side effects from tamoxifen because there are less active metabolites24  The “poor\nmetabolizer” phenotype occurs in less than 10% of people and varies by ethnic group 52 53 \n\nWeaver et al  Page 6\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 April 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that the prevalence of low CYP2D6 metabolism is higher in this low\nsocioeconomic population  but  if it is  it could explain why we observed no association\nbetween adherence and outcomes  There are also many medications that interact with\nCYP2D6 and thereby decrease metabolism of tamoxifen to its more active metabolites24 52 \nWe examined this possibility in our dataset and found that use of CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor\nmedications was not independently associated with breast cancer outcomes and did not\ninteract with hormonal therapy adherence \n\nAlternatively  it is possible that current hormonal therapy dosing regimens are robust to\noccasional nonadherence  particularly if it is sporadic rather than sustained  e g  missing one\nor two days a week  rather than entire weeks  Tamoxifen has a relatively long half life\n approximately 7 days  and studies have found blood tamoxifen levels consistent with\nclinical response up to 21 days after drug discontinuation54  Anastrozole  letrozole  and\nexemestane have shorter half lives  1–3 days 55  Future studies should try to characterize the\npatterns of nonadherence \n\nOne limitation of the current study is the possible absence of some important confounding\nvariable that would explain the lack of significant associations between adherence and breast\ncancer outcomes  as is common among administrative or claims data  In a recent paper \nGiordano and colleagues 56 illustrate the difficulties of replicating results from randomized\nclinical trials using administrative data  In an effort to reduce selection bias  we limited our\nanalysis to cancer-related outcomes  rather than all-cause mortality  Relying solely on\nclinical trials data is not an option when researchers study groups that have traditionally\nunder-represented in trials  such as the elderly and individuals of low socioeconomic status \n\nFinally  the sample size and/or length of follow-up may have limited our ability to detect\ndifferences in breast cancer outcomes  particularly for cancer-free survival  In clinical trials \nsurvival differences with adjuvant hormonal therapy are typically seen at 5–10 years57  but\ncumulative reductions in mortality may be twice as big at 15 years1  It is more surprising\nthat with a mean follow-up years  we also saw no association between adherence and breast\ncancer recurrence  The relatively poor adjuvant endocrine adherence observed in this\npopulation may limit our ability to detect difference in recurrence within the study time\nperiod  In addition  if the women in this study also had limited compliance with post-cancer\ntreatment mammography surveillance  it is possible that detection of a breast cancer\nrecurrence could have been delayed until after the follow-up period of this study \n\nIn conclusion  in this database of low-income women with breast cancer who were enrolled\nin Medicaid  we did not observe a significant association between adherence to adjuvant\nhormonal therapies and breast cancer recurrence or death  Consistent with other recent\nstudies 22 27  we also did not observe either an independent association between use of\nCYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor medications and breast cancer outcomes or an interaction with\nhormonal therapy adherence  Although suboptimal adherence is considered to be an\nimportant clinical problem  its effects on breast cancer outcomes may be masked by patient\ngenetic profiles  tumor characteristics  and behavioral factors that may independently or\ninteractively influence patient outcomes after breast cancer \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material

to oral supplements of 300-mg CoQ10 or placebo  each combined\nwith 300-IU vitamin E  divided into 3 daily doses  Treatment was continued for 24 weeks  Blood\ntests  quality of life  QOL  measures  and levels of plasma CoQ10 and vitamin E were obtained at\nbaseline and at 8  16  and 24 weeks  Mixed-effects models were used to assess treatment\ndifferences in outcomes over time

 CoQ10  Cancer-Related Fatigue  Treatment-Related Fatigue  Breast Cancer \nRandomized Clinical Trial\n\nPublished data suggest that at least 80% of cancer patients who are undergoing treatment \nespecially multimodality therapy  experience a significant degree of fatigue that may\nnegatively impact their quality of life  QOL  emotional well-being  and treatment\ntolerance 1-11 Compared with the fatigue experienced by those without cancer  cancer-\nrelated fatigue is typically more severe and not reliably relieved by rest 12 Up to 80% of\nwomen receiving adjuvant breast cancer therapy may experience significant cancer and\ntreatment-related fatigue 13 Persistent fatigue may affect a significant number of these\nwomen  published data suggest that it may last for months or years after the completion of\ntherapy in at least 30% of patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies 14-18 For\nexample  81% of 1 372 women with breast cancer who had completed primary treatment\ndescribed fatigue during or following their therapy 19\n\nPatients perceive fatigue to be the most distressing symptom associated with their cancer\nexperience  even worse than pain or nausea and vomiting 4 However  studies suggest that\nfatigue usually does not exist in isolation  but rather as part of a symptom cluster that often\nincludes depression  difficulty sleeping  and pain 13 20 Current clinical practice guidelines\nrecommend a regular assessment of fatigue in all cancer patients during and following their\ntreatment 21 22 and several validated self-assessment tools for fatigue are available 23\n\nMultiple recent reviews summarizing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to\ntreating cancer-related fatigue have been published24-27  unfortunately  relatively few\npharmacologic interventions have been efficacious  Coenzyme Q10  also known as\nubiquinone  is a fat-soluble quinine with properties similar to vitamins 28 It is an antioxidant\nand a redox coenzyme of the respiratory chain29-31 that occurs naturally in the organs of\nmost animal species 32 as well as in relatively high levels in the heart  liver  kidney and\npancreas of humans 28 Biochemically  CoQ10 works by  1  having a direct regulatory role\n\nLesser et al  Page 2\n\nJ Support Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 March 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

occurring 5 to\n10 hours after ingestion 36 Normal plasma levels of CoQ10 range between 0 64 and1 06 µg/\nmL plasma 37-45 Males have higher levels than do females  older adults have lower levels of\nCoQ10 than do younger adults 46 The typical US diet provides approximately 5 mg to10 mg\nof CoQ10 per day  Side effects of CoQ10 may include insomnia  elevated liver enzymes \nrash  nausea  epigastric pain  dizziness  photophobia  irritability  headache  and\nheartburn47 48  however  regardless of the dosage used  few untoward effects have been\nobserved 49\n\nAlthough CoQ10 has been used for several decades as a dietary supplement for general\nhealth maintenance  the benefits of its administration have been most extensively evaluated\nin a variety of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions  In patients with congestive\nheart failure  CoQ10 supplementation to standard medical therapy improved QOL  New\nYork Heart Association classification  and congestive symptoms including shortness of\nbreath and edema 47 50-53 Similar benefits were seen in a study of patients with hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy 54 Ongoing CoQ10 administration has led to sustained decreases in both\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure 55 Finally  data suggest that high-dose CoQ10\nadministration may slow the functional decline experienced by patients with early-stage\nParkinson's disease 41\n\nIn light of its role in mitochondrial energy generation  CoQ10 supplementation has been\nevaluated in a variety of patient populations with fatigue  It has been clearly demonstrated to\nimprove the symptoms of weakness and fatigue in the rare patient with inherited defects in\nCoQ10 biosynthesis 56 57 CoQ10 administration also has beneficial effects on dyspnea and\nexercise tolerance—cardiac fatigue—in patients with congestive heart failure and/or\ncardiomyopathy 29 39 47 However  conflicting data exist regarding the effect of CoQ10 on\nfatigue in a normal population  Cooke et al58 described a trend toward an increased time to\nexhaustion following 2 weeks of CoQ10 intake  A number of other placebo-controlled\nstudies failed to demonstrate an improvement in physical functioning in similar trained and\nuntrained populations 59-63\n\nClinical and epidemiologic investigations of CoQ10 in cancer are limited  and the few small\nstudies that have been reported have evaluated the ability of CoQ10 supplementation to\nameliorate or prevent cardiotoxicity in patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy 64 65\nCoQ10 is a common supplement used by patients with breast and other cancers  its\npurported benefits include improved cancer- and treatment-related fatigue 66 However  no\nprospective data have been published on the efficacy of this supplement in the fatigued\ncancer population  As a result  we performed a randomized  double-blind  placebo controlled\nstudy of CoQ10 in women with breast cancer who were beginning adjuvant chemotherapy \nThe primary aim of this trial was to assess the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on\ntreatment-induced fatigue in these women  secondary goals were to assess the compound's\neffects on

this randomized  placebo controlled  double-blinded trial \nAdditional eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  ECOG \nperformance status ≤ 2  ability to provide written informed consent  a hemoglobin level ≥ 11\ng/dL  a total cholesterol level ≥ 160 mg/dL  a bilirubin level ≤ 1 5 × upper limit of normal\n ULN  a plasma glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase  SGOT  level ≤ 2 5 × ULN  and plasma\nglutamate pyruvate transaminase  SGPT  ≤ 2 5 × ULN  Additional ineligibility criteria\nincluded an involuntary loss of greater than 5% of body weight in the previous 3 months \ncurrent or planned statin therapy  current or planned use of medications for fatigue \nincluding corticosteroids  other than an allowable intermittent use as part of a chemotherapy\nregimen  amphetamines  or other stimulants including methylphenidate or modafinil \nuncontrolled hypertension  pregnancy  uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction  and current or\nplanned anticoagulant therapy  except for maintenance of catheter patency  The study was\napproved by the Institutional Review Board  IRB  of the Wake Forest School of Medicine\nand by each participating site's IRB  All study participants provided written informed\nconsent \n\nTreatment\nEligible patients were stratified by type of chemotherapy  anthracycline vs no anthracycline \nand whether or not they received radiation as part of their treatment course  Participants\nwere then randomized to receive daily oral supplements of either 300-mg CoQ10  Soft Gel\nTechnologies  Los Angeles  California  per day or placebo—each combined with 300-IU\nvitamin E  Soft Gel Technologies  Los Angeles  California —divided into 3 doses daily of\neither 100-mg CoQ10 or placebo  plus 100-IU vitamin E  Vitamin E served as a lipid carrier\nto improve absorption of the lipophilic CoQ10 molecule  CoQ10 or placebo supplements\nwere begun no later than 4 days after chemotherapy initiation  they were taken 3 times daily\nwith food for 24 weeks  Participants were instructed to avoid taking any additional\nsupplements containing CoQ10 or vitamin E for the duration of the study  Adherence to\nstudy medications was assessed by serial measures of serum CoQ10 and vitamin E levels at\nbaseline and following 8  16  and 24 weeks of therapy \n\nOutcome Measures\nSeveral QOL instruments were used to provide data on the primary outcome of fatigue  as\nwell as secondary end points including overall QOL  depression  and social support  all of\nwhich could affect fatigue in a given patient  Fatigue was measured via the POMS-F  a 7-\nquestion fatigue subscale of the Profile of Mood States assessment tool  in which items are\nrated for the past week on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 [not at all] to 4 [extremely] 67-70 \nthe FACIT-F  a 13-item fatigue scale from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness\nTherapy Measurement System  in which items are rated from 0 [not at all] to 4 [very\nmuch] 71 72  and a self-reported Linear Analog Scale Assessment - Fatigue  LASA-Fatigue \nin which patients were asked to rate their overall level of fatigue using a 100 millimeter line\nwith the anchors of “absolutely no fatigue” at 0 and “the worst possible fatigue imaginable”\nat 10 \n\nQOL was assessed via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Breast Cancer\n FACT-B  instrument  which provided an assessment of the patients’

chromatography\n HPLC  via a modification of the method reported by Hess et al 76 All sample-handling\nsteps were performed under subdued amber lighting  Patient plasma samples were collected\nfrom October 2004 to September 2009 and were stored at –80° C until they were analyzed \nCoQ10 is stable for several years when it is stored at –80° C 77 Prior to extraction  50 μL of\n25 μg/mL vitamin K

 The combined hexane extracts were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen  and then\nreconstituted with 200 μL of ethanol  Duplicate 35-μL injections were subjected to reverse-\nphase HPLC under the same conditions used for vitamin E  The column eluent was\nmonitored at 325 nm  vitamin K  and 270 nm  CoQ10 \n\nStatistical Considerations\nThe primary objective of this randomized trial was to assess the effect of CoQ10 on self-\nreported cancer treatment–related fatigue in breast cancer patients following 24 weeks of\ntherapy  Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of CoQ10 on overall QOL and\ndepression  Patients were stratified by planned radiation therapy  yes/no  and type of\nchemotherapy  anthracycline vs no anthracycline  and were assigned within strata to receive\nCoQ10 or a placebo with equal probability via variably sized permuted block randomization \nThe study was powered to detect a 30% relative difference in the POMS-F subscale  ie  9 9\nvs 6 9  between the 2 groups with 90% power at the 5% 2-sided level of significance  with\nassumptions of an adjusted standard deviation  SD  of 5 9 for the POMS-F subscale  and a\ndropout rate of approximately 40%  and an allowance for 1 interim look  The required\nsample size was 118 per group \n\nChi-square  Fisher exact  and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess baseline group\ndifferences in categorical and continuous variables  Repeated measures analysis of variance\n RM-ANOVA  was used to assess the effect of CoQ10 on each outcome over time  Models\nwere constrained to have equal group means at baseline  as proposed by Fitzmaurice et al 78\nThis approach gives the same estimate of treatment effect as does an RM-ANCOVA model\n ie  the baseline measure of the outcome is used as a covariate  when there are no missing\n\nLesser et al  Page 5\n\nJ Support Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 March 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

who have only baseline observations  which allows us to use more data \nVarious covariance structures were considered for each model  including unstructured \ncompound symmetry  autoregressive  and Toeplitz  and the Bayesian Information Criterion\nwas used to choose the most appropriate covariance structure for each outcome  Age  race \nbody mass index  BMI  and strata were included as covariates in separate models  The\nprimary interest was in the effect of CoQ10 at 24 weeks  and this effect was assessed by\nusing a linear contrast within the RM-ANOVA  The same modeling strategy was used to\nassess the effect of CoQ10 on the secondary outcome measures \n\nRESULTS\nIn all  236 patients were enrolled between August 2004 and March 2009  Figure 1  Baseline\ncharacteristics for all participants are summarized in Table 1  Ages ranged from 28 to 85\nyears  with a median of 51 years  Most patients were non-Hispanic whites  87%  2% were\nHispanic  and 11% were non-Hispanic blacks  Most patients were receiving anthracycline\nchemotherapy  84%  61% also received radiation therapy  In all  91% of the patients had an\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group  ECOG  performance status of 0  CoQ10 levels\nranged from 0 13 to 3 4 μg/mL  with a median of 0 67 μg/mL  44% of the patients had\nCoQ10 levels that were lower than normal  < 0 64 μg/mL  Patients reported low levels of\nfatigue at study initiation  Patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the\ntreatment groups \n\nCoQ10 and vitamin E plasma levels were measured at baseline and following 8  16  and 24\nweeks of therapy  These data are summarized in Figures 2 and 3 for all samples collected at\neach visit  On average  CoQ10 supplementation resulted in an approximate 3-fold increase\nin plasma levels of CoQ10  from a mean  SD  of 0 7  0 4  μg/mL at baseline to 2 2  1 2  μg/\nmL at 8 weeks  However  there was much variability in postrandomization levels  and\nseveral patients failed to have noticeable increases in their levels  the average posttreatment\nCoQ10 levels were lower than the baseline levels for 12% of the participants on the CoQ10\narm  All patients received vitamin E supplementation  and levels almost doubled from 13 8\n 8 7  μg/mL at baseline to 24 1  15 1  μg/mL at 8 weeks  Average posttreatment vitamin E\nlevels were lower than baseline levels for 11% of the participants \n\nThe primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of CoQ10 on patients’ self-\nreported fatigue levels at 24 weeks post randomization  Fatigue was quantified primarily by\nthe POMS-F subscale  The FACIT-F subscale and a LASA-Fatigue were also used to\nquantify fatigue  Higher values for the FACIT-F subscale and lower values for the POMS-F\nsubscale and the LASA-Fatigue indicate less fatigue  The raw fatigue measures over time\nare summarized in Table 2  and the least squares means adjusted for covariates are shown in\nTable 3  As expected  fatigue increased significantly with the onset of chemotherapy  P <  \n001  for patients in both groups  and gradually lessened thereafter  although never to\npretreatment levels  In comparison to the placebo arm  CoQ10 supplementation was not\nsignificantly associated with changes in any of the fatigue measures at 24 weeks or at any\ntime during this study  The interaction between baseline CoQ10 levels and treatment was\nnot significant and the interaction between baseline fatigue and treatment was not significant\nin separate RM-ANCOVA models indicating that the treatment effect did not differ\ndepending on initial fatigue or CoQ10 levels  Separate models that were examined for the\nsubgroup of patients whose CoQ10 levels were below normal at baseline also failed to show\nany treatment benefit for CoQ10  as did models that were run on the patients in the lowest\nquartile of fatigue  worst fatigue  at baseline  We also examined the treatment effect in\npatients who were

group of patients \n\nAs expected  patients in both treatment groups experienced decreases in their overall QOL\n P <  001  as seen in Table 4  Treatment with CoQ10  however  did not significantly\nimprove the patients’ QOL at 24 weeks  as measured by the FACT-B total score  P =  764\noverall  P =  577 at 24 weeks  Nonsignificant increases in depressive symptoms after the\ninitiation of adjuvant therapy were noted  and these symptoms were also not significantly\ndifferent between the CoQ10 and the placebo groups  P =  697 overall  P =  632 at 24\nweeks \n\nGrade 3 and 4 toxicities that were experienced by patients in this trial are summarized in\nTable 5  No severe drug-related toxicity was assessed as possibly  probably  or definitely\nattributed to CoQ10  CoQ10 and placebo patients did not differ significantly in the incidence\nof grade 3 and 4 toxicities  P =  301  or any toxicity  all grades   P =  430 \n\nDISCUSSION\nThe primary aim of this randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial was to determine\nthe effect of CoQ10 supplementation on self-reported fatigue in women who had breast\ncancer and were beginning adjuvant chemotherapy  Despite a host of clinical trials \nrelatively few pharmacologic interventions for cancer-related fatigue have been effective \nErythropoiesis-stimulating agents have improved fatigue in a number of prospective \nrandomized  phase III clinical trials of anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy79 \nhowever  recent concerns over tumor stimulation and decreased survival following the use\nof these agents have significantly curtailed their use  A subset of patients who had more\nsevere fatigue and/or advanced disease benefited somewhat from treatment with the\npsychostimulant methylphenidate in a phase III trial reported by Moraska et al 80 although\nno benefit was seen in the study population as a whole  Similar results were seen in more\nthan 800 patients who were treated on a phase III trial of modafinil  a nonamphetamine\npsychostimulant  in which only those patients with severe baseline fatigue seemed to\nbenefit 81 82\n\nIn this trial  despite serologic evidence of an average 3-fold increase in CoQ10 levels in\nwomen on the treatment arm  no difference in fatigue between CoQ10 supplemented and\nplacebo-treated patients was seen according to 3 separate  validated measures  This was true\nfor the patients with below-normal CoQ10 levels at baseline and for patients with worse\nfatigue at baseline  subgroups that might be more likely to benefit from CoQ10\nsupplementation  The fatigue trajectory seen in these patients  ie  fatigue that worsened with\ntreatment and only gradually returned toward baseline after almost 6 months  mirrors the\nobservations seen in previously published trials of fatigue in newly diagnosed women with\nbreast cancer  Although not efficacious  CoQ10 supplementation was devoid of significant\ntoxicity  adverse events seen in these patients represented the side effects of chemotherapy\nwith or without radiation therapy \n\nOne reason for the widespread use of CoQ10 supplementation by patients with breast and\nother cancers has been to correct a perceived CoQ10 deficiency that is thought to predispose\npatients to an increase in treatment-related toxicity  CoQ10 deficiency has been described in\na cohort of 200 women who were hospitalized for breast surgery for both malignant and\nnonmalignant lesions 83 In our study  CoQ10 levels at baseline were below the lower limit\nof normal38-40  84 for approximately 44% of enrolled women  Supplementation with\nstandard doses of CoQ10 led to a significant and sustained increase in plasma CoQ10 levels\nin treated patients on this trial  Although a variety of factors can influence plasma CoQ10\n\nLesser et al  Page 7\n\nJ Support Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 March 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

seen in treated women on this trial mirror\nthose described in other patient populations that were supplemented with similar amounts of\nCoQ10 39-41 84\n\nThis trial did not address the benefits  if any  of CoQ10 dose escalation  The safety of\nescalated doses of CoQ10 has been evaluated in a randomized  placebo-controlled trial in\npatients with early Parkinson's disease  A total of 80 patients received doses of 300 mg to\n1 200 mg per day of CoQ10 for up to 16 months  and there was no difference in the\nincidence of drug-related toxicities between the placebo and treatment arms 41 Doses of up\nto 3 000 mg/day for up to 8 months have also been well tolerated in cohorts of patients with\nParkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 85 86 Although treated patients in all of\nthese trials experienced a low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects  including nausea \nvomiting  diarrhea  and abdominal discomfort  these symptoms did not appear to be dose\nrelated  and they occurred at identical rates in both treatment and placebo arms 41 47 87 88 In\nthis trial  dose escalation of CoQ10 was not attempted  However  no evidence of an\nimprovement in fatigue was seen in the patients with the highest sustained levels of CoQ10\nfollowing supplementation  100% increase or more  Although this result does not rule out a\npossible benefit of higher doses  it provides no suggestion of a “dose response” in the\npopulation of women enrolled in this trial \n\nA large number of patients dropped out of this study before the 24-week study end point \nHowever  the causes for study discontinuation were not different between the 2 treatment\narms  Of the 97 patients who withdrew before the scheduled final study assessment  21% did\nso for toxicities related to their primary anticancer therapy  Another 41% of these patients\ndiscontinued therapy following prolonged periods of inability to reliably tolerate oral\nmedications  Again  this was primarily related to treatment-induced toxicities  particularly\nhospitalization  nausea  and/or vomiting  as well as an unwillingness to comply with a 3-\ntimes-a-day dosing regimen of study medications in the face of a perceived daunting\nschedule of antitumor therapy  In light of this dropout rate  we also analyzed all primary and\nsecondary end points at the interim 8- and 16-week time points  This analysis again failed to\nreveal any indication of a CoQ10 effect on fatigue  depression  and QOL \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on our data  there is no evidence to support the use of standard-dose CoQ10\nsupplementation to ameliorate treatment-related fatigue in newly diagnosed women with\nbreast cancer  Although fatigued patients without breast cancer were not specifically\nincluded in this study  there are no compelling mechanistic data to suggest that these patients\nwould respond differently to CoQ10  In addition  this study was designed to limit and/or\nprevent fatigue among patients who were initiating adjuvant therapy  It was not targeted\ntoward already-fatigued patients to try to reduce their symptoms  Given the results of this\nstudy  however  it does not seem likely that using CoQ10 supplementation to target fatigued\npatients would result in better outcomes \n\nEvaluation of dose-escalated CoQ10 could be attempted  with an expectation of higher\nsteady-state plasma CoQ10 levels  However  the absence of any suggested benefit for the\nsupplement in any of the patient subgroups examined in this trial indicates that newer\napproaches utilizing conventional or complementary agents would probably be a better use\nof limited clinical research resources \n\nLesser et al  Page 8\n\nJ Support Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2014 March 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

detection rate is a benchmark measure of screening \nmammography quality  but its computation requires linkage of mammography interpretive \nperformance information with cancer incidence data  A Medicare claims-based measure of \ndetected breast cancers could simplify measurement of this benchmark and facilitate \nmammography quality assessment and research \n\nObjectives—To validate a claims-based algorithm that can identify with high positive predictive \nvalue  PPV  incident breast cancers that were detected at screening mammography \nResearch Design—Development of a claims-derived algorithm using classification and \nregression tree analyses within a random half-sample of Medicare screening mammography \nclaims followed by validation of the algoritm in the remaining half-sample using clinical data on \nmammography results and cancer incidence from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium \n BCSC \nSubjects—Female fee-for-service Medicare enrollees age 68 years and older who underwent \nscreening mammography from 2001 to 2005 within BCSC registries in four states  CA  NC  NH  \nand VT  enabling linkage of claims and BCSC mammography data  N=233 044 mammograms \nobtained by 104 997 women \nMeasures—Sensitivity  specificity  and PPV of algorithmic identification of incident breast \ncancers that were detected by radiologists relative to a reference standard based on BCSC \nmammography and cancer incidence data \n\nResults—An algorithm based on subsequent codes for breast cancer diagnoses and treatments \nand follow-up mammography identified incident screen-detected breast cancers with 92 9% \nsensitivity  95% CI  91 0%-94 8%  99 9% specificity  95% CI  99 9%-99 9%  and a PPV of \n88 0%  95% CI  85 7%-90 4% \nConclusions—A simple claims-based algorithm can accurately identify incident breast cancers \ndetected at screening mammography among Medicare enrollees  The algorithm may enable \nmammography quality assessment using Medicare claims alone \n\nKeywords\nBreast Cancer Screening  Mammography  Validation Studies  Medicare  Quality Assessment\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCore measures of mammography performance  such as recall rates and breast cancer \ndetection rates  vary widely across U S  radiologists and mammography facilities  1  In \naddition  despite an average recall rate in the U S  that is nearly twice that of most European \nnations  breast cancer detection rates after screening mammography are no higher in the \n\nFenton et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01

mammography services \n\nOne issue may be differences in radiologist mammography experience and annual \ninterpretive volume in the U S  vs  European countries  3  and some have suggested \nbenchmarks for screening mammography performance as a means of prompting radiologist- \nor facility-level efforts to improve interpretation  4  5  The Institute of Medicine has also \nemphasized the need for high quality measures of provider- and facility-level performance \nto guide targeted quality improvement efforts  6  The U S  Medicare program has a \nparticularly large stake in mammography quality improvement  Medicare pays for over 8 5 \nmillion mammograms each year at a cost of over $1 billion annually  7  and over half of \nincident breast cancers occur among women older than 65 years  8  Currently  Medicare \nreports facility-level performance of follow-up or recall rates as part of the Hospital Quality \nReporting Program  However  additional valid and reliable performance measures are \nneeded to facilitate broader scale improvement \n\nMedicare claims data are one potential data source for measuring mammography \ninterpretative performance  The breast cancer detection rate  for example  is a widely used \nmeasure of radiologist- and facility-level interpretive performance  a cancer detection rate of \n2 5 breast cancers per 1000 screening mammograms is considered a minimally acceptable \nperformance level  5  This measure  however  is challenging to implement  because it \nrequires accurate identification of  1  screening mammograms  2  subsequent incident breast \ncancers  and 3  screening mammography interpretation  With regard to identifying screening \nmammograms using Medicare data  we recently validated a claims-based algorithm for \ndistinguishing screening from diagnostic mammograms  9  The distinction between \nscreening and diagnostic is critical  because the incidence of breast cancer is much higher \nfollowing diagnostic than screening mammography  4  10  However  with regard to the \nsecond step  there has been uncertainty about the accuracy of claims for identifying incident \n rather than prevalent  breast cancers  11  12  Diagnosis codes for breast cancer are not \nspecific for incident rather than prevalent disease  and procedure codes for breast cancer \ntreatments  such as mastectomy  can occur when women are treated for either benign \nconditions or recurrent breast cancer  Finally  claims provide no direct information to infer \nwhether mammograms were interpreted as normal or abnormal  potentially limiting the \nability to infer that incident cancers were detected at screening mammography \n\nNattinger et al  previously validated a clinically informed  four-step algorithm for \ndistinguishing incident from prevalent breast cancers using Medicare claims data  13  \nRelative to a reference standard based on Surveillance  Epidemiology  and End Results \n SEER  cancer registry data  the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of ~80% and a positive \npredictive value of over 90%  However  the algorithm was not validated in a cohort \nundergoing screening mammography  so it is uncertain if the algorithm accurately identifies \nbreast cancers in a screening population  nor does the algorithm address screening \nmammography interpretation  Additionally  the algorithm was validated using data from \n1994  and it is uncertain if it achieves similar performance with more recent Medicare \nclaims \n\nFenton et al  Page 3\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01

Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium with Medicare claims to evaluate the \nperformance of claims-based methods for identifying incident breast cancer that followed \npositive screening mammography  We first assessed the performance the approach described \nby Nattinger et al   13  within a screening mammography cohort   Henceforth  we refer to \nthis as the Nattinger algorithm  We then assessed whether classification and regression tree \nanalyses could identify an alternative approach with improved performance  We \nhypothesized that claims-derived algorithms could identify incident cancers following true-\npositive screening mammography with high predictive value in recent Medicare claims \n\nMETHODS\nData\n\nWe used data from Medicare claims files  the Carrier Claims  Outpatient  and Inpatient files  \nand the Medicare denominator file  which provides demographic  enrollment  and vital \nstatus data  While Medicare mammography claims typically appear in the Carrier file  we \nassessed both the Carrier and Outpatient files to capture the minority of claims present only \nin the Outpatient file  ~3%   14  We used Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System \n HCPCS  procedure codes to identify bilateral mammograms and procedures occurring \nbefore and after mammography  Medicare claims also include International Classification of \nDiseases  9th Edition  Clinical Modification  ICD-9-CM  diagnosis codes  which we used to \nidentify breast cancer diagnosis codes and breast symptoms \n\nMedicare claims from 1998 to 2006 were linked with BCSC mammography data derived \nfrom regional mammography registries in four states  North Carolina  San Francisco Bay \nArea  CA  New Hampshire  and Vermont   http //breastscreening cancer gov/  Claims and \nBCSC mammography data were matched using a deterministic algorithm derived by the \nNational Center for Health Statistics that is based on social security numbers  when \navailable  names  and birthdates  Among women aged 65 years and older with a BCSC \nmammogram between 1998 and 2006  87% were successfully matched to Medicare claims  \nWomen who did not successfully match typically received mammography at facilities that \ndid not report social security numbers to the BCSC \n\nBCSC facilities transmit prospectively collected patient and mammography data to regional \nregistries  which link the data to breast cancer outcomes ascertained from regional or \nstatewide cancer registries and pathology data  Data are pooled at a central Statistical \nCoordinating Center  SCC  BCSC mammography data include information on examination \npurpose  screening vs  diagnostic  radiologist interpretation  and patient socio-\ndemographics and breast health history  The BCSC has established standard definitions for \nkey variables and multiple levels of data quality control and monitoring  15  Each registry \nand the SCC have received institutional review board approval for either active or passive \nconsenting processes or a waiver of consent to enroll participants  link data  and perform \nanalytic studies  All procedures are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n HIPAA  compliant and all registries and the SCC have received a Federal Certificate of \nConfidentiality to protect the identities of patients  physicians  and facilities

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\n\nSubjects\nWe identified mammograms captured in both Medicare claims and the BCSC among \nwomen who were aged 68 or older on mammography dates from January 1  2001 to \nDecember 31  2005  We identified screening mammograms  distinguishing them from \ndiagnostic mammograms  using a validated claims-based algorithm based upon the HCPCS \nmammogram codes  claims for mammography in the prior nine months  and claims with \nICD-9-CM codes for breast cancer during the year prior to mammography  9  Relative to a \nBCSC-derived reference standard  the positive predictive value of the algorithm’s screening \ndesignation was ~95%  We used the claims-based algorithm  rather than BCSC data  to \nidentify screening mammograms so that results would be potentially generalizable to other \nMedicare claims-based studies where linkage of claims to mammography registry data is not \nfeasible \n\nWe selected mammograms for women with continuous enrollment in fee-for-service \nMedicare  parts A and B  for twelve months after mammography and three years prior to \nmammography  enabling both prospective assessment of outpatient claims for clinical events \nthat might indicate incident breast cancer following abnormal screening mammography  and \nretrospective assessment for claims indicating prevalent breast cancer  Hence  we excluded \nwomen aged 65 to 68 years because only women aged 68 years or greater consistently have \nthree years of prior claims  Following Nattinger  et al   13  we considered a woman to have \nprevalent cancer if any ICD-9-CM codes for invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-\nsitu appeared on claims in the three years prior to mammography  see Table  Supplemental \nDigital Content 1  which gives claims and diagnostic codes used in developing study \nvariables  Although some women with prevalent breast cancer continue to receive \nscreening mammography  we excluded these mammograms so that our sample represented \nwomen undergoing screening who had no breast cancer in the prior three years  We \nrandomly divided the sample into two half-samples  one for training and one for validation \nof classification and regression tree  CART  analyses \n\nReference Standard\nWe used BCSC cancer registry data to identify incident breast cancers and BCSC \nmammography data to identify radiologists’ mammography interpretation  We defined \nincident breast cancers as those with a diagnosis date within one year of the date of \nscreening mammography  Following standard BCSC definitions  available at  http //\nbreastscreening cancer gov/data/bcsc_data_definitions pdf  a positive mammogram was \ndefined as one with a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System  BI-RADS®  assessment \nof 0  needs additional imaging evaluation  3  probably benign finding  with a \nrecommendation for immediate follow-up  4  suspicious abnormality  or 5  highly \nsuggestive of malignancy 16  Mammograms with other BI-RADS® assessments were \ndefined as negative  because no immediate evaluation was recommended at the time of \nscreening mammography  A screen-detected breast cancer was defined as a positive \nmammogram with a diagnosis of incident breast cancer within one year \n\nFenton et al  Page 5\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\n\n\nClaims-Based Algorithms for Identifying Incident Screen-Detected Breast Cancers\nWe first adapted the Nattinger algorithm to identify incident breast cancers during the one \nyear following screening mammography  13  The Nattinger algorithm begins by identifying \n“high-probability” cases based on codes for breast cancer diagnoses and therapies during the \nyear following the index date  in this instance  the date of mammography  Next  the \nalgorithm attempts to exclude women treated for benign breast disease  cancers that were \nmetastatic to the breast  and  finally  women with prevalent breast cancer based on breast \ncancer diagnosis codes occurring during three years of claims prior to the index date  We \nclassified all cases identified by the algorithm as screen-detected incident cancers  Although \nwe recognize that the Nattinger algorithm was not designed to consider mammography \ninterpretation  we felt that it was valuable to evaluate its performance in the context of \nrecent screening mammography \n\nWe then conducted CART analyses in attempts to identify an algorithm with improved \nperformance  17  CART is a non-parametric decision tree methodology that identifies \nsequential binary partitions in independent variables to optimize prediction of the dependent \nvariable  in this case  incident breast cancer detected at screening mammography  A \npotential advantage is that CART can specify the best-performing time intervals following \nmammography for ascertaining breast cancer diagnosis or treatment codes following \nincident breast cancers that were detected at mammography \n\nPotential independent variables for CART analyses were derived from claims on the \nmammogram date or during a one-year post-mammogram follow-up  including  patient age  \ndays to any subsequent mammogram  days to diagnosis codes for breast cancer  ductal \ncarcinoma in-situ  benign breast tumors  secondary cancers of the breast  or a personal \nhistory of breast cancer  days to procedural or diagnostic codes for breast biopsies  days to \nany procedural codes for breast-directed surgery  lumpectomy  partial mastectomy  or \nmastectomy  axillary lymph node biopsy or resections  and days to any codes for breast \nradiation  18  19   See Table  Supplemental Digital Content 1  for claims and diagnostic \ncodes used in developing study variables \n\nWe performed CART analyses on the training half-sample of mammograms  The CART \nalgorithm selected splits in independent variables on the basis of the Gini index  and \ncontinued growing the tree until no further splits improved the Gini index by more than \n0 0001  17  To minimize over-fitting  we pruned the tree to optimal complexity based on \ncross-validation \n\nAnalyses of Classification Accuracy\nWithin the validation sub-sample  we created cross-tabulations to compare the identification \nof incident screen-detected breast cancers using claims-based algorithms versus the \nreference standard  We quantified accuracy using  sensitivity  the proportion of incident \nscreen-detected cancers that were identified by the algorithm  specificity  the proportion of \nmammograms without incident screen-detected cancers that were so classified by the \nalgorithm  positive predictive value  PPV  or the proportion of algorithmically-identified \nincident screen-detected cancers that were also classified as such by the reference standard  \n\nFenton et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nand negative predictive value  the proportion of mammograms classified as having no \nincident screen-detected cancer also classified as having no incident screen-detected cancer \nby the reference standard  As a practical test of the algorithm’s accuracy  we compared \nunadjusted relative rates of breast cancer detection as computed using the CART algorithm \nand BCSC data  i e  the reference standard  within subgroups based on age  race/ethnicity  \nnon-urban vs  urban residence  and Medicaid eligibility  A woman was classified as \nMedicaid eligible if the Medicare denominator file indicated at least one month of Medicaid \neligibility in the three years before or one year after the index mammogram  Non-urban vs  \nurban residence was determined using the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Code for the zip \ncode of the woman’s primary residence  We computed 95% confidence intervals around all \npoint estimates  We performed statistical analyses using the rpart package in R  version \n2 12 0  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Vienna  Austria \n\nRESULTS\nMammogram Samples\n\nWe identified a sample of 233 044 screening mammograms with linked Medicare claims \nand BCSC records  The mammograms were obtained by 104 997 women who received an \naverage of 2 2 mammograms during the study period  range  1-7  On the date of \nmammography  women had a mean age of 75 2 years  SD  5 3  range 68 to 104  Based on \nBCSC interpretation and cancer data  radiologists detected breast cancer on 1 384 of the \nmammograms  the breast cancer detection rate in the sample was 5 9 cancers per 1000 \nscreening mammograms  The patient sample was ethnically diverse with substantial \nrepresentation in both non-urban and urban settings  Table 1 \n\nPerformance of Claims-Based Algorithms\nUsing CART analyses  we identified a claims-based algorithm that classified women based \non whether breast cancers were detected as screening mammography  Figure 1  Assessing \nclaims for one year following screening mammography  the algorithm classifies a \nmammogram as having detected breast cancer if there is a claim diagnosis code for breast \ncancer within 123 days and any claim for breast-directed surgery within one year  \nAlternatively  if there is no claim diagnosis code for breast cancer within 123 days  the \nalgorithm classifies a mammogram as having detected incident breast cancer if there is a \nclaim diagnosis code for ductal carcinoma in-situ within 286 days and a claim for another \nmammogram within 82 days  The algorithm classifies all other mammograms as not \ndetecting incident breast cancer   See Supplemental Digital Content 2 for programming code \nfor implementing the algorithm in R \n\nWe compared the performance of the Nattinger algorithm and the CART-derived algorithm \nin identifying incident breast cancer detected at screening mammography  Table 2  While \nthe Nattinger algorithm had a sensitivity of 83 75%  a specificity 99 86%  and a PPV of \n77 45%  the CART-dervived algorithm had a sensitivity of 92 89% and slightly higher \nspecificity  99 93%  Although small  this difference results in fewer cases falsely classified \nas detected breast cancers using the CART-derived algorithm as compared to the Nattinger \nalgorithm and a higher PPV  88 03% vs  77 45%   \n\nFenton et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIn analyses stratified by age  race/ethnicity  Medicaid eligibility  and non-urban vs  urban \nresidence  estimates of relative rates of incident detected breast cancer using the algorithm \nwere similar to reference standard estimates based on BCSC data  Table 3 \n\nDISCUSSION\nIn a sample of screening mammograms with corresponding Medicare claims and \nmammography registry data  a claims-based algorithm identified screening mammograms \nwith detected incident breast cancers with a sensitivity greater than 90%  a specificity over \n99 9%  and a PPV of 88%  Algorithm performance was generally similar across population \nsubgroups and enabled accurate estimates of between-group relative rates of incident breast \ncancer detection \n\nBoth the CART-derived algorithm and the algorithm proposed by Nattinger  et al  had very \nhigh specificities compared to the BCSC-derived reference standard  13  A high specificity \nis crucial for a cancer detection algorithm  With a rare outcome such as breast cancer  even a \nslight decrement in specificity could markedly diminish the measure’s PPV  as the number \nof false-positives may quickly accumulate in comparison to the number of true-positives  \nNevertheless  sensitivity is also important to PPV  In this screening mammography cohort  \nthe PPV of the CART approach  88 0%  exceeded that of the Nattinger approach  77 5%  \ndue to a combination of slightly higher specificity and higher sensitivity  93 9% vs  83 7% \n\nThe PPV of 88 0% for the CART approach implies that approximately 1 of 9 cancers \nidentified by the algorithm as incident detected breast cancers are wrongly identified as \nsuch  In the validation set  this included 87 cases  of a total 116 522 mammograms  As \nshown in Figure 1  most of these false-positives occurred among women with breast cancer \ndiagnosis codes within 123 days and breast-directed surgery within one year of screening \nmammography  Using BCSC data  we found that ~36%  n=31  of these women had interval \nbreast cancers that were not detected at screening mammography yet were diagnosed \nclinically within 365 days of screening  Additionally  we found that a small fraction of \nexams  <13%  had breast cancer diagnosis codes on claims but ultimately had benign biopsy \nresults  providers for these women may have used breast cancer diagnosis codes while \n“ruling out” breast cancer   Specific numbers suppressed to protect subject confidentiality  \nDespite exclusion of mammograms for women with breast cancer diagnosis codes on claims \nduring the three prior years  a small fraction of mammograms  <13%  were performed on \nwomen with prevalent breast cancers based on BCSC data and who received breast-directed \nsurgery during the year following screening mammography  conceivably for local \nrecurrences \n\nMeanwhile  the algorithm did not identify 7 1% of women whose breast cancers were truly \ndetected at mammography  49 of 689 detected incident cancers in the validation set  As \nshown in Figure 1  many of these women may have had delays in the appearance of \ndiagnostic codes for invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-situ or delays in receipt of \neither breast-directed surgery or subsequent mammography  Nattinger et al  similarly found \nthat a small fraction of women with incident breast cancer according to SEER data did not \n\nFenton et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nreceive breast cancer surgery  these women were more likely than women who received \nsurgery to lack breast cancer diagnostic codes in Medicare claims  13 \n\nWe recognize that cut-points in the CART algorithm may seem arbitrary  such as the initial \nnode in which a breast cancer diagnosis code is assessed as occurring within 123 days of \nscreening mammography  While there is no clinical justification for this cut-point  it yields \nthe optimal classification of cases as assessed by the Gini index and validated in a testing \nsub-sample  Thus  a shorter or longer cut-point would compromise overall classification \naccuracy  most likely with degradation in PPV  At the same time  we believe the general \nstructure and flow of the decision tree is clinically intuitive as one would expect diagnosis \ncodes for breast cancer with subsequent procedure codes for treatment to be reliable \npredictors of incident breast cancer  The assessment for procedure codes for subsequent \nmammography among women with diagnosis codes for ductal carcinoma in-situ is perhaps \nless intuitive  although most women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in-situ will \nindeed receive diagnostic mammography within 82 days of screening mammography \n\nSeveral potential uses of the CART algorithm are conceivable  First  the algorithm may be \nuseful in claims-based studies of screening mammography outcomes  including studies of \nnew screening technologies  such as digital mammography or computer-aided detection  on \nincident breast cancer detection  Because the algorithm does not require linkage with cancer \nregistry data  investigators may apply it in unlinked Medicare claims  enabling sample sizes \nthat would not be achievable with linked data such as the SEER-Medicare data  Second  the \nalgorithm could conceivably enable claims-based estimation of radiologist- or facility-level \nquality metrics  specifically breast cancer detection rates  facilitating quality improvement \nefforts in mammography among Medicare enrollees  We recognize that the algorithm’s PPV \nof ~88% does not confer certainty regarding a provider’s true-positive interpretation  The \nalgorithm may nevertheless allow identification of provider’s with extremely low breast \ncancer detection rates  In any application  investigators must carefully consider potential \nimpacts of algorithmic misclassification on study results and plan suitable sensitivity \nanalyses \n\nAlthough BCSC data on whether breast cancers were detected at mammography may be \nimperfect  leading to inaccuracy in the reference standard  the BCSC mammography data \nundergo rigorous quality control and are linked with high-quality regional cancer registries  \nOur results also derive from mammography claims of fee-for-service Medicare enrollees \nwithin four U S  regional mammography registries  Algorithms may not generalize to non-\nMedicare claims or to Medicare enrollees outside these regions  Because study algorithms \nrequire three years of prior claims to exclude prevalent breast cancers  their validity among \nwomen younger than age 68 years is uncertain  We also recognize that CART analyses may \nbe prone to over-fitting  Nevertheless  our analysis included variables that are clinically \nmeaningful  and we cross-validated the CART-derived algorithm within the training sample  \nWe also pruned the tree based on theory and practice  and the final tree was highly \npredictive in the test sample  Finally  in late 2014  Medicare will transition from ICD-9 to \nICD-10 coding  While the mapping of the algorithm’s breast cancer diagnosis and procedure \ncodes should be unambiguous  the performance of the algorithm would ideally be re-\nevaluated after the transition to ICD-10 \n\nFenton et al  Page 9\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nStudy strengths include the inclusion of large mammography claim samples from \ngeographically diverse settings that were linked with high-quality external mammography \ndata  yielding rigorous validation analyses with excellent precision  Because cancer \nregistries such as SEER encompass only 25% of the U S  population  20  the alternative \nalgorithms may enable mammogram sampling for research or quality improvement across \nthe entire Medicare program regardless of claims linkage with cancer registry data \n\nWe found that a simple  Medicare claims-based algorithm can identify with high predictive \nvalue women with incident breast cancers following a positive screening mammogram  \nApplied to Medicare claims alone without cancer registry linkage  the algorithm may be \nuseful in claims-based studies of screening mammography  The potential for using the \nalgorithm in provider-level quality assessment warrants evaluation \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFunding

\n\nAbstract\nBackground—A substantial proportion of cancer-related mortality is attributable to recurrent \nnot de novo metastatic disease  yet we know relatively little about these patients  To fill this gap \ninvestigators often use administrative codes for secondary malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy to\nidentify recurrent cases in population-based datasets  However  these algorithms have not been\nvalidated in large  contemporary  routine care cohorts \n\nObjective—To evaluate the validity of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes\nas indicators of recurrence after definitive local therapy for stage I-III lung  colorectal  breast  and\nprostate cancer \n\nResearch Design  Subjects & Measures—We assessed the sensitivity  specificity  and\npositive predictive value  PPV  of these codes 14- and 60-months after diagnosis using two\nadministrative datasets linked with gold-standard recurrence status information  CanCORS/\nMedicare  diagnoses 2003-2005  and HMO/Cancer Research Network  diagnoses 2000-2005 \nResults—We identified 929 CanCORS/Medicare patients and 5298 HMO/CRN patients \nSensitivity  specificity  and PPV ranged widely depending on which codes were

code-set offered even moderate\nsensitivity  ≤19% \nConclusions—Secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes could not identify\nrecurrent cancer without some risk of misclassification  Findings based on existing algorithms\nshould be interpreted with caution  More work is needed to develop a valid algorithm that can be\nused to characterize outcomes and define patient cohorts for comparative effectiveness research\nstudies \n\nIntroduction\nCancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States  accounting for\napproximately 600 000 lives lost per year 1 While some cancer deaths are attributable to\nprogression of the primary disease  many  if not the majority  are due to recurrent metastatic\ncancer that develops among patients who previously completed definitive therapy and were\ndeclared disease free 2 Patients with recurrent metastatic cancer may differ significantly\nfrom those with primary metastatic cancer  because they previously received cancer-directed\ntherapy  have co-morbid medical conditions from their prior disease or treatment  have a\ndifferent distribution or extent of disease  or have different goals and values  Reliably\nidentifying patients with recurrent cancer would facilitate efforts to compare the\neffectiveness of treatments given at the time of recurrence and would permit the use of\nrecurrence-free-survival as an outcome in comparative effectiveness research studies \n\nTumor registries generate extensive information about patients with de novo metastatic\ndisease  but they cannot do as much to illuminate the experiences of patients with recurrent\nmetastatic disease because they do not have robust mechanisms for identifying recurrence \nSome tumor registries  such as those available from SEER  Surveillance  Epidemiology and\nEnd Results  and the Cancer Research Network  CRN  have been linked with\nadministrative data and used to assess cancer patients’ patterns-of-care and outcomes 3-9\n\nBelieving that these large  longitudinal  population-based datasets could also provide\nvaluable information about recurrent cancer  investigators have developed algorithms that\nuse the administrative codes for secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy to\nidentify patients with recurrent disease  While a number of studies have used these codes to\nindicate which patients have recurrent cancer10-13  few have assessed their validity as\npotential indicators of recurrence \n\nIn a 2002 study of 89 acute myeloid leukemia patients treated at a large cancer center  Earle\nand colleagues14 assessed the ability of inpatient procedure codes for the administration of\nchemotherapy to identify relapse after a treatment gap of at least four months  N=22\npatients  The algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 86%  a specificity of 99%  and a PPV of\n95%  In a study of 45 patients with node-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant\nchemotherapy as part of a clinical trial  Lamont and colleagues15 tested the ability of\nsecondary malignant neoplasm codes to identify disease-free survival  N=12 patients  At\nfive years of follow up  the algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97% \nwith an area under the receiver operator characteristic  ROC  curve of 0 97 \n\nHassett et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available

patients with specific cancer types  The\nvalidity of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes in less selected cohorts\nand across multiple cancer types remains uncertain  Our goal was to test and validate these\ntwo previously published recurrence detection algorithms using two larger  more\nrepresentative samples  Further evaluation of the methods currently being used to identify\npatients who have recurrent cancer is needed to ensure that our beliefs about this population\nare accurate  If administrative data fail to identify all patients who truly have recurrence or\ninappropriately classify patients as having recurrence the resulting misclassification could\nlead to erroneous conclusions \n\nMethods\nPotential Indicators of Recurrence\n\nThe codes that we tested as potential indicators of cancer recurrence included the secondary\nmalignant neoplasm codes described by Lamont and colleagues15 and the chemotherapy\ncodes described by Earle and colleagues14  The secondary malignant neoplasm codes\nincluded the International Classification of Diseases-Version 9-Clinical Modification\n ICD-9-CM  diagnosis codes for disease involving specific organ sites  i e  197-198 82 15\nAs described by Lamont and colleagues  the code for secondary malignant neoplasm at the\nsite of the original cancer was excluded as an indicator of recurrence  e g  when looking for\nrecurrence after a lung cancer diagnosis  the code for secondary malignant neoplasm of the\nlung [197 0] was excluded  because we could not determine whether it referred to recurrent\ndisease  the original caner  or a new primary  Also similar to the previous study  we\nconducted a sensitivity analysis in which we evaluated the impact of adding the secondary\nmalignant neoplasm codes for lymph nodes and other non-specific sites  i e  196 and\n198 89  to see if they improved sensitivity  The chemotherapy codes included generic\ncodes for the administration of anti-cancer agents and specific codes for cytotoxic and\ntargeted medications commonly used to treat cancer  Similar to the algorithm described by\nEarle and colleagues14  we included ICD-9-CM  Current Procedure Terminology  CPT \nHealthcare Common Procedure Coding System  HCPCS  Diagnosis-Related Groups\n DRG  revenue center  and Berenson-Eggers Type of Service  BETOS  codes [see Table \nSupplemental Digital Content 1  which provides a complete list of all codes used]  To\nimprove sensitivity  we added National Drug Codes  NDC  and to improve specificity we\nexcluded hormonal therapy medications  because they are frequently used as part of\nprolonged adjuvant therapy or for non-oncologic indications  and some chemotherapy\nmedications that are rarely used to treat recurrent cancer  e g  topical 5-fluorouracil  To\navoid the chance that chemotherapy given for adjuvant purposes would be construed as\nindicative of recurrence  we excluded chemotherapy occurring within 6 months of the index\ndiagnosis for lung cancer and within 12 months for breast and colorectal cancer  These\n“blackout” periods were based on the duration of standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens\nand a review of contemporary patterns-of-care  Finally  we assessed the performance\ncharacteristics of the two code-sets combined  i e  either secondary malignant neoplasm or\nchemotherapy codes \n\nHassett et al  Page 3\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 October 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nData Sources\nWe assessed the validity of these codes using two datasets that linked administrative codes \nwhich provided potential indicators of recurrence  with information abstracted from the\nmedical record  which provided gold standard recurrence status  One dataset contained\npatients cared for in a fee-for-service setting  CanCORS/Medicare  and the other contained\npatients cared for in a health maintenance organization-based Cancer Research Network\n HMO/CRN  We hypothesized that a code-based algorithm would be a more sensitive\nindicator of recurrence when applied to the fee-for-service versus the capitation\nenvironment \n\nCanCORS/Medicare—The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance\n CanCORS  Consortium is a large  prospective  population and health-system based study of\nthe care provided to and outcomes experienced by patients from across the United States\nwith lung and colorectal cancer diagnosed 2003-2005  The CanCORS dataset includes\ninformation from surveys of patients or their surrogates  and from the abstraction of\npatients’ medical records  Details of the study design  population  and data collection\nprocedures have been described elsewhere 16 After obtaining institutional review board\npermission  and with the consent of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nCanCORS records were linked with Medicare claim files from 2002-2007  The Dana-\nFarber/Harvard Cancer Center institutional review board provided oversight for the\nCanCORS/Medicare portion of this project \n\nHMO/CRN—The CRN is a consortium of 14 health care organizations affiliated with the\nHMO Research Network and the National Cancer Institute  http //crn cancer gov/  The\nCRN's Virtual Data Warehouse  VDW  was the primary data source for this analysis \nDescribed in detail elsewhere17 18  the VDW is a distributed data system using standard data\nformats and definitions where each HMO retains local control of its data  but a central\nprogrammer can direct extraction and analysis of data across all participating sites  It\nincludes data on patient demographics  health plan enrollment  SEER-compatible tumor\ncharacteristics  and cancer treatments  For this analysis  we used data from the two\nHMO/CRN sites that have “in-house” tumor registries staffed by certified tumor registrars\nwho collect high quality data regarding recurrence status  Both sites  Kaiser Permanente\nColorado  KPCO  Denver  CO and Kaiser Permanente Northwest  KPNW  Portland  OR \nprovide comprehensive health services through closed panel delivery models with salaried\nphysicians  Institutional review boards from both participating CRN sites approved this\nproject \n\nStudy Populations & Data Extraction\nFor both datasets we identified patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III lung  colorectal \nbreast  and prostate cancer  Patients with locally advanced or primarily progressive disease\nand those who did not complete definitive local-regional therapy were excluded  because we\nwanted to focus on patients for whom recurrence detection would be relatively easy  i e  we\nonly wanted to test the validity of these codes in situations that maximized their potential\nsensitivity and specificity  So  patients with stage IIIb lung cancer  those who did not have\ndefinitive local-regional therapy within 12 months of their index cancer diagnosis  and those\n\nHassett et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 October 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

abstraction data  those who had unknown recurrence status  and those who had\ndocumentation of recurrent disease in the medical record before they had definitive local\ntherapy were also excluded  Patients with no documented recurrence who died from causes\nother than cancer were considered non-recurrent \n\nFor the CanCORS/Medicare sample  patients had to be continuously enrolled in Medicare\nParts A & B from the month of cancer diagnosis to 18 months later or death  whichever\ncame first  where continuous enrollment was defined as no more than 2 consecutive months\nwithout enrollment  Patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans were excluded out of\nconcern that their claims data were incomplete  Patients had to have at least one Medicare\nclaim to ensure they were seeking care for their index cancer  Medical record abstraction\ndata were used to characterize patients’ gold-standard recurrence status  The suggestion of\nrecurrence in a radiology report  without confirmation in a clinician's note  was not\nconsidered sufficient to indicate recurrence  Characteristics of the patients  e g  age  race/\nethnicity  education  income  co-morbid diagnoses19 20  etc  and their diagnoses  e g  stage \ngrade  etc  were derived from the medical record abstraction and patient/surrogate survey\nfiles  Administrative codes were extracted from the Medicare hospital  MedPAR  physician\n Carrier  and Outpatient facility claims files  N B  NDC codes were not available from the\nMedicare files during the years encompassed by this analysis  To assign a date to each\nMedicare code the “claim through date” was used for all files except MedPAR where the\ndischarge date was used \n\nThe HMO/CRN database  unlike CanCORs/Medicare  continuously enrolls patients  For this\nanalysis  the HMO/CRN cohort included incident cancer cases diagnosed between January\n1  2000 and December 31  2005  Cases were linked to enrollment  census  pharmacy \nprocedure  and diagnosis data from 12 months prior to the incident cancer diagnosis until\ndeath  disenrollment  or the end of the study period  December 31  2008  Gold standard\nrecurrence status was ascertained by tumor registrars during routine chart surveillance\nefforts  Characteristics of the patients and their diagnoses were ascertained using the VDW\ntumor registry  census  pharmacy  procedure  and diagnosis databases  The majority of the\nHMO/CRN encounter codes were derived from events documented in KP HealthConnect\n an EpicCare-based electronic medical record  a smaller proportion   19% and all of the code-sets offered a specificity >83% \nComparing the pattern and magnitude of results for the 14- versus 60-month time points and\nfor the CanCORS/Medicare versus HMO/CRN datasets  the findings did not appear to\nchange substantially  For patients with lung  colorectal  and breast cancer  adding the ICD-9\ncodes for secondary malignant neoplasm involving lymph nodes and other non-specific sites\n i e  196  198 89  to the core set of secondary malignant neoplasm codes increased\nsensitivity  but decreased specificity  see Figure 1 – left panel  When the results for

Figure 1 – right panel \n\nNot surprisingly  among lung  colorectal  and breast cancer patients from the HMO/CRN\ncohort  the most specific code-set generated the highest PPV's  94%  94%  and 87%

analysis  stage III versus stage I at diagnosis\n[stage-specific PPV's not shown]  No code-set offered a PPV >31% for prostate cancer \n\nConclusion\nWe performed a validation study of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes\nas potential indicators of recurrence for patients with lung  colorectal  breast  and prostate\ncancer  Excluding patients who did not complete definitive local therapy or who had\nprimary progressive disease allowed us to focus on patients for whom we thought recurrence\ndetection would be less challenging  Even so  for patients with lung  colorectal  and breast\ncancer secondary malignancy codes offered a sensitivity of only 56%-74% and\nchemotherapy codes offered a sensitivity of only 28%-62% across different time-points and\ndatasets  The combination of secondary malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy codes yielded\nmore desirable sensitivities  75%-85%  and specificities  70%-88%  but there was still\nroom for improvement  No code-set detected recurrent prostate cancer reliably  To our\nsurprise  there was no consistent difference in the results from the fee-for-service\nenvironment of Medicare compared with the capitation environment of the CRN \n\nThere are several reasons why our findings may differ from those published previously  It is\nnot surprising that chemotherapy codes were better at identifying patients who received re-\ninduction chemotherapy for AML compared to patients with recurrent solid organ\nmalignancies 14 Many patients with recurrent lung  colorectal  breast  and prostate cancer do\nnot receive chemotherapy at the time of recurrence  some are treated with another modality\nof therapy  e g  hormonal therapy  radiation therapy  surgery  etc  and others receive no\ncancer-directed therapy at all  Our cohort differed substantially from that described by\nLamont and colleagues15  which only included patients with node-positive breast cancer\nwho were ≥65 years old and had participated in a clinical trial  Even when we restricted our\nanalysis to patients with stage II-III breast cancer the secondary malignant neoplasm codes\nstill appeared to be less sensitive  65%-78%  than previously reported  Documentation of\nthe administrative codes used as potential indicators of recurrence may have been more\nlikely among clinical trial participants  patients receiving care at institutions that offer\nclinical trials  those who were ≥65 years old  or those who were treated in the more distant\npast  Several studies have assessed the ability of administrative codes to identify patients\nwho developed either recurrent or second primary cancer 21 22 While these studies reported\nsensitivities and specificities that were high  the use of a combined outcome  i e  recurrence\nor second primary cancer  makes it hard to assess how well these algorithms would detect\nrecurrence alone \n\nHassett et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 October 01

recurrent\ncancer  First  secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes alone offered\ndisappointingly low sensitivities  To improve sensitivity  it may be necessary to add\nadditional indicators  such as imaging  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy  or hospice\ncodes  Some codes  such as those for imaging and hospice  could be particularly helpful at\nidentifying patients who receive no cancer-directed therapy at the time of recurrence \nSecond  in light of the observation that cancer-type affected the performance characteristics\nof billing/encounter codes  developing one recurrence detection algorithm that works for all\ncancer types may be impractical  An alternate approach would be to start with an all-\nencompassing list of codes for common solid organ cancers  and selectively exclude those\nthat reduce specificity and do not increase sensitivity on a cancer-by-cancer basis  Third \nidentifying patients who have recurrent disease is not enough  it is also important to\ncharacterize the time when recurrence occurs  Finally  it is hard to identify a specific\nthreshold for sensitivity and specificity that should be considered good enough  The optimal\nthreshold may depend on the goal of the analysis  including whether it is more important to\noptimize sensitivity or specificity  If used alone  an algorithm with a low PPV could result in\nmisclassification such that efforts to make comparisons across groups would yield biased\nestimates of statistical parameters such as odds ratios \n\nOur results are limited by the potential for inaccuracies when classifying patients’ gold-\nstandard recurrence status  Given the stringent definitions used to identify gold-standard\nrecurrence status  the risk of inappropriately classifying patients as non-recurrent according\nto the gold-standard is greater than the risk of inappropriately classifying patients as\nrecurrent  Findings from the CanCORS/Medicare cohort are limited by relatively short\nfollow-up  however it was reassuring that the 14- and 60-month findings from the\nHMO/CRN cohort were similar  Some of the codes used to indicate recurrence can also be\nused to document initial cancer care  e g  adjuvant chemotherapy  regional lymph node\ninvolvement  etc  We tried to address this issue by excluding chemotherapy codes that\noccurred within 6 months after a lung cancer diagnosis or within 12 months after a\ncolorectal/breast cancer diagnosis  the optimal “black-out” window is unknown  Unlike one\nof the original studies15  we assessed the performance of administrative codes as indicators\nof recurrence alone  not recurrence or death  Given the small number of deaths in our cohort\nand the pattern of code documentation  changing the outcome to include death would likely\nhave had either no impact or a negative effect on sensitivity and specificity  The large\nsample size  different cancer types  and various practice settings included in our analysis are\nimportant strengths \n\nInvestigators who use secondary malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy codes to identify\ncancer recurrence should be aware of their potential for misclassification  The optimal\nthresholds for sensitivity and specificity can be determined only by investigators in\nconsideration of their individual research goals  but there does appear to be room to improve\nthe performance of currently available recurrence detection methods  While secondary\nmalignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes may be suboptimal for some investigators \nthey do offer potential and could serve as the foundation for a more sophisticated recurrence\nalgorithm that incorporates additional indicators and accounts for the primary cancer type23 \n\nHassett et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author

characterization of recurrence status  yes versus no  it\ncould be more useful to develop a flexible tool that generates a probability of having\nrecurrence in a defined time period  Continued efforts to develop an algorithm that identifies\nrecurrent cancer using administrative data are worthwhile  because while success may not be\nassured the alternative  asking registries to track recurrence status  would likely be cost\nprohibitive  A well-validated  claims-based algorithm could provide valuable information\nabout the experiences and outcomes of the many patients with recurrent cancer and help\nrealize the full potential of administrative databases for comparative effectiveness research \n\nLIST OF SUPPLEMENTAL DIGITAL CONTENT\n\nSupplemental Digital Content 1 – Table – Provides a

 In light of policies to increase access to screening  this study identifies differences in\nfactors associated with screening among immigrant and native-born women in 2000 and 2008 \nData from immigrant and native-born women aged 40+ years in the 2000 and 2008 National\nHealth Interview Surveys were included in descriptive and multivariate regression analyses \nMammography rates rose from 60 2 to 65 5 % among immigrant women  remaining lower than\nthe 68 9 % rate among native-born in 2008  Among immigrants  short length of residency and\nlower education were associated with lower screening rates in 2000 but not in 2008  while public\ninsurance coverage was positively associated with screening only in 2008  In contrast to\nimmigrants  among the native-born education and income were associated with mammography\nreceipt in 2008  and in both groups health care access was associated with greater screening rates \nPolicy initiatives aimed at increasing access to mammography may be positively affecting\nimmigrant screening disparities  Access to primary care and public insurance coverage are likely\nto be very important in maintaining and furthering improvements in mammography rates \n\nKeywords\nMammography  Immigrants  Health care access  Cancer screening\n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in American women [1]  and\nregular mammography screening is an effective strategy for early detection that has been\nassociated with significantly reduced mortality [2  3]  Immigrant women are less likely than\nnative-born to report having a recent mammogram [4–7]  as well as to receive repeated\nmammography screening in accordance with recommended guidelines [6  8]  This is\nespecially concerning since the number of immigrants has grown rapidly in recent years [9] \nand they currently comprise over 12 percent of the U S  population [10]  Over the past\n\n© Springer Science+Business Media New York

research  a range of factors have been associated with lower likelihood of\nmammography receipt among immigrant women including shorter length of residence in the\nU S  [5  7  14  15]  lack of citizenship status [5  16]  lower educational attainment and\nincome [6  15]  and reduced healthcare access [6  15]  It is not known  however  whether\nthese associations are currently present in light of recent policy changes aimed at increasing\naccess to screening  Healthcare contexts in which mammographic screening behavior takes\nplace are continually changing  and many public health agencies and medical/cancer centers\nin major immigrant destination cities are taking steps to facilitate the delivery of breast\ncancer screening service to newcomer populations  These include programs at Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center  NYU Langone Medical Center  Penn Abramson Cancer\nCenter  UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center  and the University of Chicago\nComprehensive Cancer Center  as well as services provided through the National Breast and\nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program  which was first implemented in the 1990s [17–\n22]  Because these programs specifically target recent immigrants  based on evidence that\nlarge disparities in breast cancer screening occur in this group [23]  the previously observed\nassociation between shorter duration of residence and lower rates of screening receipt might\nbe expected to become attenuated over time  Fear of being turned away based on legal status\nmay also be declining since these programs are geared toward welcoming immigrant\nwomen  thereby lessening the perception that lack of citizenship is a barrier to screening \nSubsidized screening programs such as National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection\nProgram that focus on low-income populations may also facilitate the decoupling of\nassociations between mammography receipt and indicators of SES and healthcare access \n\nTo better understand factors associated with mammography screening receipt  this study\nanalyzes population-based samples of women participating in the National Health Interview\nSurvey  NHIS  in 2000 and 2008  The first research objective is to examine whether\ndifferences exist in associations between demographic  socioeconomic  and healthcare-\nrelated factors and recent mammography receipt among immigrant women in 2000 and in\n2008  Because screening rates among immigrant women continue to lag behind those of\nother women [4]  a second objective is to compare and contrast patterns of association\nbetween these factors and recent mammography receipt among immigrant and native-born\nwomen in 2008 \n\nMethods\nStudy Population\n\nThe National Health Interview Survey [24] is an annual  cross-sectional household survey\nthat collects information on a variety of socio-demographic and health indicators  When\nweighted  NHIS data can be considered to be representative of the native-born civilian\npopulation and immigrants who understand English or Spanish  since survey administration\nis limited to these two languages  Undocumented immigrants and those speaking other\nlanguages are not likely to be fully represented  This study analyzes data from the 2000 and\n2008 waves of the NHIS \n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 2\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript

individuals from 38 633 households\n response rate = 90 %  [25]  The 2008 sample consisted of 74 236 persons living in 28 790\nhouseholds  response rate = 85 %  [26]  Women aged 40 years or older who were born\noutside of United States and who answered mammography screening questions were\nidentified in the 2000 and 2008 waves of NHIS and included in the analyses as immigrants \nThe study sample was comprised of 1 330 and 1 083 immigrant women in two study\nperiods  respectively  and 8 882 and 6 321 native-born women  Sample sizes for subgroups\nof interest are shown in Table 1 \n\nOutcome Variable\nRates of mammography receipt within the past 2 years were calculated for immigrants and\nnative-born women at both time points  Having a mammography within the past 2 years or\nnot is used as outcome variable in logistic regression analysis  To determine if\nmammography was conducted within this interval requires information about the date of or\ntime since the last mammogram as collected by survey questions  Two questions in different\nformats were asked in the 2000 survey  and an extra question was asked in the 2008 survey \nIn the 2000  respondents were asked  “When did you have your most recent mammogram ”\nRespondents could answer by providing the date of their last mammogram or the amount of\ntime since their last mammogram  for example 10 days ago  8 weeks ago  15 months ago  or\n3 years ago  In 2008  respondents could also answer by choosing time intervals  ≤1 year\nago  >1 year but ≤2 years ago  >2 years but ≤3 years ago  >3 years but ≤5 years ago  or>5\nyears ago  In order to study temporal changes in mammography use  we ignored any extra\ninformation collected in 2008 to calculate mammogram rates in 2000 and 2008  This ensures\nthe same computational procedures are used across years  and is the procedure followed in\nprevious research on this topic [4] \n\nPredictor Variables\nDemographic characteristics  socioeconomic status  health insurance coverage  and health\nstatus are entered as independent variables in the multivariate models  Table 1  with\nselection based on previous research on access to cancer services [27]  The specific\npredictor variables included in the models are \n\n1  Age group  Because mammography rates have been shown to vary by age and be\nmost optimal among women ages 50–64 [4]  women were classified into age\ngroups 40–49  50–64  and 65 years and older \n\n2  Race/ethnicity  Disparities by race/ethnicity in mammography receipt are of great\npolicy interest generally [28  29]  and specifically among the immigrant population\n[7  30]  Women were classified by self-report as either Hispanic  non-Hispanic\nwhite  non-Hispanic black  non-Hispanic Asian  American Indian  or Alaska\nNative \n\n3  Citizenship status  Women were classified as either U S  citizens or non-citizens  in\nview of previous research documenting a screening advantage for citizens [5  16] \n\n4  Duration of residence in the U S  Length of U S  residence is included as a\nmeasure of acculturation  This variable was dichotomized as either <10 years or 10\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 3\n\nJ Immigr

based on evidence that a primary component of acculturation \nEnglish language proficiency  has been found to increase steadily for the first 10\nyears of residence and then level off [31] \n\n5  Education attainment  Higher levels of education might be expected to be\nassociated with greater awareness of the need for screening receipt  Educational\nattainment was categorized in the analyses as either <high school completion  high\nschool graduate  some college  or college graduate \n\n6  Household income  Higher income levels are likely to facilitate mammography\nreceipt by allowing greater access to healthcare providers and preventive health\ncounseling  Household income as a percentage of the federal poverty level was\ncategorized in the analyses as either <100 %  100–199 %  ≥200 %  or unknown \n\n7  Overall health status  Health problems have been associated with lower likelihood\nof mammography receipt [32]  In the analyses  health status was categorized as\neither  a  excellent or very good   b  good  or  c  fair or poor \n\n8  Health insurance  Health insurance status has been shown to be associated with\nboth recent and repeated mammography receipt [33]  Health insurance status was\nclassified in the analysis as either private insurance  public insurance  or no\ninsurance \n\n9  Usual source of care  Having a usual source of care can facilitate preventive\nservices receipt including mammography [34]  Women were categorized as either\nhaving or not having a usual source of care \n\n10  Physician contact in the past 12 months  In addition to a usual source of care  actual\nvisits to providers would be expected to facilitate referrals for mammography  In\nthe analyses two dichotomous variables were included identifying whether or not\nwomen had talked to a general physician or to an obstetrician/gynecologist  OB/\nGYN  in past 12 months \n\nStatistical Analysis\nPopulation-based mammography rates expressed as percentages were calculated  adjusting\nfor survey design using information on weights  strata  and cluster provided by the NHIS \nEstimates of mammography rates were standardized to the 2000 US population by 5-year\nage groups  Demographic and healthcare access characteristics among immigrant women are\nalso shown in Table 1  Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for survey design\nwere conducted to determine factors associated with mammography receipt among\nimmigrant and native-born women  Participants in NHIS strata containing only one cluster\nwere omitted in regression analyses to reflect the variance estimate in PROC\nSURVEYLOGISTIC  Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals computed from the\nregression estimates are shown in Table 2  All analyses were conducted using SAS version\n9 2 statistical

age-adjusted mammography rates among immigrant\nand native-born women in 2000 and 2008  Overall  mammography rates rose from 60 2 % in\n2000 to 65 5 % in 2008 among immigrant women  Their rates remain lower than the rates\nfor native-born women  although the gap narrowed considerably over time  from 11 2 % in\n2000 to 3 4 % in 2008  We found that mammography rates were markedly lower among\nrecent immigrants who had been in the U S  for less than 10 years compared to those who\nhad been in U S  longer in 2000  39 3 % versus 64 7 %   displayed in the third and fourth\nrows of Table 1  This gap narrowed by 2008  55 7 % versus 67 9 %  but remained\nsubstantial and statistically significant \n\nOther results of descriptive analyses specific to immigrant women are also shown in the\nlower section of Table 1  Recent mammography rates among immigrant women varied by\nmany of the demographic and healthcare access characteristics examined  Immigrant women\naged 50–64 had much higher mammography rates than women aged 40–49 in both 2000 and\n2008  In fact  in 2008 immigrant women aged 50–64 had higher mammography rates than\nthe overall rate among native-born women  Non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black\nimmigrants had higher mammography rates than Hispanic immigrants in 2000 but not in\n2008  Immigrants with U S  citizenship status also had significantly higher mammography\nrates than non-citizen immigrants in 2000 but not in 2008  Immigrants without a high school\neducation had the lowest mammography rates in both 2000 and 2008  Immigrants with\nfamily income over 200 % federal poverty level had significantly higher mammography\nrates than other lower income groups in 2000  however in 2008 rates by income status were\nnot statistically significantly different  Mammography rates did not vary significantly by\nself-reported health status in either 2000 or 2008  although rates were lowest among\nimmigrant women reporting fair or poor health  Insured immigrants had higher\nmammography rates than uninsured immigrants in both 2000 and 2008  Immigrant women\nwho had a usual source of care  who saw/talked a general physician  or who saw/talked to an\nOB/GYN in past 12 months had higher mammography rates than other immigrant women\nboth in 2000 and 2008 \n\nResults of multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for survey design presented in\nthe first column of Table 2 show factors significantly associated with receiving\nmammography among immigrant women 40 years or older in 2000  Five factors were\nsignificantly associated with recent mammography use  holding all other variables constant \nThe odds that recent immigrants receive timely mammography screening were 53 % lower\nthan the odds for other immigrants  The odds for high school graduates were over twice as\nhigh as the odds for women without a high school education  The odds of mammography\nreceipt for immigrant women having private health insurance were 84 % higher than the\nodds for uninsured immigrant women  The odds for immigrant women who had seen a\ngeneral physician or OB/GYN in past 12 months were nearly twice and over 5 times higher \nrespectively  than the odds for immigrant women who had not done so \n\nIn 2008  the patterns of factors significantly associated with mammography use among\nimmigrant women were different in several respects  as seen by comparing the first 2\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 5\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 August 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

 while age and having a usual\nsource of care were significant predictors  Holding all other variables constant  the odds of\nrecent screening for immigrants age 50–64 are 72 % higher than the odds for women age 65\nor older in 2008  The association between public insurance and mammography receipt was\nalso significant at the later time point  and the odds for immigrant women having private\nhealth insurance or public health insurance were two and a half times and three times as\nhigh  respectively  as those for uninsured immigrant women  The odds for immigrant\nwomen having a usual source of care were also over twice as high as those for immigrant\nwomen who did not have a usual source of care  The odds for immigrant women who have\nseen/talked to a general physician or OB/GYN in past 12 months were significantly higher\nthan the odds for other immigrant women  Race/ethnicity  citizenship status  poverty status \nand self-reported health status were not significant predictors of recent mammography use\namong immigrant women in 2000 or 2008  once other factors were taken into account \n\nThe factors associated with mammography use among immigrants were similar in many\nways to the significant factors for native-born women in 2008  comparing the second and\nthird columns of Table 2  In both groups  better access to health care was associated with\nhigher odds of receiving mammography  although having private insurance and a usual\nsource of care more strongly increased the chances of receiving mammography among\nimmigrant women compared to native-born women  Other factors affecting native-born\nwomen’s mammography use  including family income level  educational level  and self-\nreported health status  did not significantly influence immigrants’ receipt of mammography \nInterestingly  mammography receipt among both native-born and immigrant women did not\nvary significantly by race/ethnicity once other covariates are controlled \n\nDiscussion\nDisproportionately low rates of breast cancer screening rates among immigrant women in\nthe U S  have been of persistent concern [5  7  15  30]  and have spurred policy efforts to\nincrease access to mammography in this population  In view of these policies  as well as the\nfinding by Breen et al  [4] that screening rates appear to have improved among more recent\nimmigrants  this study sought to examine factors currently associated with mammography\nreceipt among immigrant women and whether these factors differ from those that were\nimportant for this group in the past  Our multivariate analyses of NHIS data found that there\nwere indeed differences in screening-related factors in 2008 compared to 2000  Most\nsaliently  longer length of residence in the U S  and higher education level  which had been\nassociated with greater likelihood of mammography receipt in 2000  were not significantly\nassociated at the more recent time point  Moreover  public insurance coverage  which had\nnot previously been associated with screening receipt  was significantly related in 2008  This\nparallels changes in legislation that allowed states to offer access to breast cancer-related\nservices through Medicaid [18]  and suggests that such coverage is a key component of\nstrategies to improve access to screening \n\nIn 2008  immigrants continued to lag behind in mammography receipt  and to inform the\ndevelopment of tailored interventions for these women a second objective of the present\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 6\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript

associated with screening among immigrant and\nnative-born women  For the native-born  socioeconomic characteristics including higher\nincome and educational attainment were associated with mammography receipt  however\nthese factors would not currently distinguish those immigrant women who have a greater\nlikelihood of being screened  It was the case that having graduated from high school was\nsignificantly associated with screening receipt among immigrants in 2000  but paradoxically\nhigher levels of education were not significantly associated with screening  suggesting that\nthe effect may not have been due to education per se but rather some other unmeasured\nfactor associated with having a high school diploma at that point  In 2008  measures of\nhealth care access including having a usual source of care and a recent visit to a general\nphysician or Ob/Gyn were important predictors for immigrant women  This finding suggests\nthat mammography rates can be improved by enhancing recent immigrants’ primary health\ncare  In order to further improve breast cancer screening rates  medical/cancer center-based\nimmigrant health initiatives may need to reach out to recent immigrants in partnership with\ncommunity organizations to improve primary care \n\nResults among immigrant women showing greater mammography receipt among those\nrecent immigrants and a stronger positive impact of public insurance coverage in 2008\nsuggest that programs and initiatives such as the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early\nDetection Program that target these groups may be having a beneficial effect on screening\ndisparities  The possibility exists  however  that other differences besides these initiatives\ncould have influenced the study findings  For example  differences could be present in the\nnational origin and ethnicity of immigrants in the U S  at the two time points which might\ninfluence the results  A report from the Center for Immigration Studies analyzing 2000 and\n2010 Census Bureau data  however  indicates that while the absolute numbers of immigrants\nliving in the U S  have increased  the proportion of the population from each of the top 10\nsending countries was very similar at each point [35]  Similarly  the 2000 and 2008 NHIS\nsamples might differ in characteristics that influence the study results  While this possibility\ncannot be ruled out entirely  it is the case that the racial/ethnic composition of the samples is\nsimilar  as is the distribution of preferred language [24] \n\nThere are several additional limitations in this study  The NHIS data is self-reported  rather\nthan obtained by objective methods such as medical record review  Prior studies  however \nhave found good correspondence between objectively determined mammography rates and\nrates based on self-report [36]  English or Spanish language requirements for participating in\nthe NHIS may have resulted in the exclusion of some groups of immigrant women including\nrecent immigrants and undocumented immigrants who lack preventive health care  and as a\nresult the findings are not likely to be representative of all immigrant women  English/\nSpanish fluency may also affect the ability of women to understand and accurately respond\nto the NHIS questionnaire items  Grouping immigrant women together in the multivariate\nanalyses may also have obscured important differences  such as by birthplace and race/\nethnic background [30]  For example  some recent studies have explicitly documented\nvariation in cancer screening among US immigrant subpopulations including Blacks \nHispanic  and Asian women [37–40]  An additional limitation relates to lack of data on\nfactors that could potentially impact mammography receipt  such as legal status  country of\n\nYao and Hillemeier Page 7\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 August 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\norigin and related cultural beliefs  Subgroups of immigrant women may have different\ncultural beliefs that impact their use of mammography in different ways [41]  It should also\nbe borne in mind that there is variation in professional recommendations for mammography\nscreening internationally [42] as well as in the U S  with the American Cancer Society\nrecommending biennial screening beginning at age 40 [43] and the U S  Preventive Services\nTask Force recommending age 50 as the starting point [44] \n\nThe above limitations notwithstanding  the study findings suggest several conclusions  First \nimmigrant women remain less likely than others to receive recommended mammography\nscreening  and initiatives such as the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection\nProgram that target these groups may be having a beneficial effect on screening disparities \nFurther evaluation of the impact of such policy interventions among immigrant women is\nwarranted  Second  access to primary care and public insurance coverage are associated with\ngreater likelihood of mammography receipt  among immigrant women as well as the native-\nborn  This suggests that access to primary care and maintaining the availability of such\ncoverage will be very important to efforts to identify breast cancer cases at early stages that\nare the most successfully treated  Finally  differences in the pattern of factors associated\nwith mammography receipt among immigrant and native-born women suggest that tailored\ninterventions are needed  Focusing solely on low SES as an indicator of risk may fail to\nidentify substantial numbers of immigrant women in need of mammography screening \n\nReferences\n1

fee-for-service Medicare enrollees age 66 years and older who underwent\nbilateral mammography from 1999 to 2005 within Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium\n BCSC  registries in four states  CA  NC  NH  and VT  enabling linkage of claims and BCSC\nmammography data  N=383 730 mammograms obtained by 146 346 women \nMeasures—Sensitivity  specificity  and PPV of algorithmic designation of a “screening” purpose\nof the mammogram using a BCSC-derived reference standard \n\nResults—In claims data without cancer registry linkage  a three-step claims derived algorithm\nidentified screening mammograms with 97 1% sensitivity  69 4% specificity  and a PPV of 94 9% \nIn claims that are linked to cancer registry data  a similar three-step algorithm had higher\nsensitivity  99 7%  similar

will remain the cornerstone of breast\ncancer screening programs for the foreseeable future  American women receive forty million\nmammograms annually 1 and one-third of these are received by older women enrolled in\nMedicare 2 3 In addition  more than half of incident breast cancer diagnoses occur among\nwomen older than 65 years 4 so the improvement of mammography services remains a\npublic health priority both for the general population and the Medicare program \n\nComparative effectiveness research and mammography quality measurement may be\nfacilitated by data infrastructures that enable efficient comparisons within real populations \nsuch as Medicare claims or the linked Surveillance  Epidemiology  and End Results\n SEER -Medicare data  However  uncertainty regarding the ability to distinguish screening\nfrom diagnostic mammograms has limited the utility of these data for clinical\nmammography research  Accurate distinction between screening and diagnostic\nmammography is crucial for research because the interpretive accuracy of mammography\nand subsequent cancer incidence varies markedly based on examination purpose 5 6\n\nDistinction is also fundamental to claims-based assessment of screening utilization 7\n\nOne source of difficulty was the slow adoption of procedure codes for screening\nmammography after the extension of Medicare coverage to screening mammography in\n1991  Early studies suggested that many claims for women undergoing screening\nmammography had procedure codes for either diagnostic or unilateral examinations 8 9\n\nInvestigators subsequently proposed algorithms that incorporated information on prior\ndiagnoses or procedures to assist in identifying screening examinations even when coded as\ndiagnostic

four\nclaims-derived variables identified screening mammograms with 87% sensitivity and 89%\nspecificity compared to a reference standard derived from mammography data from two\nBreast Cancer Surveillance Consortium  BCSC  registries 10 However  all women in the\nsample eventually developed breast cancer  it is uncertain whether similar performance\nwould be observed in a general screening population in which the large majority of women\ndo not develop breast cancer 11 The algorithm also requires claims linked to cancer registry\ndata  enabling identification of women with prevalent breast cancers for whom\nmammography is performed for diagnostic purposes  However  analysts may wish to\nidentify screening mammography claims that are not linked with cancer registries  e g \nMedicare claims from non-SEER regions \n\nCapitalizing on a recently developed data infrastructure – the linked BCSC-Medicare data –\nwe evaluated whether claims-based algorithms could accurately distinguish screening from\ndiagnostic mammograms in a general Medicare screening population  including populations\nwith and without linkage to cancer registries  We hypothesized that claims-derived\nalgorithms could distinguish screening from diagnostic mammograms with high positive\npredictive value both with and without cancer registry linkage \n\nMETHODS\nData\n\nWe used data from Medicare claims files  the Carrier Claims  Outpatient  and Inpatient files \nand the Medicare denominator file  which provides demographic  enrollment  and vital\nstatus data  While Medicare mammography claims nearly always appear in the Carrier file \nwe assessed both the Carrier and Outpatient files to capture the minority of claims present\nonly in the Outpatient file  ~3% 10 We used Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System\n HCPCS  procedure codes to identify bilateral mammograms and breast imaging and\nprocedures in the year prior to mammography  Medicare claims also include International\nClassification of Diseases  9th Edition  Clinical Modification  ICD-9-CM  diagnosis codes \nwhich we used to identify breast symptoms and comorbidities \n\nMedicare claims from 1998 to 2006 were linked with BCSC mammography data derived\nfrom regional mammography registries in four states  North Carolina  San Francisco Bay\nArea  CA  New Hampshire  and Vermont   http //breastscreening cancer gov/  BCSC\nfacilities transmit prospectively collected patient and mammography data to regional\nregistries  which link the data to breast cancer outcomes ascertained from

older and BCSC enrolled during the study period  over\n87% were successfully matched to Medicare claims \n\nFenton et al  Page 3\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 July 01

Medicare claims\nand the BCSC among women who were aged 66 or older on mammography dates from\nJanuary 1  1999 to December 31  2005  We identified bilateral mammograms based upon\nMedicare claims with HCPCS codes 76091  76092  G0202-G0205  encompassing film-\nscreen and digital screening and diagnostic mammograms  and considered mammograms to\nhave matching BCSC records if claims and BCSC records had the same date of service \nWhen Medicare mammogram claims were present in both the Carrier and Outpatient files \nwe collapsed the claims to represent a single mammogram  maintaining codes for diagnostic\nmammograms if present in one but not both files \n\nFrom this matched sample  we then selected mammograms for women with continuous\nenrollment in fee-for-service Medicare  parts A and B  for twelve months before and after\nmammography  enabling longitudinal assessment of outpatient claims for clinical events that\nmight suggest a diagnostic purpose for mammograms  We excluded mammograms when\nBCSC data on examination purpose was either missing or unknown  We randomly divided\nthe matched sample into two half-samples  one for training and one for validation in\nclassification and regression tree  CART  analyses \n\nBecause researchers using isolated Medicare claims would not have access to cancer registry\ndata  we included in the overall sample mammograms for women with prevalent breast\ncancer based upon BCSC data  which are derived from cancer registries  We used this\nsample to develop classification algorithms for use when women with breast cancer cannot\nbe easily excluded from the sample  However  to address the needs of researchers with\nlinked cancer registry data  e g  SEER-Medicare data  we performed all analyses after\nexcluding from mammograms for women with any prior breast cancer diagnosis as\nidentified using BCSC data 13 We excluded women with prior breast cancers because\nmammography may often serve a mixed-purpose in these women  including screening \nsurveillance  and diagnosis \n\nReference Standard\nWe developed a reference standard classification of mammograms as either “screening” or\n“diagnostic/other” based on two steps  First  we used the standard BCSC definition of\n“screening” mammograms as bilateral mammograms performed on asymptomatic women\nthat are designated as “routine screening” by the interpreting radiologist 12 The BCSC\nfurther specifies that screening mammograms must be performed at least nine months after\nthe most recent prior mammogram based on either patient self-report  radiologist report  or\nBCSC mammography data  Thus  we classified mammograms for women with a prior\nhistory of breast cancer or who report breast symptoms or signs at the time of examination\nare classified as “diagnostic/other ” Similarly  we classified mammograms performed within\nnine months of a prior mammogram are classified as “diagnostic/other ”\n\nIn the second step  we re-classified mammograms as “diagnostic/other” if there were\nMedicare claims for mammography within nine months even if BCSC data indicated no\nmammography in the prior nine months  We included the latter step because BCSC data on\n\nFenton et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 July 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

bias \n\nClaims-Based Algorithms for Defining Screening and Diagnostic Mammograms\nWe first categorized mammograms as screening and diagnostic based on a four-step\nalgorithm  updated to include contemporaneous coding  that sequentially considers the\nfollowing claims data  1  mammography claims within the prior nine months  2  whether the\nclaim HCPCS code was for a “screening” rather than a “diagnostic” mammogram  3  claims\ncontaining codes for breast symptoms or procedures within the prior ninety days  and 4  the\nincidence of breast cancer within six months of mammography 10\n\nWe then conducted CART analyses in attempts to identify algorithms with superior\nperformance 14 CART is a non-parametric decision tree methodology that identifies\nsequential binary partitions in independent variables that optimally predict the dependent\nvariable  In this case  the dependent variable was the reference standard definition of a\nmammogram as screening  vs  diagnostic/other  We included as potential independent\nvariables the following claims-derived variables  age  a modification of the Charlson\ncomorbidity index15  mammogram code signifying screening purpose  76092  G0202  any\nGG modifier  G0203/05 in 2001  mammogram code signifying diagnostic purpose  76090 \n76091  G0204  G0206  days from any prior Medicare mammogram  days from any prior\nbreast ultrasound  magnetic resonance imaging or other breast imaging  days from any prior\nbreast biopsy or breast-directed surgery  days from any prior claim with ICD-9-CM codes\nfor breast signs or symptoms  611 7x  days from any prior encounter with ICD-9-CM codes\nfor breast cancer  174 x  233 0  V103  and the total number of outpatient visits  visits with\nprimary care physicians  and visits with obstetrician/gynecologists in the past one and\ntwelve months  We defined physician visits based on Berenson-Eggers Type of Service\ncodes and physician specialty based on Health Care Financing Administration specialty\ncodes on claims 16 Because we sought an algorithm that could be used in studies of claims\nevents ensuing after mammography  e g  subsequent breast imaging  we only considered\nclaims events preceding the mammogram date  Specific codes used in the CART analyses\nare available from the authors \n\nWe performed CART on the training half-sample of the matched mammogram set  The\nCART algorithm selected splits in independent variables on the basis of the Gini index  and\ncontinued growing trees until no further splits improved the Gini index by more than\n0 00001 14 To minimize overfitting  we pruned trees to optimal complexity based on cross-\nvalidation  The resultant trees were extremely complex  limiting their practicality  We\ntherefore selected simpler trees that included the first three splits of the pruned tree \n\nAnalyses of Classification Accuracy\nWithin validation sub-samples  we created cross-tabulations to compare the classification of\nmammograms as screening vs  diagnostic using claims-based algorithms versus the\nreference standard  We quantified accuracy using  sensitivity  the proportion of screening\nmammograms classified as screening  specificity  the proportion of diagnostic\nmammograms classified as diagnostic  positive predictive value  PPV  or the proportion of\n\nFenton et al  Page 5\n\nMed Care  Author

classified as screening by the reference standard \nnegative predictive value  the proportion of mammograms classified as diagnostic also\nclassified as diagnostic by the reference standard  and Cohen’s kappa  To understand\npotential underlying causes of misclassification  we performed descriptive analyses to\nidentify Medicare claims characteristics that led to disagreement in claims-based and\nreference standard classifications  95% confidence intervals around all point estimates were\nnegligibly small  so we report only point estimates  Study estimates and confidence intervals\nwere similar when derived by using bootstrapped mammogram samples from the validation\ncohort  We performed statistical analyses using R  version 2 12 0  R Foundation for\nStatistical Computing  Vienna  Austria  The study was approved by the Group Health\nResearch Institute Institutional Review Board \n\nRESULTS\nMammogram Samples\n\nWe identified a sample of 383 730 mammograms with matched Medicare claims and BCSC\nrecords  The mammograms were obtained by 146 346 women who received an average of\n2 62 mammograms during the study period  range  1–9  On the date of mammography \nwomen had a mean age of 73 9 years  SD  5 8  The women were ethnically diverse  and\nmammograms in the training and validation samples had similar characteristics  Table 1  Of\nall mammograms  nearly 8 5% were performed on women with a prior breast cancer\ndiagnosis based on BCSC data  The reference standard classified 328 069 mammograms\n 85 5%  as “screening ” and the remaining 55 661  14 5%  mammograms as “diagnostic/\nother ”\n\nPerformance of Claims-Based Algorithm\nWe first examined the performance of the adapted four-step sequential algorithm 10\n\nOriginally developed using a test set with cancer registry linkage  the algorithm had very\nhigh sensitivity  99 9%  but low specificity  34 1%  and moderate PPV  89 9%  within the\nclaims sample that included prevalent breast cancers  Table 2  Within the testing sample\nwith prevalent cancers excluded  the algorithm remained highly sensitive  99 7%  but still\nhad low specificity  52 1%  a PPV of 96 7%  and moderate agreement beyond chance\n Cohen’s kappa = 0 649 \n\nUsing CART analyses  we identified alternative claims-based algorithms with improved\nPPVs of a screening designation  Compared to the four-step sequential algorithm 10 a three-\nstep sequential algorithm had a higher specificity  69 4% vs  34 1%  PPV  94 9% vs \n89 9%  and agreement beyond chance  Cohen’s kappa = 0 704 vs  0 469  in Medicare\nclaims alone  Table 3  The three sequential nodes are  1  whether the mammography\nHCPCS code was for a “screening” rather than “diagnostic” examination  2  whether the\nwoman had received mammography in the prior nine months   97%  Small\nfractions of BCSC screening mammograms were misclassified as diagnostic by the\nalgorithms  most commonly because screening mammograms had claims with codes for\ndiagnostic mammography  Historically  lower Medicare fees for screening as compared to\ndiagnostic mammography may have encouraged widespread use of diagnostic codes when\nmammograms were actually performed for screening 8 9 However  our analyses of claims\nfrom 1999 to 2005 suggest that many diagnostic mammograms  including mammograms for\nwomen with prior breast cancer  are often now coded as screening examinations \n\nIn contrast to the high sensitivity of the claims algorithms  specificities were relatively low \nimplying that many diagnostic mammograms are misclassified as screening  The underlying\nreasons for misclassification of diagnostic mammograms differed based on whether the\nalgorithms were designed for use in claims with vs  without cancer registry linkage  For\nclaims unlinked to cancer registries  i e  that include mammograms for women with\nprevalent breast cancer  the most common reason for misclassification of BCSC diagnostic\nmammograms as screening was a prior breast cancer diagnosis that was not identified based\non review of claims diagnoses during the prior year  Consistent with prior research 17 this\nfinding suggests that prior claims are imperfectly sensitive for identifying prevalent breast\ncancers  A longer look-back for breast cancer diagnoses may have increased identification of\nprevalent breast cancers but at the cost of introducing differential misclassification  Because\nyounger Medicare enrollees will usually have fewer years of prior claims than older\nenrollees  algorithms with longer or unlimited look-backs would likely misclassify more\nyounger than older women as breast cancer-free  leading to lower algorithm specificity and\nPPV among younger women \n\nFor claims that are linked with breast cancer registry data  the most common reason for\nmisclassification of BCSC diagnostic mammograms as screening was the absence of claims\nevidence of prior breast symptoms or signs despite BCSC data indicating that the\nmammogram was performed to evaluate breast symptoms or signs or other diagnostic\nevaluation  Breast symptoms are common among women in the community 18 and many\nwomen may report relatively mild breast symptoms at the time of screening mammography\nthat were not previously brought to medical attention  Mammography facilities may perform\ndiagnostic examinations for these symptomatic women yet submit claims for routine\n\nFenton et al  Page 8\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 July 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

\n\nWith high sensitivities and PPVs  the pragmatic  three-step algorithms can be useful tools\nfor researchers seeking to identify samples of screening mammogram claims within the\nMedicare population  However  with a PPV of >97%  up to 3% of mammograms identified\nwith the algorithms may have been performed for diagnostic purposes  and investigators\nmust consider the potentially confounding impact of these mammograms on study\noutcomes  particularly because breast cancer incidence rates are much greater after\ndiagnostic than screening mammography 5 More complex  cross-validation pruned CARTs\nhad slightly higher PPVs  but the gains would not seem to justify the implementation efforts\nfor most applications \n\nStudy strengths include the inclusion of large mammography claim samples from\ngeographically diverse setting that were linked with high-quality external mammography\ndata  yielding well-powered  rigorous validation analyses  We also developed algorithms for\nuse both with and without claims data linkage to cancer registries  Because cancer registries\nsuch as SEER encompass only 25% of the U S  population 19 the alternative algorithms may\nenable mammogram sampling for research or quality improvement across the entire\nMedicare program regardless of claims linkage with cancer registry data \n\nThe BCSC classification of mammograms as screening versus diagnostic may be an\nimperfect reference standard  Indeed  because prior mammography within nine months is\nintegral to BCSC definitions of “screening” and “diagnostic” mammography  it is\npredictable that this variable was identified as an important classification node in CART\nanalyses  We also modified the BCSC reference standard based on the presence of a\nmammogram claim within the prior nine months  although BCSC records and patient self-\nreport did not indicate prior mammography within nine months  In these instances  patients\nmay have received mammography outside of BCSC facilities and erroneously reported the\ntime since prior mammography  Our results also derive from mammography claims of fee-\nfor-service Medicare enrollees within four U S  regional mammography registries \nAlgorithms may not generalize to non-Medicare claims or to Medicare enrollees outside\nthese regions  Additionally  because study algorithms exclude women with prior breast\ncancers  they are not suitable for assessing mammography purpose among breast cancer\nsurvivors \n\nOur results suggest that simple  three-step algorithms can identify Medicare claims for\nscreening mammography with very high predictive value in claims samples both with and\nwithout linkage with cancer registry data  These algorithms should be useful to researchers\ndesigning studies of screening mammography based on Medicare claims \n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Dr  Karen Lindfors for advice on screening mammography coding practices  We also thank

issues in the United States  Immigrant populations in general have lower\nscreening rates compared to non immigrant populations in the United States  US   1 \nAccording to data from the National Health Interview Survey  NHIS  only 60% of\nimmigrant women reported having Pap smears in the past 3 years when compared to over\n80% of women born in the United States  2  Goel and his colleagues compared cancer\nscreening by race and ethnic groups  Results showed immigrants  Hispanics  Asian-\nAmerican and Pacific Islander  had lower screening rates for cervical and breast cancer  3 \n\nOver the last decade there has been a growing number of African immigrants  Somalis \nEthiopians  and Nigerians  migrating to Minnesota  4  5  There is significant diversity in\nculture  language  religion  and health perception among various African immigrant groups \nAn understanding of the barriers impacting cancer screening behavior among African female\nimmigrant in Minnesota may help to develop targeted interventions  Although several\nstudies have showed reduced cancer screening among Non-African immigrant populations\n 6–10  very few studies have examined factors associated with cancer screening among the\nAfrican immigrants in the United States  This study sought to determine the rates of\nparticipation in breast and cervical cancer screening among age eligible female African\nimmigrants in the Twin Cities and to examine barriers associated with these cancer\nscreening procedures \n\nCorresponding Author  Kolawole S  Okuyemi  Professor  Department of Family

disabled\npersons  refugees  the elderly  and homeless persons  12 \n\nApplying models for health care access and utilization to vulnerable groups can be\nespecially helpful in identifying the particular challenges individual groups face in obtaining\nservices needed  and may provide insights into interventions that might improve and\nmaintain health  We applied this revised model to age eligible African immigrant women in\nMinnesota  As immigrants they arguably experience problems emanating from language and\ncultural differences that may be barriers to seeking health care \n\nConceptual Model\nThe revised Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations  11  is a major revision to the\noriginal behavioral model  a leading model widely used to explain the use of health services\namong vulnerable populations  The original behavioral model was developed by Andersen\net al   13–16  This model suggest that use of health care services is a function of 1 \npredisposing factors  those that predispose an individual to seek care  2  enabling factors\n those that would enhance or impede the use of care  3  need characteristics   a person’s\nneed for care  and 4  personal health behaviors \n\nPredisposing factors include characteristics such as demographic characteristics like age \ngender  and marital status  social structural characteristics that include ethnicity  education \nemployment  family size  acculturation  immigration status  literacy  childhood\ncharacteristics  living conditions  psychological resources  and health beliefs  14 \n\nEnabling factors are factors that would enhance or impede an individual’s ability to use\nhealthcare services  should the need arise  These factors include personal/family resources\n such as regular source of care  insurance status and affordability of getting medical care \nincome  competing needs  availability of information sources and ability to understand and\nutilize the available information 1 14 \n\nNeed characteristics are the most immediate cause of the utilization of health services  They\ninvolve both perceived  self perception  and evaluated health status  The symptoms an\nindividual experiences and their self-reported health status is used to assess their perceived\nillness while evaluated health measures are actual health problems that the individual is\nexperiencing and those that have been clinically identified by health practitioners 1 14 \n\nThe personal health practices domain is another component of the behavioral model and it\nincludes diet  exercise  tobacco use  food sources and hygiene  unsafe sexual behavior  self-\ncare  and adherence to care 1 14 \n\nHarcourt et al  Page 2\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 June 01

cross sectional survey of a\ncommunity based sample to determine a variety of health behaviors among African\nimmigrants in Minnesota  The survey was conducted by New Americans Community\nServices  NACS  from 2006 to 2007  Prior to conducting the study  NACS facilitated focus\ngroups to assist in the development of survey questions that would identify health conditions\nand health care seeking behavior of African immigrants in the Twin Cities  The survey\nincluded items that assessed background  social and economic factors  health care assess and\nutilization  lifestyle and risk behavior  and reproductive and sexual health  NACS employed\nand trained twenty-five interviewers in interview methodology prior to conducting the\nsurvey \n\nThe survey was conducted in-person at the participants’ home in either English or\nparticipant’s preferred languages such as Pidgin English  Somali  or Oromo  The survey\nfocused on urban areas in Minneapolis and St  Paul with the largest concentration of African\nimmigrant families  Of the 1600 households’ of African immigrant families residing in the\nTwin Cities approached  a total of 1009 households consented to participate  Survey\nprotocol and all procedures related to the survey were reviewed and approved by community\nadvisory board and the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board \n\nMeasures\n\nScreening Outcomes—The breast cancer screening outcome was defined as the\nproportion of women 40 years and older who had ever undergone mammography while\ncervical cancer screening outcomes were the proportion of women 18 years and older who\nhad ever received Pap smear screening and the proportion that never had Pap smear\nscreening\n\nPredisposing Factors—There were six predisposing factors assessed in the study\nincluding age  level of education  ethnicity  employment status  duration of years lived in the\nUS and preferred language to discuss health matters  The number of years lived in the\nUnited States was coded dichotomously  “0” was assigned to individuals who lived in the\nUnited States less than five years  defined as “recent immigrants” for the purpose of this\nstudy and “1” was assigned to those who lived in the United States for five or more years \ndefined as “established immigrants” \n\nNeed-for-care Factors—To use health care services  individuals must perceive either\nillness or the need for preventive care  This was measured using self-reported perception of\noverall health  The question  “In general  would you say your health is  Excellent  very\ngood  good  fair or poor” was used to assess the need-for-care factor  For analysis  the first\nthree responses were grouped into the ‘good health’ category and the last two  the ‘poor\nhealth’ category \n\nHarcourt et al  Page 3\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 June 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nEnabling Factors—The enabling factors assessed were  1  Health care accessibility\nmeasured with the question  “How comfortable are you making an appointment with a\ndoctor or other health care providers ” 2  Health care affordability  measured with the\nquestion  “During the past 12 months  how difficult has it been for you and your family to\npay for health insurance premiums  co-pays and deductibles ” and 3  Trust in health care\nproviders  measured by participants checking which of the following statements they most\nagreed with  a  “My doctor always acts in my best interest”  b  “My doctor usually acts in\nmy best interest”  c  “My doctor sometimes acts in my best interest” or d  “My doctor rarely\nacts in my best interest”  Annual household income was omitted in this analysis  because\nmore than 65% of the participants in the study did not respond to the income question \n\nStatistical Methods\nDescriptive statistics of demographics  perception of health  and utilization of the health care\nsystem were collected for age eligible African immigrant women who had screened and also\nfor those never screened for breast or cervical cancer  We calculated mean and standard\ndeviation  SD  for continuous variables and count and proportion for categorical variables \nThe relationships between demographics and perception of health and utilization of health\ncare system to cancer screening status were examined using logistic regression analysis \nSimple logistic regression was conducted first to look at the factors one at a time  Multiple\nlogistic regressions models were then performed to assess the effect of each factor on the\nprobability of ever having been screened after controlling for other factors  Final models\nwere determined using stepwise selection  Using this effect-selection method  effects are\nentered and removed from the model in such a way that each forward selection step can be\nfollowed by one or more backward elimination steps  and the stepwise selection process\nterminates if no further effect can be added to the model or if the current model is identical\nto a previous visit model  In our analysis  the significance level of the score Chi-square\neither for entering an effect into the model in a forward selection step or for an effect to stay\nin the model in a backward elimination step was specified as 0 05  Odds ratio and its 95%\nconfidence interval from univariate analysis and final models were presented  A p-value of\nless than 0 05 indicated statistical significance  In addition  for each cancer screening cohort \nthe fit of three sets of multivariate logistic regression models was measured by −2 log\nlikelihood  Cox and Snell R square  i e  coefficient of multiple determination  and\nNagelkerke R square  i e  adjusted coefficient of multiple determination  and improvement\non model fit was evaluated using likelihood ratio test  The three sets of factors were  1 \npredisposing factors  demographics  only   2  both predisposing and need for care factors \nand  3  predisposing plus need for care plus enabling  utilization of the health care system \nfactors  SAS 9 2  SAS Institute Inc  Cary  NC  USA  was used for the analysis \n\nResults\nA total of 112 women age 40 and above were included in the analysis of breast cancer\nscreening  and 421 women age 18 and above were included in the analysis of cervical cancer\nscreening  Table 1 shows characteristics of participant in breast cancer screening analysis\nand how likely each characteristic was

Paclitaxel\npolyglumex  a macromolecular conjugate of paclitaxel bound to poly-L-glutamic acid  has\npotential advantages over conventional paclitaxel  including little alopecia  short infusion time\nwith no premedication  enhanced tumor permeability/retention effect  and improved tolerability \nWe therefore examined tolerability & efficacy of paclitaxel polyglumex with capecitabine in\npatients with MBC \n\nPatients and Methods—This was a single stage phase 2 study  with interim analysis conducted\nwith endpoints of tumor response  adverse events  toxicities  time to progression & overall\nsurvival  The main eligibility criteria were  age >18  no prior MBC chemotherapy  ECOG\nperformance score   0  major surgery  chemotherapy  or immunologic therapy ≤ 4 weeks prior

requirements \nlack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract  clinically significant\nmalabsorption syndrome or inability to take oral medication  any significant medical\ncondition that would make treatment or follow-up with study procedures difficult or\nproblematic in the opinion of the treating oncologist  The study protocol was approved by\ninstitutional review boards at all institutions where the study was carried out  All patients\nwere enrolled only after their informed consent for participation was obtained in the manner\nrequired by the institutional review board \n\nTreatment Schedule\nTreatment followed a 21 day cycle schedule  The dose levels and routine administration of\nstudy treatments were as follows  paclitaxel polyglumex 135 mg/m2 was given\nintravenously on day 1 and capecitabine 825 mg/m2 was given orally twice daily on days 1 -\n14  Strict rules for dosage modification in response to observed toxicities were followed for\nthe first two cycles of each participant’s treatment  until individual treatment tolerance was\nascertained  Thereafter  these modifications were regarded as guidelines to produce mild-to-\nmoderate  but not debilitating  side effects  If multiple adverse events were seen  the\nsubsequent dose administered was based on greatest reduction required in the guidelines for\nany single adverse event observed  The specific dosage modification rules used in this trial\nare provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1  Appendix  DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS\nBASED ON INTERVAL ADVERSE EVENT  CYCLE 1 ONLY \n\nUse of hematopoietic growth factors  i e  G- or GM-CSF or pegylated G-CSF  was\npermitted according to institutional guidelines and the investigator’s discretion to prevent or\nto treat febrile neutropenia  Erythropoietin use was allowed at investigator’s discretion \n\nResponse and Toxicity Criteria\nDisease response was assessed using RECIST criteria 17 Assessment of response was\nperformed using an appropriate imaging modality following every second cycle of therapy \nA subsequent scan was obtained ≥ 6 weeks following initial documentation of either\ncomplete response  CR  or partial response  PR  If this subsequent scan demonstrated the\nsame objective response  then the patient was said to have a confirmed response \n\nToxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\n CTCAE  v3 0 \n\nStatistical Design and Analysis\nThe primary end point being evaluated to test the study hypothesis was the proportion of\nconfirmed responses  CR or PR  In order to qualify as a confirmed response  the patient’s\ndisease must have responded to qualify as at least a PR on consecutive evaluations at least 6\nweeks apart  The study used a single stage phase II clinical trial design  based on a Simon\ndesign18  to test the null hypothesis that the true confirmed response rate is at most 40%\nversus the alternative that it is at least 60%  The design had a significance level of 0 10 and\n\nNorthfelt et al  Page 4\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 April 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

overall survival time\n OS  time from study entry to death  progression-free survival time  PFS  time from study\nentry to disease progression or death  and duration of response  DOR  time from first\ndocumentation of response until progression or death  were estimated using the Kaplan-\nMeier method  Simple descriptive statistics were used to summarize the adverse event\nprofile and baseline characteristics \n\nRESULTS\nPatient Population\n\nForty-eight  48  women were enrolled in the study from April 2006 until April 2007  The\nmedian age at study entry was 56 5  range  34-82  Two-thirds of the women had baseline\nECOG PS of 0  Sixty-five and 44% of patients’ cancers had estrogen receptor  ER  and\nprogesterone receptor  PR  expression  respectively  at baseline  and 77% had visceral\ndisease at baseline  Eighty-one percent had at least one previous surgery  the most common\ntype being axillary lymph node dissection  63%  and mastectomy  58%  and 65% had\nprevious radiation  The most common metastases were bone  60%  and liver  52%  A\ncomplete listing of patient characteristics at study entry are displayed in Table 1 \n\nFollow-Up\nAll 48 women have completed study therapy  The median number of treatment cycles\nadministered was 6  range  1-32  The reasons for study discontinuation were  disease\nprogression  31  patient refusal of further treatment  9  adverse event  7  and other  1 –\npatient achieved a CR and wanted a break from treatment  Eight  17%  women remain alive\nwith a median follow-up time of 41 months  range  14-46 months  The dosing

including 2 with complete responses  As this failed to surpass the pre-determined\nthreshold  this regimen was to be considered to have failed to achieve the objective stated in\nthe hypothesis for this patient population  Overall  18  38%  95% CI  24-53%  of 48 study\nparticipants had confirmed responses  including 2 complete responders  Table 2 \n\nOf the 48 patients receiving study therapy  40 have died  The median survival  as estimated\nby the method of Kaplan-Meier  was 20 5 months  95% CI  16 3-28 8 months  The median\nprogression free survival was 5 1 months  95% CI  4 0-7 6 months  The median duration of\nresponse  time from first documentation of response until progression or death  among the\n18 women with confirmed responses was 13 2 months  95% CI  6 2-29 1 months  Six  6

relationships\nbetween time to event distributions  OS and PFS  and relevant baseline variables  age \nnumber of metastatic sites  Patients’ status was denoted as being either above or below\nmedian value for each of the variables  No statistically significant relationships were\nidentified in these tests of null hypothesis of hazard ratio = 1  i e  independence  Small\nsample sizes likely precluded any opportunity to identify meaningful relationships in these\npost-hoc analyses \n\nToxicity and Tolerability\nToxicity was defined as an adverse event considered possibly  probably  or definitely related\nto treatment  Overall  treatment was well-tolerated in this study  Of the 48 patients who\nreceived at least one dose of treatment  10  21%  experienced at least 1 severe  grade 3+ \nhematologic toxicity and 15  31%  experienced at least 1 severe non-hematologic toxicity \nThe most common severe toxicities experienced were leukopenia and neutropenia  19 and\n17%  respectively  Non-hematologic toxicity was more varied  as the most common events\nwere skin reaction and peripheral sensory neuropathy  both 8%  Overall  46%  22/48  of\npatients experienced a toxicity of grade 3 or greater and 8%  4/48  experienced a toxicity of\ngrade 4 or greater  No alopecia was reported  The frequency of severe toxicities is displayed\nin Figure 3 \n\nPaclitaxel polyglumex was well tolerated with 27 of 343  8%  administered cycles of\ntherapy adjusted due to adverse events as follows  neurologic  17  hematologic  5 \nconstitutional symptoms  3  metabolic/laboratory  1  and chest pain  1  Capecitabine was\nalso well tolerated with 23 of 343  7%  administered cycles of therapy adjusted due to\nadverse events as follows  dermatitis  14  hematologic  6  GI intolerance  2  and\nconstitutional symptoms  1  Figure 1 displays treatment tolerability manifested by the\npercentage of patients able to receive full planned dose of therapy \n\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough this study failed to reach its pre-specified efficacy goal  PR + CR ≥ 20 in the first\n41 patients treated  the combination of paclitaxel polyglumex in combination with\ncapecitabine did demonstrate significant clinical efficacy for patients who had not received\nchemotherapy previously as treatment for their MBC  PR + CR = 18 in 48 patients treated\n[38%]  with acceptable toxicity  The fact that 40% of patients enrolled in the trial received\n≥ 8 cycles of study therapy attests to the tolerability of the regimen \n\nSeveral other groups of investigators have studied taxane/capecitabine combinations in\nMBC  These studies have demonstrated outcomes similar to those obtained in our study with\nrespect to disease response and survival  However  more troublesome toxicities were noted\nwith these other taxane/capecitabine combinations than were noted with the paclitaxel\npolyglumex/capecitabine combination in our study \n\nThe combination of capecitabine  1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-\nweek rest period  and docetaxel  75 mg/m2 day 1  in a 21-day cycle resulted in significant\nimprovements in time to disease progression  response rate  and overall survival compared\n\nNorthfelt et al  Page 6\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 April 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nwith docetaxel 100 mg/m2 monotherapy day 1  repeated every 21 days in women with MBC\npreviously treated with anthracycline 19 In comparison to docetaxel alone  docetaxel/\ncapecitabine resulted in a 35% reduction in risk of disease progression  p=0 001  median\ntime to progression  186 days vs  128 days  a superior response rate  32% vs  22% \np=0 025  an extension in survival  p=0 013  median overall survival  442 days vs  352 days \nand improvement in one-year survival rate  57% vs  47%  However  adverse events were a\nsignificant problem with docetaxel/capecitabine at the doses administered in this study  All\npatients developed alopecia  Moreover  greater than 70% of patients receiving the\ncombination therapy reported grade 3 and 4 predominant adverse events of diarrhea \nstomatitis  and hand-and-foot syndrome  leading to 65% of study patients in the combination\narm requiring dose reduction and 26% of study patients withdrawing prematurely due to\nadverse events or intercurrent illness  These adverse events led to a median delivered dose\nintensity of capecitabine of 2000 mg/m2 per day in the combination arm  and a\nrecommendation of 25% dose reduction in capecitabine starting dose by the investigators \nStudies have now demonstrated that the efficacy of the regimen was not compromised in the\npatients receiving the lower dose compared to the intended dose  Doses of capecitabine in\ncombination studies ranging from 1500-2000 mg/m2 daily for 14 days are now widely used\n both in clinical practice and ongoing clinical trials  to maintain the therapeutic ratio of this\nagent \n\nIn another study the combination of paclitaxel and capecitabine also led to significant anti-\ntumor activity  with modest adverse events  In this multi-center phase 2 trial  paclitaxel 175\nmg/m2 was administered every 21 days with capecitabine at a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice\ndaily for 14 days of the 21 day cycle as initial chemotherapy for MBC 20 The objective\nresponse rate was 51%  with a 15% complete response rate  In addition  19% of patients had\ndisease stabilization for 6 months or more for a clinical benefit rate of 70%  Adverse events\nwere modest  with neutropenia  15%  alopecia  13%  and hand-and-foot syndrome  11% \nas the only grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in 10% or more of patients  Only two\nevents were of grade 4 severity  As described  this regimen was associated with some degree\nof alopecia in 66% of patients \n\nThe combination of nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine has also been studied in a phase 2\nclinical trial 21 Overall response rate was 61% with CR in 4%  PR in 57%  and 7 patients\nwith sustained  ≥ 24 weeks  stable disease for a clinical benefit rate of 76 1%  The median\nPFS was 10 6 months  and the median overall survival was 19 9 months  The most common\nadverse events  AEs  that were ≥ grade 3 were pain  hand-foot syndrome  and neutropenia \n\nIn summary  we have demonstrated that the combination of paclitaxel polyglumex and\ncapecitabine is tolerable and effective as initial treatment for MBC  although the\ncombination failed to meet the pre-specified efficacy endpoint in this study  This\ncombination appears to have similar efficacy  and comparable or superior tolerability as was\nnoted in other studies of taxane/capecitabine combinations  Given the tolerability and\nefficacy of the combination demonstrated in this study  additional studies of paclitaxel\npolyglumex and capecitabine on other schedules or in combination with other cytotoxic\nagents or targeted therapies for MBC would appear warranted  Randomized studies\n\nNorthfelt et al  Page 7\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 April 01

Background—Researchers are increasingly interested in using observational data to evaluate \ncancer outcomes following treatment  including cancer recurrence and disease-free survival  \nBecause population-based cancer registries do not collect recurrence data  recurrence is often \nimputed from health claims  primarily by identifying later cancer treatments after initial treatment  \nThe validity of this approach has not been established \n\n Research Design—We used the linked SEER- Medicare data to assess the sensitivity of \nMedicare claims for cancer recurrence in patients very likely to have had a recurrence  We selected \nnewly diagnosed stage II/III colorectal  CRC n=6 910  and female breast cancer  n=3 826  \npatients during 1994–2003 who received initial cancer surgery  had a treatment break  and then \ndied from cancer in 1994–2008  We reviewed all claims from the treatment break until death for \nindicators of recurrence  We focused on additional cancer treatment  surgery  chemotherapy  \nradiation therapy  as the primary indicator  and used multivariate logistic regression analysis to \nevaluate patient factors associated with additional treatment  We also assessed metastasis \ndiagnoses and end-of-life care as recurrence indicators \n\n Results—Additional treatment was the first indicator of recurrence for 38 8% of CRC patients \nand 35 2% of breast cancer patients  Patients ages 70 and older were less likely to have additional \ntreatment  p<0 05  in adjusted analyses  Over 20% of patients either had no recurrence indicator \nbefore death or had end-of-life care as their first indicator \n\n Conclusions—Identifying recurrence through additional cancer treatment in Medicare claims \nwill miss a large percentage of patients with recurrences

outcomes such as recurrence and \ndisease-free survival  DFS  following cancer treatment  Population-based cancer registries \ncollect information about all incident cancers reported within defined geographic areas and \nsome registries also conduct follow-up of their patients to determine vital status  However  \nregistries do not collect or report information on cancer recurrence  Registry collection of \nrecurrence and timing of recurrence data would be logistically challenging and very costly  \nCurrently information on recurrence has been limited to data reported from clinical trials  \nwhich include only small numbers of patients and are not representative of cancer patients \noverall \n\nTo overcome the lack of recurrence information in the cancer registry data  researchers have \nused health claims to impute recurrence and DFS for cancer patients by identifying claims \nfor cancer treatment or metastatic disease after the initial treatment period  Validations of \nimputed recurrence from claims against medical records have been limited by very small \nsample sizes and lack of generalizability 1 2\n\nDespite the lack of population-based validation  a number of studies have used health claims \nto impute cancer recurrence 3–10 These studies have primarily defined recurrence through \nalgorithms that have identified surgery  chemotherapy or radiation therapy  RT  administered \nbeyond the time of initial treatment  as reported on Medicare claims  This approach will \nmisclassify patients if they do not receive treatment for their recurrence  a particular concern \nfor elderly patients who are not offered or may decline additional cancer treatment  To date  \nthere has been no population-based assessment of the sensitivity of Medicare claims for \nidentifying recurrences from treatment-based algorithms \n\nIn this study  we used the linked SEER-Medicare data to assess the sensitivity of Medicare \nclaims to capture recurrence for patients diagnosed with Stage II/III colorectal  CRC  or \nfemale breast cancers  We chose these cancers and stages because they are common and \nthese patients are likely to undergo initial curative treatment  with a sizeable percentage \nhaving cancer recurrence following their initial care \n\nAlthough the SEER-Medicare data do not explicitly capture recurrence  we identified \npatients very likely to have had a recurrence  those with only a single cancer diagnosis who \nwere surgically treated  had a cancer treatment-free interval  and later died from their cancer  \nOur assessment included reviewing Medicare claims for possible indicators of recurrence \nfollowing initial care  Our primary focus was whether claims for additional cancer treatment \n defined as surgery  chemotherapy and RT  were sensitive indicators of whether a patient \nhad a recurrence  We assessed if there was variation in the characteristics of patients who \nreceive additional treatment for recurrence  In addition  we assessed if other measures-- \ndiagnosis codes for metastasis or end-of-life care-- were sensitive indicators of recurrence  \nFor an indicator of recurrence to be useful for studies of disease-free survival  it must be \nreported accurately near the time when the recurrence was first diagnosed  Therefore  we \nalso examined the timing of each of the indicators in relation to time of diagnosis and death \n\nWarren et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

National Cancer Institute’s  NCI  Surveillance  Epidemiology and End \nResults  SEER  registries to Medicare claims 11 The SEER data are population-based and \ninclude clinical information about incident cancer for patients living within defined \ngeographic areas  representing approximately 28% of the US population 12 For each patient  \nthe SEER data contain a unique case number  demographic information such as age  sex and \nrace  the number of primary incident cancers  month and year of diagnosis  type of surgery \nperformed  site and stage of disease at diagnosis  and vital status  For patients who died  \ninformation about the month and year of death and underlying cause of death was obtained \nfrom the National Death Index  Cause of death on death certificates is reportedly \nindependently of diagnoses reported on claims  The Medicare data used in this analysis \ninclude all inpatient hospitalizations  outpatient hospital services  physician services  durable \nmedical equipment claims  and hospice service for beneficiaries with fee-for-service \ncoverage  All files include dates of service and codes for specific diagnoses and procedures \nusing either ICD-9-CM codes  Health Care Procedure Codes  HCPCS  or National Drug \nCodes  NDC  For persons reported to SEER who were age 65 or older  94% have been \nlinked to the Medicare enrollment file  Using the linked SEER-Medicare data allowed us to \ntrack patients across time from cancer diagnosis until death  The NIH's Office of Human \nSubjects Research has determined that the SEER-Medicare data are exempt from human \nsubjects regulations \n\n Sample selection\nThe cohorts included all beneficiaries ages 65 and older who were diagnosed between 1994 \nand 2003 with Stages II or III CRC  n=18 127  or female breast cancer  n=8 173  as their \nonly primary cancer who also died of cancer between 1994 and 2008  Patients identified \nonly from death certificates or autopsy were excluded  CRC n=30  breast n=11  To ensure \nthat all claims were available  patients were required to be enrolled in Medicare Part A and \nPart B coverage and not in an HMO from the month of their diagnosis until death  excluded  \nCRC n=5 560  breast n=2 514  All patients were required to have received cancer-directed \nsurgery as initial treatment within 4 months of their cancer diagnosis  Cancer-directed \nsurgery was identified from Medicare claims  If no surgery could be identified from the \nMedicare data  then surgery was identified from the SEER data  Patients without cancer-\ndirected surgery were excluded  CRC n=2 160  breast n=1 085 \n\n Identification of Surveillance Period to Ascertain Recurrences\nTo identify the “surveillance period”  the time after initial treatment when recurrences could \nbe identified  we reviewed health claims from cancer diagnosis until death  For each patient  \nwe divided the claims after diagnosis into three periods  initial treatment  treatment-free \ninterval  and surveillance  Figure 1  The initial treatment period started on the date of \ncancer-directed surgery as reported on the Medicare claim or  if cancer directed surgery was \nonly identified from the SEER data  and no date of service was available  the last day of the \nmonth of diagnosis  Many patients received adjuvant therapy following their surgery  and as \n\nWarren et al

M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\na result  the ending date for the initial treatment period for patients receiving adjuvant \ntherapy was later than for those who only had surgery  To determine whether a patient \nreceived adjuvant therapy  we reviewed Medicare claims for 4 months following the date of \nsurgery to identify bills for chemotherapy or RT  If adjuvant therapy was not identified  \npatients were defined as having surgery only and their initial treatment period was defined as \n4 months after the date of surgery  For patients who received adjuvant therapy  we reviewed \ntheir claims for up to 12 months following the date of surgery to determine when their \nadjuvant treatment ended  defined as no claims for chemotherapy or RT for 90 consecutive \ndays  The date from the last adjuvant treatment claim was the end date of their initial \ntreatment period  Patients could have a break in adjuvant treatment of up to 60 days  \npotentially reflecting adverse events from chemotherapy or a short term delay  We excluded \npatients with a break in treatment of more than 60 days but less than 90 days because we \ncould not determine if the resumption of treatment after an extended break reflected \nadditional initial therapy or treatment for recurrent disease  We also excluded patients whose \ninitial treatment extended beyond 12 months  CRC n=3 467  breast n=737 \n\nThe treatment-free interval was defined as 90 days following the end date of the initial \ntreatment period  Following the last date of the treatment-free interval  patients entered the \nsurveillance period  The surveillance period extended until the last day of their month and \nyear of death  The surveillance period was the focus of our study for reviewing indicators of \nrecurrence \n\n Indicators of Recurrence\nDuring the surveillance period  we reviewed Medicare hospital  physician  outpatient facility \nand durable medical equipment claims for additional cancer therapy-chemotherapy  RT  or \ncancer-related surgical procedures  Our evaluation did not include hormone therapy for \nbreast cancer patients as most elderly breast cancer patients initiate hormone therapy at the \ntime of diagnosis and continue treatment for five years following diagnosis  We also \nreviewed claims for metastasis diagnosis and end-of-life care  including services such as \nhospice care and pain management  A complete list of diagnoses and procedures used for \neach indicator of recurrence can be found in the Appendix  Table \n\n Defining the Time of Recurrence\n First Indicator of Recurrence—We reviewed claims to determine which indicator of \nrecurrence was found as the first indicator  Because more than one indicator could occur \nsimultaneously  we created a mutually exclusive hierarchy for defining the first indicator  \nadditional therapy  diagnosis of metastatic disease  or end-of-life care  Some patients with a \nmetastasis diagnosis as their first indicator may have been referred shortly thereafter for \nadditional treatment  Therefore  we reviewed their claims to determine if they received \nadditional therapy within 2 weeks of the metastasis diagnosis  If additional therapy was \nidentified  we classified the first indicator as being “additional therapy” rather than a \nmetastasis diagnosis  We also determined the number of patients with no indicator of \nrecurrence \n\nWarren et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\nGiven increasing interest in measuring disease-free survival  we compared the median time \nfrom diagnosis until recurrence for each first indicator of recurrence  We also estimated for \neach first indicator the median time from recurrence until death  Median times are presented \nin forest plot graphs  showing variation in median time by reporting the lower and upper \nquartiles  We report median times instead of mean times  as the means were skewed by \noutliers \n\n Assessing Patient Factors Associated with Receipt of Additional Therapy\nBecause prior studies have used receipt of additional cancer treatment to impute \nrecurrence 3–10 we calculated the percent of patients who had additional treatment at at any \ntime during the surveillance period  We used separate multivariate logistic regression \nmodels to assess the association between stage at diagnosis  patient age  race or sex and \nreceipt of additional treatment for CRC and breast cancer patients  All analyses were \nperformed using SAS software  version 9 2  SAS Institute Inc  Cary  NC \n\n RESULTS\nThe final cohort included 6 910 CRC patients and 3 826 breast cancer patients   Table 1  \nSixty-four percent of CRC patients and 56 6% of breast cancer patients were age 75 and \nover  Most CRC patients presented with Stage III cancer  59 7%  whereas most breast \ncancer patients presented with stage II  74 2%  To evaluate potential biases introduced by \nour cohort selection  we compared the age at diagnosis for patients in our cohort with all \nelderly CRC and breast patients in the SEER-Medicare data who had the same clinical \npresentation and years of diagnosis but did not die from cancer  The age distributions for the \ntwo cohorts were similar  although those who died from cancer were slightly more likely to \nbe age 75+ than those who did not die  CRC-64 1% vs  59 9%  breast cancer-56 7% vs  \n53 1%  Following diagnosis  mean survival for CRC patients was 34 3 months  with a mean \nof 25 9 months in the surveillance period  For breast cancer patients  mean survival was 45 6 \nmonths with 37 0 months in the surveillance period \n\n First indicator of recurrence\nFor both CRC and breast cancer patients  slightly more than one-third had additional therapy \nas their first indicator of recurrence  the type of additional therapy varied by cancer site and \nstage  Table 2  A diagnosis of metastatic disease  without additional therapy within 2 \nweeks  was also a common first indicator  reported in 36 0% of the CRC patients and 45 7% \nof the breast cancer patients  The remaining patients either had no indicator of recurrence or \nthe first indicator was end-of-life care  25 2% and 19 1% for CRC and breast cancer patients  \nrespectively \n\n Patient characteristics associated with additional cancer treatment\nThe percentage of patients ever having a claim for additional cancer therapy at any time \nduring the surveillance period was similar for CRC and breast cancer patients  60 0% and \n62 2%  respectively  data not shown  Patient characteristics were associated with receipt of \nadditional cancer treatment in adjusted analyses  Table 3  Older patients  particularly those \naged 80 and older  were significantly less likely to receive additional treatment compared to \n\nWarren et al

receive \nadditional cancer therapy than were men  OR= 0 87  95% CI  0 79–0 97 \n\n Timing of recurrence\nThe median time from diagnosis until the first indicator of recurrence varied by the cancer \nsite  stage at diagnosis  and indicator  Figure 2  For both CRC and breast cancer patients  \nthose with additional therapy as their first indicator of recurrence had shorter median times \nto recurrence than for those with other first indicators  For CRC patients  both metastasis and \nend-of-life indicators occurred about 2 months later than additional therapy  while for breast \ncancer patients  metastasis indicators and end-of-life indicators were found about 5 and 7 \nmonths later than additional therapy indicators  A reverse pattern was observed for the \nmedian time from the first indicator of recurrence until death  Figure 3  The longest median \nsurvival following first indicator of recurrence was observed for patients whose first \nindicator was additional treatment  while the shortest median survival was for patients with \nend-of-life care as the first indicator  7 months shorter for CRC patients and 10 months \nshorter for breast cancer patients \n\n DISCUSSION\nIn this study  we assessed the sensitivity of the Medicare claims to detect cancer recurrence \nin patients who received initial cancer directed treatment  had a treatment-free interval  and \nlater died from their cancer  Our results demonstrate that algorithms that rely only on \nascertainment of additional cancer treatment to identify recurrence will significantly \nunderestimate its frequency  Less than 40% of CRC and breast cancer patients had additional \ntreatment as their first indicator of recurrence and about a third never had additional \ntreatment reported in the Medicare claims  Patients who do not receive additional cancer \ntreatment were primarily persons ages 70 and older and for CRC  women  These findings \nsuggest that prior studies that have relied on additional treatment codes in the SEER-\nMedicare data to impute recurrence are systematically misclassifying recurrences  \nparticularly for elderly populations  and the findings should be interpreted cautiously  3–10\n\nWhile this study was conducted in CRC and breast cancer patients  we do not believe that \ntreatment-based algorithms would have better performance for patients with other \nmalignancies  Indeed  we expect that treatment-based algorithms would have poorer \nperformance for prostate cancer  Because a sizeable number of prostate cancer patients \neither do not receive any therapy at diagnosis  or receive hormone ablation therapy as \nprimary or neoadjuvant therapy  it is difficult to identify whether claims for additional \ntherapies such as surgery or RT represent primary therapy or secondary therapy at \nrecurrence \n\nMetastasis codes were found to be a frequent first indicator of recurrence in our analysis  \nPrior studies have reported a relatively low positive predictive value  PPV  of metastasis \ncodes on claims for identifying metastatic disease in the SEER-Medicare data  ranging from \n58–66% for breast cancer and 64–69% for colorectal cancer 13–15 Although the addition of \nmetastasis codes will improve the sensitivity of treatment-based algorithms for identifying \n\nWarren et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript

patients will be incorrectly classified as having metastatic \ndisease when they do not  Thus  we conclude that metastasis codes on Medicare claims are \nnot an accurate way to identify recurrence \n\nAbout 25% of CRC patients and almost 20% of breast cancer patients either had no indicator \nof recurrence before death or had end-of-life care  shortly before death  as their first \nindication of recurrence  For these patients  there is no way to infer from claims when \nrecurrence was first diagnosed \n\nThis study has a number of strengths  We developed a definition of initial treatment that \nconsidered the variation of patterns of initial care  accounting for time required for adjuvant \ntherapy  This approach likely resulted in a more accurate identification for each patient of \nwhen initial treatment actually ended than if we had applied a fixed time for initial treatment \nto all patients  Our analysis included a large population-based cohort of Medicare enrollees \ndiagnosed with non-metastatic cancer who later died from cancer  Use of Medicare claims \nallowed for longitudinal tracking of recurrence indicators  Reporting of surgery  \nchemotherapy and RT from the Medicare and SEER data has been found to be \ncomplete 16–20 In addition  Medicare has a designated hospice benefit which allowed us to \nidentify accurately when patients initiated hospice care \n\nThere were also limitations with this study  The SEER-Medicare data do not report if and \nwhen a recurrence occurs  and as a result  we did not have a “gold standard”  such as a \nmedical record  to evaluate claims for identifying recurrence  Instead  we identified cohorts \nof patients who very likely experienced a recurrence - those with non-metastatic disease who \nreceived initial treatment  had a treatment-free interval and who died from their cancer  Our \napproach has face validity to capture a cohort of patients who had a recurrence  However  \nthis approach excluded patients with recurrence who did not die of cancer within the period \nof observation  Thus we were not able to assess the predictive value or specificity of the \nMedicare claims to identify recurrence  We attributed all hospice admissions to the patient \nhaving cancer  although some patients who died from their cancer may have had other \nconditions that resulted in the hospice admission  Some patients may have had evidence of \nrecurrence not captured in the Medicare claims  such as patients receiving care from other \ninsurers  e g  the Veteran’s Administration  In our analysis  we restricted the cohort to \npatients with a single cancer and any cancer death  relying on the death certificate for cause \nof death  There have been questions about the accuracy of cause of death on death \ncertificates for some conditions  However several studies that have focused exclusively on \ncancer have found high agreement between clinicians’ assessment of cause of death with \nwhat was reported from the death certificate  21–23 Finally  although the age distribution of \nthe Medicare patients who died from cancer was relatively similar to those with a \ncomparable clinical presentation who did not die from cancer  those who did not die from \ncancer may be more likely to have been treated or differed systematically from those who \ndied from their cancer  These findings may not be generalizable to younger populations who \nmay be more likely to receive cancer therapy following recurrence \n\nFindings from our analysis have practical implications for studies designed to use health \nclaims for studies of comparative effectiveness or cancer outcomes  With an increasing \n\nWarren et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01

expensive and \nchallenging to conduct  there is mounting interest in leveraging health claims to evaluate the \nreal world consequences of treatment interventions  For cancers with favorable prognosis  \noverall survival is an imperfect endpoint  Evaluation of disease-free and recurrence-free \nsurvival is of increasing importance  Unfortunately  our findings demonstrate that Medicare \nclaims are not a viable resource for estimating recurrence  Ideally  as software for electronic \nhealth records  EHR  is being refined  development of standardized approaches for defining \nand recording recurrence will be a priority for the oncology community  Such information \nwill enable improved cancer surveillance and better assessment of treatment effectiveness  \nUntil information

survivors of Hodgkin Lymphoma  HL  are at an increased risk of developing a \ntreatment-related secondary malignancy  1  In particular  girls and young women under the \nage of 30 treated with chest radiotherapy have a significantly increased lifetime risk of \ndeveloping breast cancer compared to the general population  2–4  Based on this increased \nrisk  the American Cancer Society  the American College of Radiology  and the Society of \nBreast Imaging recommend annual screening breast magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  as \nan adjunct to annual screening mammography for these patients  5  6  These \nrecommendations  based on expert consensus opinion  have evolved from the experience of \nscreening breast MRI in women with a strong family history of breast cancer or those with a \nBRCA 1 or 2 mutation  7  8 \n\nFor survivors of HL  however  there are limited data and experience as to how to optimally \nincorporate breast MRI into their long-term follow up and health maintenance  Although \nbreast MRI has a high sensitivity for detecting breast cancer  it has a modest specificity \ncompared to mammography  9  Furthermore  overall costs raise important questions  \nincluding timing of initiation of screening MRI  frequency of its use  and whether there are \nclinical and/or HL treatment-related factors that might predict which patients would benefit \nmost from additional breast imaging \n\nThe goal of the current study is to evaluate breast imaging in a group of women previously \ntreated with chest irradiation for HL  In this report  we review and characterize the \nmammographic and breast MRI findings as well as breast biopsies in a cohort of women \npreviously irradiated for HL to determine features that may help guide the optimal use of \nscreening breast MRI in this patient population \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWith institutional review board approval  a retrospective review of all patients treated with \nchest irradiation for HL at Stanford University Medical Center was performed  Between \n1961 and 2008  980 females were identified  Only those patients who had breast imaging \nperformed at our institution  including mammography and/or breast MRI  were included  as \noutside breast imaging studies were not available for review  Records were reviewed to \ndetermine the age at radiotherapy treatment  radiotherapy dose received  mammographic and \nbreast MRI findings  breast biopsy results if applicable  and the incidence of breast \ncarcinomas detected \n\nHorst et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available

oblique \nimages  When abnormal findings were identified  diagnostic mammography was performed \nto include lateral medial images as well as spot or magnification views as indicated  Since \n2002  mammography was performed using a GE 2000D Senographe or Essential digital \nmammography unit  GE Milwaukee  Wisconsin  equipped with R2 Computer Assisted \nDetection  CAD  systems  Sunnyvale  CA  Since 2004  all diagnostic mammography was \nperformed using digital technology  All mammographic and MR images were reviewed by \ndedicated  fellowship trained breast diagnostic radiologists  Imaging characteristics were \nreported according to the ACR BI-RADS Reporting System  10  Patients with suspicious or \nindeterminate mammographic findings underwent focused ultrasound  US  and US-guided \nor stereotactic biopsy if indicated  Pathology was recorded and correlated retrospectively \nwith the mammographic findings \n\nBreast MR imaging was performed in a 1 5-T scanner  Echospeed  GE Medical Systems  \nMilwaukee  WI  All images were obtained in the prone position with a dedicated phased \narray breast coil  MRI Devices  Waukesha  WI  Whole breast rapid dynamic MR images \nand high-spatial-resolution fat-nulled MR images were contemporaneously acquired by \nusing a combination of dynamic 3-dimensional  3D  spiral MRI to obtain initial kinetic \nenhancement curves during the wash-in phase of gadolinium  GD  contrast by methods \npreviously described  11–13  Intravenous GD  Gadoteridol  Bracco Diagnostics  Princeton  \nNJ or Magnevist  Berlex  Berlin  Germany  at a dose of 0 1 mmol/kg was infused as a rapid \nbolus at a rate of 2 to 3 mL/s using a power injector  Spectris  Medrad  Immediately \nfollowing this injection  high-spatial-resolution transfer  3DSSMT  imaging was done to \ncollect information regarding morphology followed by additional dynamic 3D spiral MRI to \nobtain delayed kinetic enhancement curves  The raw data were then post processed on the \nGE Advantage Windows workstation  Advantage Windows  GE  Milwaukee  WI   12  13  \nThese curves were classified as highly suspicious  rapid initial uptake with washout or \nplateau  indeterminate suspicion  rapid initial uptake with sustained late phase  or low \nsuspicion  slow uptake with a persistent late phase   12  The MRI was timed in relation to \nthe menstrual cycle in cases where it was feasible with respect to the patient’s availability  \nregularity of her cycle  and if it did not significantly delay any workup and treatment of a \npreviously diagnosed cancer  Menstrual cycle information was recorded on a breast history \nform that was available for evaluation by the diagnostic radiologist at the time of \ninterpretation  Screening MRI studies  defined as MRI studies performed as a screening \ntechnique without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer  were obtained annually  alternating \nevery 6 months with screening mammography  Diagnostic MRI studies  defined as \npreoperative breast MRI studies performed for workup of a breast cancer that was diagnosed \nby another modality  were obtained after completion of diagnostic mammography and/or \nultrasound \n\nMR imaging characteristics reported included size and morphology of any mass  the location \nin the breast  the description of mass margins  and the dynamic enhancement patterns \naccording to the ACR BI-RADS MRI Reporting System  14  15  Patients with suspicious or \nindeterminate MRI findings concerning for cancer underwent second-look focused US  If \nthe finding was identified by US  a biopsy was performed under US guidance  If the finding \nwas not seen by US  an MRI-guided biopsy was performed by methods previously described \n\nHorst et al  Page 3\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript

only began to utilize breast MRI in 1995  and that the \nACR guidelines for screening breast MRI were not introduced until 2007  the dates in which \npatients were diagnosed with breast cancer were reviewed  Table 6  Of the 35 cancers \ndiagnosed in 33 patients  1  3%  was diagnosed before 1995  This cancer was diagnosed by \nscreening mammography  with no screening MRI studies performed prior to 1995  Between \n1995 and 2007  62 screening mammograms and 8 screening breast MRI studies were \nperformed  Twenty-one cancers  60%  were diagnosed during this time  with 6 diagnosed by \npalpation  14 by screening mammography  and 1 by PET for evaluation of pleural effusion  \nAfter 2007  33 screening mammograms and 24 screening breast MRI studies were \nperformed in this cohort  Thirteen cancers  37%  were diagnosed after 2007  with 2 by \npalpation  10 by screening mammography  and 1 by prophylactic mastectomy \n\nDISCUSSION\nIt is well documented that young women treated with chest irradiation for HL have an \nincreased risk of breast cancer  particularly those treated before the age of 30 years  2  21  \nSince this risk appears to increase as early as 8 years after radiotherapy treatment  experts \nhave recommended that these women initiate screening mammography at age 25 or 8 years \nafter treatment  2  3  22  23  Many women in this risk category  however  are unaware of \ntheir increased risk and do not undergo regular screening mammography  24  25  Even with \nthe earlier initiation of screening mammography  many breast cancers are still detected by \npalpable findings on clinical examination  26 \n\nMore recently  screening breast MRI has been recommended for this patient population as \nan adjunct to mammography based on the observed risk  5–6  While breast MRI has a high \nsensitivity for detecting breast cancer  particularly for those with increased breast density  its \nroutine use has been controversial given the modest specificity that may result in false \npositive findings and benign biopsies  27  28  Since the establishment of these guidelines in \n2007  there have been limited data regarding patient compliance  biopsy rates  and cancer \ndetection rates in survivors of HL  The current study was designed to evaluate breast \nimaging practice patterns in this patient population at our institution leading up to the ACR \nguidelines for screening breast MRI \n\nWe found that despite the introduction of breast MRI in 1995  only 21% of the patients in \nour cohort underwent screening breast MRI  with 5% undergoing screening breast MRI only \nafter having been diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer  An additional 12% \nunderwent preoperative MRI for workup of a breast cancer that had been established by \nanother modality  while the remaining 67% underwent mammography only  These data \nsuggest slow adoption of breast MRI in this cohort compared to its use in other high-risk \npatient groups  7 \n\nYet with the establishment of the ACR guidelines in 2007  there has been increased \nawareness of the potential benefit of screening breast MRI in addition to screening \nmammography  In a cohort of 91 women with a history of chest irradiation  Sung et al  at \nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 4 mammographically occult cancers \n\nHorst et al  Page 6\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 April 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nwith the use of screening breast MRI  29  These findings are similar to Freitas et al  at the \nUniversity of Toronto  where 4 breast cancers in a cohort of 98 women previously treated \nwith chest radiotherapy were diagnosed by screening MRI only  30 \n\nInterestingly  11 of the 35 cancers detected in our series  31%  were DCIS  which appeared \nas calcifications on mammography  This is similar to Sung et al  where 3 of 10 cancers \n 30%  identified were in situ carcinomas detected on screening mammography only  29  \nThe results of both series support the recommendation that MR imaging should be used as \nan adjunct to  and not in place of  mammography in this patient population \n\nOur study is limited by its retrospective nature from a single institution and its small sample \nsize with a limited number of breast MRI studies  It also is limited by potential selection \nbias  as we did not have complete information about the other female HL survivors who did \nnot have breast imaging performed at our institution to verify that the study population is not \na biased population  In addition  we did not have breast imaging studies that may have been \nperformed at outside institutions  Our results  however  provide preliminary information for \nthe design of future studies \n\nAn ongoing study by Ng et al at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Dana-Farber \nCancer Center is prospectively evaluating the role of screening breast MRI in women \npreviously treated with mantle irradiation for HL at age ≤ 35 and more than 8 years beyond \ntreatment  31  Preliminary results of 148 women demonstrated that while the addition of \nscreening breast MRI contributed to the detection of an additional 5 cancers that would have \notherwise been missed by mammography  it also resulted in 18 unnecessary biopsies in 14 \nwomen  Similar to our series  Ng et al reported one cancer  DCIS  that was identified on \nprophylactic mastectomy but was missed by imaging  further highlighting the need for even \nmore improvements in breast imaging \n\nFinally  when evaluating the use of breast MRI in this population  a main limitation is the \nera in which patients are evaluated and the time delay between introduction of an imaging \nmodality and its adoption into clinical practice  As our cohort only included imaging studies \nup until 2008  we were not able to evaluate the impact of the 2007 guidelines on the use of \nbreast MRI  Future studies will explore breast MRI after 2008 and its effect on breast cancer \ndetection \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe role of screening breast MRI in women previously irradiated for Hodgkin Lymphoma is \nevolving  Further education of patients and physicians is important to increase awareness of \nmore sensitive breast cancer screening modalities in this high-risk population  Additional \nstudies are warranted to determine the optimal timing and frequency of screening breast \nMRI with the goal of earlier detection and improved breast cancer outcomes in these \nwomen \n\nHorst et al  Page 7\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 April 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor

oncologic and aesthetic outcomes  1–4  The existing medical \nliterature on this topic consists predominantly of surgical reports from university hospitals  \nMoreover  outcomes data are sparse in regard to combination treatment with OBS followed \nby postoperative radiation therapy  RT   5 6 \n\nCosmesis is a critical endpoint for breast conservation  There is strong evidence that after \nstandard lumpectomy followed by postoperative RT  cosmesis suffers with increasing breast \ntissue resection volumes  7–9  Since OBS techniques generally result in larger resection \nvolumes and increased surgical manipulation of breast tissue than lumpectomy  there is \nsignificant potential for worse aesthetic outcomes when OBS is followed by standard \npostoperative RT to the whole breast  10–12  In that regard  herein we present early \noutcomes  including patient reported cosmesis and satisfaction with OBS and RT at a large \ncommunity hospital \n\nMETHODS\nPatients with localized breast cancer who underwent OBS followed by standard RT at \nCoastal Carolina Radiation Oncology  CCRO  between July  2006 and February  2012 were \nreviewed  The protocol for gathering and reporting this data was reviewed and approved by \nthe Institutional Review Board of New Hanover Regional Medical Center  In 2011  the \nauthors initiated a prospective phase II clinical trial of hypofractionated RT after OBS and \nthese patients are excluded from the current analysis \n\nSurgery was performed as a single procedure in all cases  All patients had intraoperative \nevaluation of surgical margins by frozen section and  if initially positive  underwent \nimmediate re-excision  all with ultimately negative surgical margins  Patients underwent \npartial mastectomy with immediate ipsilateral reconstruction and contralateral \nmammoreduction  Reconstruction was achieved utilizing the Modified Wise pattern inferior \npedicle mastopexy in most cases  For patients with tumors in the 5 00 to 7 00 axis  a \nsuperior pedicle  superomedial pedicle  or free nipple graft were performed  Surgical \nmanagement of the axilla was dependent upon disease extent  During this time frame  \npatients found to have a positive sentinel node routinely underwent completion axillary \nnodal dissection \n\nThe time interval between surgery and the initiation of RT was recorded  Postoperative RT \nwas delivered utilizing standard fractionation of 1 8–2 0 Gy daily to the whole breast with \nno boost  since no tumor bed was discernible to target  The treating radiation oncologist’s \nevaluation of cosmesis was recorded at one to three months post-RT as  excellent  good  fair  \nor poor for each patient  No attempt was made to control for differences in perception of \ncosmesis among the treating physicians \n\nBeginning in November 2009  patients who had undergone OBS and were seen in \nconsultation at CCRO for consideration of postoperative RT were offered participation in a \nprospective quality of life analysis  These 44 patients agreed to complete the Radiation \nTherapy Oncology Group  RTOG  Quality of Life Baseline  QLB  questionnaire pre-RT  \npost-RT  and 6-months after RT assessing their cosmesis and satisfaction with treatment  \n\nMaguire et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nFinal follow-up to assess patient reported cosmesis and treatment satisfaction was via \npersonal phone call from the lead author  The QLB questionnaire was the same instrument \nutilized for the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  NSABP  B39 trial  It \nincluded specific questions regarding breast size  shape  appearance and pain  as well as arm \npain and stiffness  However  for the purposes of the current analysis  patient reported \noutcomes were limited to overall cosmesis and treatment satisfaction  Possible choices for \npatients’ assessment of cosmesis were the same as those for physicians  excellent  good  fair  \nor poor  Patients were also provided choices within the QLB survey to describe their overall \ntreatment satisfaction pre-RT  post-RT  at 6 months  and at the final follow-up as  totally \nsatisfied  somewhat satisfied  neutral  somewhat dissatisfied  or unsatisfied  The first two \nchoices for this survey question were considered favorable \n\nDescriptive statistics were reported as frequencies  medians and ranges  A logistic regression \nanalysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of patient  tumor  and treatment \nfactors on the development of toxicity and ordinal logistic regressions assessed the \nrelationships between survey ratings and demographic/treatment variables  Comparisons of \nratings between pre-RT  post-RT  6MO  and final surveys were tested by using an \nANCOVA on the ranks  adjusting for the individual patient  Tests were run using SAS 9 0 \n SAS Institute  Cary NC  All tests were two tailed and a level of significance  α = 0 05 was \nused \n\nRESULTS\nDuring 2008–2011  79 patients were included in the study  Patients were predominantly \nCaucasian  85%  Table 1  with a median age of 61 9 years  The vast majority  91%  had \nAmerican Joint Commission on Cancer stage 0 – II disease \n\nAxillary surgery consisted of sentinel lymph node biopsy only in the majority of patients \n Table 2  Thirty patients  38%  received chemotherapy sequentially with RT  8  27%  of \nwhom received it neoadjuvantly  The median time interval between OBS and initiation of \nRT was 9 6 weeks  though this interval ranged from 3 to 35 weeks since 22 patients received \nchemotherapy adjuvantly  between surgery and RT  The median RT dose was 46 Gy \n\nFourteen patients  18%  developed surgical toxicities prior to the initiation of RT  Table 3  \nAmong 22 patients who underwent standard axillary lymph node dissection  4  18%  \ndeveloped symptomatic arm lymphedema  Other common surgical toxicities were mastitis \nand delayed wound healing  Five patients  6%  developed acute RT toxicities  all of which \nwere skin-related  The treating radiation oncologist rated patient cosmesis at 1–3 months \npost-RT as 3% excellent  94% good  and 4% fair  No significant relationship was found \nbetween toxicity and the treatment related variables of chemotherapy or radiation dose \n Table 4  At a median follow-up of 2 9 years  no patient had developed local or regional \nrecurrence \n\nBeginning in November 2009  forty-four patients received the RTOG QLB questionnaires \nfor prospective evaluation of their cosmesis and treatment satisfaction  Among this group  \n14 patients were excluded from the analysis for either not having completed a pre-treatment \n\nMaguire et al  Page 3\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor

22 subjects completed all baseline and follow-up \nquestionnaires for a complete response rate of 50%  However  those patients who had \ncompleted the pre-treatment survey and at least one follow-up survey were included  for an \noverall response rate of 68%  Figure 1 \n\nCosmesis was rated as excellent or good by 87% of patients pre-RT  82% post-RT  75% at 6 \nmonths  and 88% at the final follow-up  Patient ratings at pre-RT  post-RT  6 months  and at \nfinal follow-up were not significantly different from each other  nor did ratings significantly \nincrease or decrease over time  p = 0 7795  Table 5  An ordinal logistic regression of the \ncosmesis rating showed that age  whether chemotherapy was received  RT dose  time to RT  \nor follow-up time had no significant effect on pre-RT  post-RT  6 month  or final follow-up \nscores \n\nTreatment satisfaction was rated as “total” or “somewhat” by 97% of patients pre-RT  93% \npost-RT  75% at 6 months  and 96% at final follow-up  p = 0 1638  As with cosmesis  \nratings at each follow-up interval did not significantly differ from each other  There was a \nsimilar trend revealing lower treatment satisfaction at 6 months which improved at final \nfollow-up  The ordinal regression analysis showed no relationship between demographic or \ntreatment variables and treatment satisfaction  Though we tried to include race as a factor  \nthe inclusion of this variable in the regression analysis resulted in quasi-separation of data \ndue to small numbers  12 African American patients  which required this variable to be \nremoved from the model \n\nDISCUSSION\nThis report describes reasonable early results with breast conservation utilizing oncoplastic \nbreast surgery  OBS  followed by postoperative radiation therapy  RT  to the whole breast  \nReports from major university hospitals reveal favorable evaluations of cosmesis by the \ntreating surgeons  13–16  The current report reveals similar favorable  albeit early  \nevaluations by radiation oncologists  However  since evaluations were made by the treating \nphysician  bias is a factor  More importantly  patients’ prospective evaluation of early \ncosmesis and overall satisfaction with OBS followed by RT was relatively high  These \nresults are comparable to patients’ assessments of their aesthetic outcomes in reported \nsurgical series  17 18  There was a decrement in cosmesis as evaluated by patients at six \nmonths after completing surgery and RT  This difference was not statistically significant  an \nunsurprising result given the relatively small size of the group in this report  Unfortunately  \na control group of patients treated with OBS alone  no adjuvant RT  is lacking  Thus  it \nremains unknown whether the trend of decline in QOL scores at six months after completion \nof postoperative RT may be clinically significant  Potential reasons for this decline in \npatients’ perceived cosmesis at 6 months after treatment include RT fibrosis  progressive \nsurgical scarring  or merely patients’ evolving opinions of their cosmesis over time  The \nupward trend in patient reported cosmesis and treatment satisfaction between the 6 month \nmark and final follow-up is encouraging  However  since the final follow-up for these two \npatient reported outcomes was via phone call from the lead author  patients may have \nreported answers which they thought would be more pleasing to the physician \n\nMaguire et al  Page 4\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIn regard to long-term oncologic outcomes  the relatively short follow-up in the current \nreport limits meaningful commentary for this group of patients with early stage breast \ncancer  The surgical literature supports an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate ranging \nfrom 0–2% annually for patients with early stage disease treated with OBS  19–21  Details \nare lacking about delivery of postoperative RT in most OBS reports  making the current \nreport quite valuable  Because post-lumpectomy RT has been proven to improve not only \nlocal control but also survival  it remains a standard component of breast conservation \ntherapy  22  The potential to achieve more “widely negative” surgical margins with OBS \nmay tempt some surgeons to forego patient referral to radiation oncology  Unfortunately  \nthere is no data to substantiate the seemingly intuitive assumption that wider margins result \nin improved local tumor control or survival  Which subset of patients treated with \noncoplastic techniques for their breast conserving surgery  if any  does not require \npostoperative RT in order to minimize cancer recurrence risk  This question remains to be \nanswered  ideally via a clinical trial \n\nShorter RT fractionation schemes have proven to be safe and effective in randomized trials \nfor patients with early stage breast cancer treated with standard lumpectomy  23 24  \nHowever  theoretical concerns arise with respect to fibrosis when higher daily doses of RT \nare delivered after large volume breast resections  and in patients undergoing OBS  the \nsurgery is more extensive than that of a standard lumpectomy  Our group has initiated a \nphase II clinical trial evaluating cosmesis with hypofractionated RT after OBS to evaluate \nthis question  Accrual has been brisk and trial closure is anticipated in late 2013 \n\nThere are other limitations to the current study  The retrospective nature of the analysis on \nthe entire patient cohort  N=79  may have resulted in selection bias  The authors have \nattempted to account for this potential bias by including all patients who underwent OBS  \nwere referred for radiation oncology consultation  and underwent postoperative RT at \nCCRO  The quality of any retrospective case series is also dependent upon the accuracy and \ncompleteness of the medical record  No attempt was made to account for differences in \nperceived cosmesis among the treating radiation oncologists  The prospective subgroup \nassessment of cosmesis and overall treatment satisfaction is limited by small numbers and \nmoderate questionnaire response rate  Multivariate analysis of the potential impact of patient \nand treatment factors on toxicity revealed no clear correlation  though this type of analysis is \nalso hampered by small sample size  With a larger prospective patient cohort  as in our \nongoing clinical trial  comparisons over time  between baseline and post-treatment  may be \nmore meaningful \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOncoplastic breast surgery followed by standard whole breast RT yielded an acceptable \ntoxicity profile and favorable physician-rated cosmesis in this large community series  \nPatients’ ratings of cosmesis and treatment satisfaction were relatively high overall  with an \napparent nadir at 6 months after surgery and adjuvant RT  Late cosmesis  as well as long-\nterm oncologic outcomes  will be evaluated for a similar group of patients treated on our \nprospective phase II trial of oncoplastic breast surgery followed by hypofractionated RT \n\nMaguire et al  Page 5\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor

affects many dimensions of life and directs their cultural  \nsocioeconomic  and even political perspectives  Gunes Murat & Azadarmaki  2008 \n\nIslamic frameworks may lead Muslims to attribute the causes of illness  directly or \nindirectly  to God’s will  For example  a study of African American  Arab American  and \nSouth Asian American Muslims found that participants believed both health and illness to be \ndecreed by God  human agents were thought to play a secondary but complementary role \n Padela  Gunter  Killawi  & Heisler  2012  In another study of South Asian Muslim women  \nbreast cancer was often seen as a “disease of fate” ordained by God  Johnson  et al  1999  \nAmong Somalis in Minnesota  Deshaw also observed a fatalistic belief that disease \nexpresses the will of God  and the authors inferred that this notion may pose a barrier to \nseeking preventive care  DeShaw  2006  In a study of Arab American immigrants in New \nYork  respondents commented that cancer was a punishment from God for their religious \nfailings  Shah  et al  2008  To the extent that individuals see a particular illness as a result \nof God’s will or from their own spiritual failings  they may decide that that the illness is not \nto be treated  On the other hand  religious beliefs may also provide positive resources in the \nface of illness  as when faith in God provides psychological strength to a cancer patient \nundergoing chemotherapy  Powe & Finnie  2003 \n\nIn a positively-focused  Islamic-centered framework  however  Muslims might turn to Islam \nitself as a source of healing  Alrawi  et al  2011  Thus  if Muslims believe that health is \nconstituted by  and results from  observance of the teachings and practices of Islam  they \nmay turn to worship practices in order to restore their health  A study of Afghani elders in \nCalifornia found that they believed an individual’s health depended upon whether the \nindividual adhered to Islamic guidelines and performed religious rituals  and the elders \nengaged in worship practices for the purpose of healing  Morioka-Douglas  Sacks  & Yeo  \n2004  Other studies have found that that Muslim patients experience physical and mental \nbenefits from religious practices such as prayer  fasting  and recitation of the Qur’an \n Carroll  et al  2007  Indeed  many Islamic observances  like sexual monogamy  ritual \ncleansing  dietary strictures  and avoidance of alcohol and drugs  probably do promote \nhealth \n\nMuslims might also turn to traditional healing practices that are described in the Qur’an and \nthe hadith  These may include the use of black seed  herbs  and special foods like honey  \nOther practices  such as cupping  are prescribed or conducted by specialized healers  Alrawi  \net al  2011  Importantly  individuals may use Islamic healing practices in addition to  or in \nlieu of  the treatments offered by the professional medical domain  In the latter case  by \nturning to Islamic healing practices  some Muslims delay or altogether avoid seeking \nmedical attention from which they would benefit  There are few empirical studies to account \nfor how these decisions are made or to document how often such decisions occur \n\nPilot Study on Afghan Women’s Breast Health Behaviors\nIn 2007  with funding from University of California’s Breast Cancer Research Program  the \nauthors

Northern California view their breast health  The specific aims of the \nstudy were   1  to identify what Afghan community members believe to be their greatest \nconcerns and barriers to breast health care  including both cultural and religious attitudes \nthat may facilitate or hinder their seeking care  and  2  to identify the women’s knowledge \nabout and attitudes toward breast health care  Shirazi  Bloom  Shirazi  & Popal  2012  \nUsing Community Based Participatory Research  CBPR  the researchers worked \ncollaboratively with Afghan community members to frame the inquiry and distill the \ninformation gathered \n\nThe pilot study conducted in-depth  semi-structured interviews with 53 non-English \nspeaking  first generation immigrant  Muslim Afghan women  40 years and older  with no \nhistory of breast cancer  Study results indicated a very low level of knowledge about breast \ncancer in this group  low screening rates  and a lack of awareness of symptoms  risk factors  \nand screening procedures  Major barriers to screening included  an absence of culturally and \nlinguistically appropriate breast health education information and programs  language \ndifficulties  lack of transportation  low health literacy  embarrassment and modesty  Shirazi  \net al  2012 \n\nIn-depth interviews also highlighted the centrality of spiritual and Islamic beliefs in the lives \nof Afghan women  These women frequently mentioned the notion of faith  they believed \nhealth to be a blessing from God  Allah  and understood their bodies to be gifts from God  \nThey considered themselves responsible to do everything in their power to survive or \novercome health problems and to seek medical treatment as necessary  The women \ncommented that  in their religious faith  life is sacred and must be respected and protected \nwith care  Another religious matter was the women’s perspective of the status of women \naccording to Islam  Contrary to common Western stereotypes  many believed that Islam \nregards women as independent members of society who are equal to men in basic human \nrights and the pursuit of education and knowledge  Many expressed interest in reinforcing \nappropriate Islamic teachings as a way not only to empower women to acquire knowledge \nabout breast health care  but also to improve men’s understanding of the issues  Shirazi  et \nal  2012 \n\nThe pilot study’s results produced the following recommendations   1  Training of “grass \nroots” bilingual members of the community in all aspects of the program including planning  \ndesign  implementation  and evaluation   2  incorporation of male-specific educational \nsessions led by male health advisors   3  use of narrative communication consistent with the \nAfghan oral culture where storytelling is used to relate information and cultural/religious \nvalues  and  4  inclusion of Islamic faith components that are inspirational and relevant to \nthe lives of the women and their male gatekeepers  e g  husbands  brothers  and that will \ninfluence these men to understand the women’s needs and support them \n\nDeveloping a Culturally Competent Framework Using CBPR\nThe inclusion of community-based Islamic and cultural concepts fits well with the Afghan \nculture of collective identity and with Islamic views on health and well-being  It also \nprovides valuable guidelines for ensuring that any intervention is culturally specific by \n\nShirazi et al  Page 3\n\nJ Relig Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 February 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

Based Participatory Research  CBPR  principles  a Community \nAdvisory Board  CAB  was formed  composed of community leaders  healthcare providers  \nacademic research partners  a cultural consultant  community navigators  and women from \nthe community  The main goal of the CAB is to ensure the development of culturally \nappropriate cancer intervention programs  Israel  Eng  & Schuiz  2005  Meetings of the \nCAB are structured to help develop a partnership where there is equality of control and \nparticipation by the community and research partners \n\nTo ensure a shared understanding of both research and the CBPR approach  training sessions \nwere conducted by research scientists  These scientists trained community leaders on \nvarious aspects of research  and the community leaders provided feedback and cultural and \nreligious input emphasizing the key elements of conducting research in the community  \nCommunity leaders and CAB members were actively involved  and their views on cultural \nissues were incorporated into our framework \n\nIn designing a faith-based breast health education framework  we considered the women’s \npreferences for formats and how messages and information should be presented  Most \nimmigrant Afghan women are linguistically isolated in their homes  The women we \ninterviewed were enthusiastic about meeting in small groups  where information could be \nshared and passed on to other women through word of mouth  Family relationships in the \nAfghan culture and Muslim religion  however  were understood to be fundamental  In \naddition  men’s gatekeeping roles  together with the traditional understanding and \nexpectation of men as the heads of the household and caretakers of the family  often \ncontrolled women’s decisions about their healthcare needs  Many women commented that \nthese factors not only created communication barriers with healthcare providers  but also \ndecreased the women’s ability to make appropriate healthcare decisions  Therefore  the CAB \nrecommended providing an education program using cultural/religious values to reach male \nfamily members  Because of the sensitive nature of the educational information about \nwomen’s bodies  and out of respect for conservative Afghan cultural practices  members of \nthe CAB suggested that the educational sessions be conducted in gender-specific groups led \nby Health Advisors  HAs  of the same gender \n\nIn the discussion of the findings from the interviews  our CAB decided that the small group \neducational sessions should be interactive  with question-and-answer sessions and \nstorytelling in which breast cancer survivors might share their personal narratives with \nhopeful messages and perspectives  The literacy rate  even in their native Farsi/Dari or \nPashto  is very low—40% had no formal education—so participants expressed a strong \ndesire for educational resources  tools and formats with visual and oral components  these \nbeing perceived as most effective for learning about breast health  Videos or programs \nshown on Afghan TV and websites could also be incorporated into educational material \n\nThe CAB felt that  given the many comments from interviewees expressing the centrality of \nreligion  religious ideas including quotes from the Quran and Prophet Mohammed about the \nimportance of preserving one’s health should be incorporated in educational curricula for \nboth women and their male family members  Reinforcing Islamic teachings would not only \n\nShirazi et al  Page 4\n\nJ Relig Health  Author manuscript

relatives to understand the women’s \nneeds and support them \n\nIncorporating Islamic Concepts\nWe identified several Islamic concepts that can facilitate the framing of determinants for \nhealth and encourage positive healthcare behaviors among Afghan community members  \nThe element of Imaan  which means belief or faith  is the foundation on which the Islamic \nlifestyle is built  It highlights the importance of fellowship and community involvement and \nfosters an environment for social support by encouraging social organization  Da’waa \nliterally means “invitation ” inviting or calling people to know and learn about practices in \nreal life that are beneficial for their own and their community’s well-being  It applies to \nevery Muslim’s own family  relatives and friends  The main objective is to invite people to \nknow about and participate in the provision of basic needs for their community—such as \nfood  shelter  education and health care—through advocating for social justice  solidarity  a \npeaceful and safe environment  and healthy behavior  Taleem va Ta’alom  or the promotion \nof learning and teaching  is highly valued in Islamic culture because Islam considers \neducation to be a sacred duty for both men and women  Shura  or collaboration  is a basic \nIslamic principle that ensure that the views of the community are taken into consideration in \nall affairs and calls for transparency and accountability  The concept of Shura is also used to \nemphasize gender justice and equality in a variety of situations  such as interpersonal \nrelationships within the family and the community \n\nThese concepts provide a framework for family members and kin  who occupy the center of \nthe Islamic lifestyle  The incorporation of these four

to address unmet needs of the Muslim Afghan community  The Afghan \nWomen’s Breast Health Project  AWBHP  a culturally appropriate  faith-based intervention \nprogram for Afghan immigrant women  has been awarded a 5-year grant from the National \nInstitute of Health  To the best of our knowledge  the AWBHP is the first study that has used \na faith-based CBPR approach to enhance breast cancer

\nmore than just a Farsi/Dari translation of materials and messages  Rather  it consists of \ncollective strategies  culturally tailored for appropriateness and competency  The program \nrecognizes the importance of faith and spirituality in this community and  by incorporating \nIslamic components that are important and inspirational to the lives of participants  it \nreframes Islam as a facilitator of women’s health  Crucially  the AWBHP is geared towards \ndefining and delivering key Islamic messages that will promote breast health care among \nMuslim Afghan women \n\nAmerican Muslims are one minority group for whom a shared religious identity may have \nimportant health impacts that are independent of race  ethnicity  and socioeconomic status  \nNumbering between 5 and 7 million in the US  Muslims represent a growing minority \npopulation that is racially  ethnically  and socioeconomically diverse  Allied Media Corp  \n2000  A large proportion are immigrants from Islamic countries  Therefore  the framework \nwe propose may provide a template for reaching a wide range of Islamic communities in the \nUS by treating religious beliefs and their influence on health and healthcare-seeking \nbehavior as facilitators  and not merely as “cultural barriers ” At the conclusion of the five-\nyear intervention  the AWBHP will be evaluated and best practices and recommendations \nfor a faith based program to address breast cancer screening will be adopted  We anticipate \nthat if the program is successful  we will have a model for religious and culturally tailored \nevidenced-based education and breast cancer awareness programs for Muslim immigrant \nwomen  whether they speak Farsi/Dari  Afghan and Persian women  or other dialects/\nlanguages  The knowledge gained and the guidelines developed will have an impact that \nreaches far beyond the Afghan community in Northern California \n\nReferences\nAllied Media Corp  Muslim American Demographic

relative to\n\n4T07 tumors yet average SO2 was comparable  suggesting a shift toward a\n\n‘‘Warburgian’’  aerobic glycolysis  metabolism in the metastatic 4T1 line  In\n\nheterogeneous regions of both

of targeted therapies has been\n\ndeveloped to pinpoint specific mutations in cancer [1  2]  For example  several\n\ndrugs have been developed that inhibit PI3K signaling  which is dysregulated in\n\ncancers of the breast  colon  and ovary  among others [3–6]  Some of these\n\ntargeted therapies can improve tumor perfusion  and hence  delivery of imaging\n\nagents such as FDG  while independently modifying intrinsic glucose demand [7] \n\nOn the other hand  highly angiogenic tumors or tumors with aberrant vascular\n\nsignaling may have limited capacity for nutrient or drug delivery [8]  The limited\n\ndelivery of FDG  for example  could lead to an incorrect perception that the\n\ntumor’s demand for glucose is low  It is therefore important to identify whether\n\nperceived changes in glucose uptake are caused by vascular or true glycolytic\n\nchanges \n\nClinically  immunohistochemistry  IHC  and 18-FDG Positron Emission\n\nTomography  PET  imaging are widely accepted methods for glucose imaging \n\nIHC can effectively quantify glucose transporters  GLUTs  in tumors [9]  but\n\nrequires labor-intensive ex vivo tissue processing and staining  PET imaging is\n\nanother invaluable clinical tool for measuring glucose uptake in tumors or\n\nmetastases [10–12]  PET offers necessary insight into tumor metabolism  but the\n\nmethod is not without limitations  for example  limited spatial resolution [13] and\n\nprohibitive cost \n\nAdditionally  both PET and IHC can inform on oxygenation properties of\n\ntissue  IHC can be used to quantify hypoxic fraction via staining with\n\nnitroimidazoles  e g  pimonidazole or EF5  [9  14  15]  but cannot provide kinetic\n\ninformation due to sample preparation  PET can report on both hypoxia and\n\nblood flow to further inform on the tumor microenvironment  PET hypoxia\n\nimaging with nitroimidazole compounds exhibit low tumor to background\n\ncontrast  however [16]  Additionally  either hypoxia or blood flow imaging with\n\nPET requires the use of additional tracers  further increasing the complexity and\n\ncost of the technique [17  18] \n\nLike FDG  the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG has been shown to serve as a\n\nmarker of glucose uptake in a variety of cell and animal models [19–24]  Uptake\n\nof 2-NBDG can be imaged using a host of optical imaging techniques  These same\n\noptical techniques can also be leveraged to measure tumor vascular blood flow\n\nand oxygenation without the use of exogenous tracers [25  26]  Our group has\n\ndeveloped an in vivo optical imaging strategy that utilizes a combination of 2-\n\nNBDG uptake and oxygenation to report on tumor metabolism [27]  We used our\n\nimaging strategy in a dorsal skin flap model of murine breast cancers and\n\nidentified four parameters that describe the tumor vasculature and uptake kinetics\n\nof 2-NBDG  vascular oxygenation  SO2  rate of delivery of 2-NBDG  RD  rate of\n\nclearance of 2-NBDG  RC  and glucose uptake  2-NBDG60  We used these\n\nparameters to demonstrate that the delivery kinetics of 2-NBDG in vivo have\n\nprofound effects on uptake and  in turn  perceived glycolytic demand  Several\n\ngroups have demonstrated a similar phenomenon with FDG-PET  showing that\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 2 / 20\n\n\n\nknowledge of blood flow is crucial to interpreting FDG-PET based glucose uptake\n\n[18  28]  For example  Specht and colleagues showed that using the ratio of the\n\nmetabolic rate of FDG  MRFDG  to blood flow as a surrogate for metabolism was\n\na better indicator of long-term fate than using MRFDG alone [28] \n\nLikewise  we sought here to demonstrate that correcting uptake of 2-NBDG \n\nNBDG60  by the rate of delivery  RD  showed improved contrast between distinct\n\ntumor phenotypes  The first aim of the current study was to demonstrate that the\n\nratio 2-NBDG60/RD serves as a delivery-corrected measure of glucose uptake in\n\nmurine dorsal skin flap window chamber models containing normal tissues and\n\ntumors  Importantly  the ratio was able to distinguish specific uptake of 2-NBDG\n\nfrom accumulation of a fluorescent control  2-NBDLG  which is identical to 2-\n\nNBDG in molecular weight and fluorescent spectrum  but is unable to undergo\n\nactive transport into the cell [29]  The ratio 2-NBDG60/RD was then leveraged to\n\ncompare different tumor phenotypes and to characterize the dependence of\n\nglucose uptake on vascular oxygenation within these tumors  Our results showed\n\nthat 2-NBDG60/RD was an effective endpoint for comparing in vivo glucose uptake\n\nof metastatic 4T1 and nonmetastatic 4T07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas\n\nderived from the same spontaneous parental tumor [30]  Further  the addition of\n\nvascular information revealed metabolic heterogeneity within the tumors  The\n\nresults presented here indicate that optical imaging of 2-NBDG/RD and vascular\n\nendpoints can reveal interesting and distinct phenotypes in normal tissue and\n\ntumors \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture Maintenance and Seahorse Assay\n\nTwo murine mammary carcinoma cell lines  4T1 and 4T07  were used in this\n\nstudy  Though arising from the same tumor  the cell lines have distinct different\n\nmetastatic potential [31]  4T1 cells have been shown to metastasize throughout\n\nthe body to organs such as the lung  liver  bone and brain  4T07 is able to seed\n\ninto the lung and liver but it fails to engraft to form metastatic nodules  Both cell\n\nlines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium  DMEM  Gibco \n\nCarlsbad  California  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

 Massachusetts  USA]\n\nwas used to measure the metabolic properties of 4T1 and 4T07 cells  Oxygen\n\nconsumption rate  OCR  and extracellular acidification rate  ECAR  were\n\nmeasured every 11 minutes  OCR was calculated based on changes in dissolved\n\noxygen in the cell media and ECAR was calculated based on detection of changes\n\nin free proton concentration in the cell media  Between minute 22 and minute 33\n\nof the assay  25 mM glucose was injected to each well  Between minute 55 and\n\nminute 66  1 uM oligomycin was injected to each well  Oligomycin inhibits\n\noxygen

to food and water \n\nImaging Platform\n\nOur imaging system and procedure have both been described in detail [27  34]  A\n\nZeiss Axioskop 2 microscope fitted with a 2 5x objective  NA50 075  was used for\n\nboth trans-illumination vascular imaging and epi-illumination fluorescence  2-\n\nNBDG  imaging  A liquid crystal tunable filter  LCTF  was used for hyperspectral\n\nimaging  and a DVC

the integration time used for imaging  The average pixel\n\nintensity of the corresponding rhodamine image was then used to linearly scale 2-\n\nNBDG and 2-NBDLG images \n\nImaging Procedure\n\nDuring the 6-hour period prior to imaging  animals were fasted but allowed access\n\nto water  Immediately before imaging  blood glucose was measured from the tail\n\nvein using a FreeStyle Lite Blood

tumors  each endpoint  2-NBDG60  RD  2-NBDG60/RD  was\n\nadditionally parsed by SO2  For each 2-NBDG60  RD  or 2-NBDG60/RD image \n\nevery tissue pixel in the tumor area was assigned to an SO2 group

represents the mean of\n\ndistributions of 2-NBDG60  RD  or 2-NBDG60/RD pixels at a given SO2 level from\n\nup to 8 mice \n\nThe blood flow imaging procedure has previously been described in detail [26] \n\nIn short  a video of individual red blood cells flowing through vessels in a non-\n\ntumor bearing window chamber was collected  taking advantage of the absorption\n\nproperties of hemoglobin  A cross-correlation was performed between subsequent\n\nframes to track red blood cell movement  For each mouse  we calculated both\n\nblood velocity and 2-NBDG delivery  RD  in the image region surrounding the\n\nvessel with the fastest blood velocity  This allowed us to achieve a wide range of\n\nblood velocities over which to correlate blood velocity with RD  For a given\n\nmouse  the same region was selected in corresponding blood velocity and 2-\n\nNBDG images  and kept consistent between days \n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nSeahorse assay results were compared with unpaired student’s t-tests  Results\n\nshowing 6 mM and 10 mM doses of 2-NBDG  kinetics at baseline and after\n\nhypoxia  or endpoints from 2-NBDG and 2-NBDLG imaging were compared\n\nusing a student’s paired t-test  Each paired test corresponds to the same cohort of\n\nmice being imaged on consecutive days under two different imaging parameters \n\nImaging order was scrambled in all studies- for example  half the mice received\n\n6 mM 2-NBDG on day 1 and 10 mM 2-NBDG on day 2  and half received 10 mM\n\n2-NBDG on day 1 and 6 mM 2-NBDG on day 2  Correlations between parameters\n\nwere determined by Pearson’s linear correlation  For tumor studies containing\n\nmultiple groups  a one-way analysis of variance  ANOVA  was performed to test\n\nfor global differences and a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test was used to compare\n\nbetween groups  Survival curves were compared using repeated measures\n\nANOVA  For all analyses  differences between groups were deemed significant at a\n\n95% confidence level  p#0 05

more\n\naccurately the glycolytic uptake in vivo  To validate our method of delivery\n\ncorrection  we first showed that the rate of delivery was significantly correlated\n\nwith delivery-linked variables  Varying the injected concentration of 2-NBDG\n\nfrom 6 mM to 10 mM was sufficient to cause an increase in the rate of delivery \n\ndue to an increased 2-NBDG fluorescence at 5-minutes after

blood cells in\n\nnormal  non-tumor  vasculature  As hypothesized  we saw a corresponding\n\nincrease in the rate of 2-NBDG delivery  Prior to hypoxia  the range of blood flow\n\nvelocities was not

surprising because\nmetabolic substrate delivery is tightly correlated to demand in normal tissue\n\n[39  40] and glucose demand is increased by hypoxia [41] \n\nTo investigate whether correction for delivery effects altered the relationship\n\nbetween glucose and 2-NBDG  we calculated the correlations between 2-NBDG60\nand blood glucose concentration and between 2-NBDG60/RD and blood glucose\n\nconcentration  A moderate inverse correlation was seen between 2-NBDG60/RD\nand blood glucose concentration  R520 61  p50 02  as well as between 2-\nNBDG60 and blood glucose concentration  R520 52  p50 05  not shown \nindicating that 2-NBDG competition with blood glucose is real  and not an\n\nartifact of delivery correction  The trends we observed are consistent with in vitro\n\nstudies of oral neoplasia showing that 2-NBDG uptake is competitively inhibited\n\nby glucose  and 2-NBDG fluorescence decreases with increasing glucose\n\nconcentration [19]  Further  2-NBDG uptake has been shown to increase with an\n\nincrease in glucose demand  For example  Sheth and colleagues showed in vivo\n\nthat 2-NBDG uptake in the brain increases greatly during a seizure  a well-\n\nestablished instance of increased glucose demand [23]  In accordance with these\n\nfindings  we now show that blood glucose competes with 2-NBDG in vivo  and\n\ncaution that major variations in blood glucose may change the interpretation of 2-\n\nNBDG data \n\nWe then asked if 2-NBDG60/RD was capable of distinguishing between\n\ncontrolled instances of varied tracer uptake in vivo  We used 2-NBDG in\n\nunperturbed normal tissue in vivo  taking advantage of the baseline level of\n\nglucose demand  To simulate a contrasting situation of negligible demand in vivo \n\nwe used the fluorescent molecule 2-NBDLG  which has been developed for use as\n\na 2-NBDG control substance [29]  Though identical in molecular weight and\n\nfluorescent spectrum to 2-NBDG  2-NBDLG is unrecognized by the GLUT\n\nreceptors and cannot be actively transported into the cell  Instead  2-NBDLG\n\nfluorescence may represent non-specific adsorption onto the cell membrane or\n\nuptake through damaged membrane [29]  2-NBDLG fluorescence may also\n\ncorrespond to tracer accumulation in the interstitial space  though we have shown\n\nthat the specific probe 2-NBDG clears the interstitial space by 60 minutes after\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 15 / 20\n\n\n\ninjection [27]  We hypothesized that  for a given animal  uptake of 2-NBDG\n\nwould exceed uptake of 2-NBDLG  Interestingly  2-NBDG and 2-NBDLG\n\nfluorescence intensities at 60 minutes were indistinguishable in each animal  In a\n\nseparate experiment  we found that the average fluorescent intensity of 100 nM 2-\n\nNBDLG in solution was approximately 25% greater than the fluorescent intensity\n\nof 100 nM 2-NBDG  data not shown  indicating a greater fluorescence quantum\n\nyield for the control solution  We caution that care must be taken to properly\n\ncalibrate for differences in fluorescent behavior when using a control marker for\n\n2-NBDG in vitro or in vivo  Our results showed that our correction by RD was able\n\nto account for the difference in fluorescence intensity between 2-NBDLG and\n\n2-NBDG  After correcting for a greater max intensity of 2-NBDLG  2-NBDG\n\naccumulation was approximately 3-fold higher than 2-NBDLG accumulation in\n\nall animals  indicating that we were able to identify stereo-specific uptake \n\nSince metabolic substrate delivery is tightly controlled in normal tissue [39  40] \n\nexternal perturbations were needed to observe significant changes in delivery and\n\ndemand  This allowed us to validate our method in a controlled way  However \n\nour ultimate goal was to utilize our strategy to characterize tumors  where delivery\n\nand demand may be ‘‘mis-matched’’  Using PET to find discrepancies between\n\nblood flow and FDG delivery has proven useful for characterizing disease in heart\n\nand brain tissue [42  43]  Specht  et al  were among the first to use functional\n\nimaging to uncover an altered relationship between tumor metabolism and blood\n\nflow that existed in breast cancer subtypes [28]  We  too  hypothesized that our\n\nmethod correlated to the long-term fate of different tumor subtypes- in particular \n\nmetastatic potential  As previously mentioned  4T1 is a metastatic murine\n\nmammary tumor line  and 4T07 is a non-metastatic sister murine mammary\n\ntumor line [30  31]  An assessment of 2-NBDG60/RD values averaged over the\n\nentire tumor regions revealed that glycolytic uptake of the 4T1 tumors far\n\nexceeded that of 4T07 tumors  as shown by our previous results [27] and now\n\ncorroborated by a Seahorse assay \n\nWe additionally showed that these differences are not due to differences in\n\noxygenation  as average SO2  vascular density and oxygen consumption rate were\n\ncomparable between 4T1 and 4T07 tumors  Our in vivo and Seahorse in vitro\n\nresults are consistent with previous work showing that lactate concentration in\n\ntumors both fuels tumor growth and is predictive of metastasis [44–47]  Recently \n\nSonveaux et  al have proposed a mechanism which may underlie the association\n\nbetween lactate and tumor aggressiveness  They showed that lactate upregulates\n\nHIF-1 in endothelial cells  and that blocking lactate entry through monocarbox-\n\nylate transporter 1 can prevent endothelial migration and tumor angiogenesis\n\n[48] \n\nLastly  we wanted to investigate regional trends in 2-NBDG uptake  as it is well\n\nestablished that the tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous with\n\nrespect to oxygenation [36  37  49]  For example  vascular remodeling in tumors\n\nleads to areas of decreased oxygen delivery to the cells  Studies in window\n\nchambers have shown that tumor tissue can approach anoxia as close as 100 um\n\nfrom a vessel [50]  However  cells are often able to compensate by increasing\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 16 / 20\n\n\n\nglucose uptake for use in glycolysis [41]  We would then expect 2-NBDG uptake\n\nto increase as SO2 decreases  A combination of low 2-NBDG uptake and low SO2 \n\nhowever  may indicate non-viable cells chronically starved of both glucose and\n\noxygen [51  52]  Modeling has shown that glucose diffuses farther than oxygen\n\n[53] and that glucose concentration decreases only slightly over a distance of  30\ncells from a vessel [54]  We excluded pixels farther than 150 mm from a vessel to\nensure that non-viable cells were not mischaracterized \n\nInterestingly  we observed in 4T1 that 2-NBDG60 uptake was lowest in regions\n\nof very low oxygenation  Looking at RD reveals that diminished delivery\n\ncontributes to low levels of 2-NBDG uptake in hypoxic regions  After correcting\n\nfor decreased delivery to viable cells  the poorly oxygenated 4T1 regions showed\n\nelevated 2-NBDG60/RD compared to tumor’s well-oxygenated regions  On the\n\nother hand  4T07 tumors did not exhibit hypoxic regions nor regions of poor 2-\n\nNBDG delivery  As in 4T1 tumors  2-NBDG60/RD increased significantly as\n\nvascular oxygenation decreased in 4T07 \n\nIn addition to sustaining the highest 2-NBDG60 at all oxygenation levels  the\n\n4T1 tumors also had lower RD than 4T07 tumors or normal tissue  For our\n\ndataset  a lower RD corresponded to a longer 2-NBDG delivery time-to-max \n\nindicating impeded delivery  mean Tmax 4T1510 88 min  mean\nTmax 4T0757 20 min  mean Tmax norm54 42 min  Tumors often have impeded\ndelivery of nutrients due to the immature and tortuous vessels created by\n\nangiogenesis [37]  Interestingly  some tumors with long capillary transport times\n\nadapt by upregulating aerobic glycolysis [55]  This type of Warburgian\n\nmetabolism would be consistent with our findings for 4T1  which had sustained\n\nhigh glucose uptake across oxygen levels \n\nAs a last consideration  it is important to note that our strategy may be\n\nparticularly effective in regions of poor delivery  identified by slow blood velocity\n\nor hypoxia  Mankoff and colleagues have demonstrated with FDG-PET that a\n\nmismatch between tumor metabolism and blood flow  in particular high\n\nmetabolic rate relative to blood flow  is an indicator of poor prognosis in tumors\n\n[56]  For this reason  we have developed our method to help us quickly identify\n\ntumor regions with poor delivery but sustained 2-NBDG uptake  Additionally \n\nhypoxia is an indicator of poor prognosis in regard to treatment response \n\nrecurrence  and overall outcome [57–59]  so the ability to identify hypoxic tumor\n\nregions is crucial  With further development  our method of imaging delivery-\n\ncorrected 2-NBDG uptake and oxygenation is well-poised as a tool for pre-clinical\n\nand clinical tumor characterization \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to

attracted increasing attention as an important topic \nin health research since passage of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 [16  7]  Increased \nfocus on the participation of ethnic minority populations emerged with Healthy People 2010  \nwhich established the inclusion of ethnic minorities in health research as an overarching goal \nthat is essential for ensuring the elimination of health disparities [22]  However  despite \nsignificant efforts  ethnic minorities are frequently underrepresented  and disparities in early \ndetection  treatment  mortality  and survivorship related to ethnicity still exist [25] \n\nMore specifically  the participation of ethnic minorities such as Asian-Americans in cancer \nsurvivorship studies has persistently lagged behind that of Whites [11  20]  Significant gaps \nexist in terms of health-related quality of life  HRQOL  and coping for ethnic minority \ncancer survivors and their family members  For example  Asian American subgroups have \nbeen combined under the umbrella category of ‘Asian Americans ’ or excluded from \nresearch or placed in the ‘other’ category  Fewer studies also showed inconsistent findings \nin terms of HRQOL experiences of Asian-American subgroups due to small sample sizes of \nethnic subgroups [3  13]  Furthermore  given that cultures might affect the coping and \ncommunication process between cancer survivors and their families [14]  investigations \nwhich employ convenient samples with primarily white survivors may limit the \ngeneralizability of findings in coping and communication studies  Thus  recruiting more \nAsian-American populations into cancer survivorship studies is critical to allow for better \ninterpretability of the findings \n\nRobinson and Trochim [19] noted the paucity of detailed information on the causes of the \nlow participation rates of ethnic minority populations  Nevertheless  several studies have \ndescribed a variety of factors that potentially affect recruitment among ethnic minority \ncancer patients  For example  language barriers  lower socio-economic status  SES  lack of \nhealth insurance and care  unstable employment status  and cultural factors impede the \nparticipation of Asian-Americans in cancer research [26  10  4]  Because of these \nchallenges  researchers often perceive that Asian-Americans are less willing to participate in \nresearch or that Asian-American groups are difficult to reach [4] \n\nTo date  a variety of strategies specific for recruiting ethnic minorities have been tried  For \nexample  Dignan and colleagues [5] developed the clinic-based recruitment plan \ncollaboratively to work with the research team and the clinic staff  and provided incentive \npayments considering gas prices  Friedman and colleagues [6] suggested flexibility with \nscheduling  and engagement with community advisors using formalized process  Another \nstudy emphasized the development of a community-based culturally and linguistically \nappropriate educational intervention to increase health literacy in cancer communication \n[15]  Despite the gain in knowledge in this area  the lack of sufficient representation of \nAsian-Americans remains a challenge to improving cancer research and ultimately \neliminating ethnic disparities in health outcomes \n\nIn this paper  we utilize data from an outcome study that actively recruited Asian-American \ncancer survivors to describe ethnic minority recruitment experiences  Although this study \n\nLim and Paek Page 2\n\nJ Cancer Educ  Author manuscript  available in

various \nstrategies  e g  the use of cancer registries  community outreach  trusted community \nmembers  contacts with participants from previous studies  and snowball sampling  were \nadopted to enroll and gain consent from participants  Based on our experiences  we discuss \nchallenges to the successful recruitment of Asian-American patients in cancer survivorship \nresearch and provide recommendations for future recruitment efforts \n\nMETHODS\nThe original study intended to investigate the role of family communication in coping and \nquality of life for Chinese- and Korean-American breast cancer survivors  BCS  The study \nemployed a culturally responsive model [2] for ethnic minority inclusion in survivorship \nresearch to maximize Asian-American recruitment  The study was approved by the \ninstitutional review board at the study sites \n\nParticipants\nStudy participants included 157 Chinese-  n=86  and Korean-American  n=71  BCS living \nin LA  Eligibility criteria for inclusion were as follows   1  self-identifying as Chinese or \nKorean   2  being within 1–5 years of a breast cancer diagnosis  stage I –III   3  having \ncompleted active treatment   4  being 18 years old or older  and  5  being able to speak \nChinese  Korean  or English  Survivors of a more advanced stage of cancer  i e  stage IV  \nthose with other cancer diagnoses  and those with other major medical  e g  heart disease  \nstroke  and psychiatric  e g  major depression  schizophrenia  conditions were excluded \nbecause their medical characteristics  e g  disease progression and prognosis  were \nsignificantly different from their study counterparts \n\nRecruitment\nPrior to the recruitment of participants  all materials  i e  flyers  questionnaires  were \nprovided in both English and Chinese/Korean  because most Chinese- and Korean-\nAmericans have limited English proficiency  Using a rigorous “forward-backward” \ntranslation procedure  the English versions of the materials were translated and back-\ntranslated into Chinese and Korean by independent bilingual translators  The panel of \ntranslators then compared the two English versions to ensure that they were equivalent  \nCorrections were made until equivalence was achieved \n\nParticipants were recruited mainly from the California Cancer Surveillance program  CSP  \nspecifically  the LA  Desert Sierra  and Orange sites  and from local LA hospital cancer \nregistries from October 2009 to April 2011  As the largest county in California  LA County \nis a diverse urban and suburban area with a population exceeding 12 million  The 2010 \ncensus documented that LA County consisted of approximately 15% Asian-Americans  Of \nall Asian Americans living in LA County  Chinese-Americans comprised 27% and Korean-\nAmericans comprised 16%  indicating greater percentages compared to those in other areas \n[21] \n\nAccording to the CSP-designated procedures  a letter to each patient’s physician was first \nsent to notify the doctor of the study and invite his/her patients to participate  Invitation \n\nLim and Paek Page 3\n\nJ Cancer Educ  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01

\nnot respond within two weeks indicating that she should not be contacted for health/medical \nreasons  This mailing also included a patient response form to allow the patient to express \ninterest in participating in the study or to request more information  If the patient response \nform was returned indicating interest  the potential participant received a screening \ntelephone call  If the patient response form was not received within two weeks of mailing  \nthe potential participant received telephone calls from a trained ethnically and linguistically \nmatched research assistant  RA  During this conversation  the RA indicated that an \ninvitation letter had been mailed  the study was described  any questions regarding the study \nwere answered  and the informed consent form was mentioned  If the potential participant \nwas interested  then the RA conducted a screening over the phone to assess eligibility  \nOtherwise  reasons why they do not want to participate were asked simply  Eligible \nparticipants were mailed a questionnaire and consent form and were asked to return them in \nan enclosed prepaid envelope within 3 weeks  If survivors had not returned the survey after \nthe third follow-up phone call  they were considered non-respondents \n\nAdditionally  community-based recruitment approaches were employed to identify more \nChinese- and Korean-American BCS  For Chinese-Americans  participants were recruited \nthrough community organizations and support groups where the principal investigator  PI  \nhas well-developed  strong  and mutual trusting relationships  Korean-American participants \nwere drawn from local LA hospitals  Korean doctors’ offices  support groups  and \ncommunity organizations  The PI has previously collaborated with physicians  nurses  and \nstaff in these agencies and they agreed to serve on a community advisory board as well as \nassist in recruiting Chinese- and Korean-Americans  Recruitment letters indicating study \npurpose  eligibility criteria  procedures  and contact information were mailed directly to \npotential participants by the agency staff to comply with patient privacy and HIPAA \nregulations  Flyers describing the study were also distributed to agencies  Collaborators in \nthe community agencies were involved in recruitment  the development of culturally and \nlinguistically appropriate materials  and the interpretation and dissemination of the findings \n\nRecruitment through newspapers and word of mouth  snowball sampling  was also \nemployed  We identified a variety of events in the Chinese- and Korean-American \ncommunities and sought permission from the organizers to attend and speak briefly about \nour study  We distributed flyers at the events describing the study to potential participants  \nWomen who did not immediately decide to participate received a follow-up telephone call if \nthey provided their contact information \n\nFinally  we directly contacted BCS from our previous studies who indicated an interest in \nparticipating in future research studies  They were recruited mainly through a local hospital \nregistry  community organizations  and support groups \n\nAll study procedures were conducted in the participants’ preferred language  e g  English  \nChinese  or Korean  by ethnically and linguistically matched RAs  Korean and Chinese  \nParticipants received an incentive payment of $40 for completing the survey \n\nLim and Paek Page 4\n\nJ Cancer Educ  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 March 01 \n\nAuthor

\nnumber of participants  Next  we determined the number of individuals who were accessible \n i e  those who were directly contacted by RA  and not accessible and the proportions of \nindividuals who refused to participate  who were ineligible to participate  who agreed to \nparticipate but did not complete the survey  called ‘passive refusal’  and who participated  \nWe then compared the available demographic and medical characteristics of participants and \nthose who were accessible but not participated  We also compared the available variables of \nall participants and non-participants  regardless of accessibility  These comparisons were \nconducted using chi-square and independent sample t-tests  Finally  descriptive statistics  \nsuch as the mean and standard deviation  were used to describe the study samples  \nIndependent sample t-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to investigate whether \ndemographic and medical variables varied by ethnicity  The data were analyzed using SPSS \n20 0 \n\nRESULTS\nOf the 619 potential participants to whom recruitment letters were mailed  535 Chinese- and \nKorean-American BCS  86 4%  were identified from the California CSP and hospital \nregistries  An additional 13 6% of participants were recruited from previous studies  n=63  \npublic events  n=16  and support groups  n=6  Approximately 60% of the total potential \nparticipants were not accessible  n=369  Most did not respond to the letters or follow-up \ntelephone calls  and some were not reachable due to incorrect contact information \n\nA total of 250 potential participants  or 40 4% of participants to whom recruitment letters \nwere mailed  were accessible  This accessible group included 155 Chinese-Americans and \n95 Korean-Americans  approximately 40~41% of potential participants were accessible  \nregardless of ethnicity  Among the accessible Chinese-Americans  19 refused to participate \n 12 3%  10 were not eligible to participate  6 5%  40 agreed to participate but did not \ncomplete the survey  25 8%  and 86 participated  55 5%  Among the accessible Korean-\nAmericans  7 refused to participate  7 4%  1 was not eligible to participate  1 1%  16 \nagreed to participate but did not complete the survey  16 8%  and 71 participated  74 7%  \nThus  a total of 157 BCS  86 Chinese-Americans and 71 Korean-Americans  completed the \nfinal survey  yielding a final response rate of 25 4% of the identified samples and 62 8% of \nthe accessible samples  see Figure 1  More specifically  64 of 399 people who were \nidentified via California CSP  16 0%  37 of 136 people via a local registry  27 2%  and 39 \nof 63 people via previous studies  61 9%  participated in the study  In a community-based \napproach  approximately 77%  17 of 22  completed the final survey \n\nOf individuals who were accessible but did not participate in the study  refusal + \nineligibility + passive refusal  n=93  Chinese-Americans were more likely than Korean-\nAmericans to agree to participate but not complete the survey  whereas Korean-Americans \nwere more likely than Chinese-Americans to refuse to participate in the study  For both \nethnic groups  the most common reasons for refusal were ‘too busy or too painful to recall ’ \nfollowed by ‘not interested ’ ‘too old ’ ‘distrust of the research’

evolve  common clinical indications for \nconventional contrast-enhanced breast MRI currently include supplemental screening for \nhigh-risk women  pre-operative evaluation of breast cancer extent of disease  assessment of \nequivocal findings on standard imaging and/or clinical exam  and evaluation of breast cancer \nresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy \n\nPerhaps the greatest driving force behind the increasingly wide adoption of breast MRI at \nmany centers is its exquisite sensitivity  reported to approach 100%  for breast cancer \ndetection  Multiple studies have shown that conventional contrast-enhanced breast MRI has \nthe highest sensitivity of any imaging modality for breast cancer detection in asymptomatic \nhigh-risk women  5–8  and mammographically and clinically occult additional disease in the \ncontralateral  6  and ipsilateral breast  9  in patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer  \nHowever  a major barrier to wider adoption of this technique for average and intermediate \nrisk patients is its modest specificity due to overlap in the imaging features of benign and \nmalignant lesions  with wide variations in the positive predictive value  PPV  of breast MRI \nreported in the literature  24 to 89%   10 \n\nMRI also has been increasingly been studied as a tool to determine which newly diagnosed \nbreast cancers are likely to respond to pre-surgical  or neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  Several \nearly studies examining the use of MRI to assess early response to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy found that changes in size or volume and enhancement kinetic profiles on \nMRI were associated with favorable responses to therapy  including pathologic complete \nresponse  pCR   11  12  These findings suggested that MRI could be used to optimize \nmedical therapy regimens for each individual  The general superiority of MRI over clinical \nexamination and standard imaging techniques for predicting pCR was suggested in multiple \nsingle center studies  13  14  and confirmed in a large multi-center trial  15  Though \nstandard contrast-enhanced MRI is the most accurate modality for predicting important \nneoadjuvant therapy outcomes  its clinical impact has been limited by its cost and modest \noverall performance in this setting \n\nAlthough MRI is commonly used at many centers to further evaluate equivocally suspicious \nclinical or imaging findings  several obstacles have limited application of MRI in this \nclinical setting  Barriers to cost-effective implementation of MRI to reduce unnecessary \nbiopsies prompted by conventional imaging or clinical exam include the relatively low cost \nassociated with image-guided biopsies  which are highly accurate and safe  compared with \nserial imaging  16  and the high negative predictive value  NPV   ~98%  needed to obviate \nthe biopsy of a suspicious finding based on current American College of Radiology  ACR  \nBreast Imaging Reporting and Data System  BI-RADS  guidelines  17  Early studies have \ndemonstrated that the NPV of MRI for this clinical indication ranges from 76% for further \nevaluation of suspicious mammographic calcifications  18  to 85% in the setting of any \nsuspicious mammographic or clinical finding  19  Studies from our institution found that \nwhile breast MRI has high sensitivity and high NPV for this clinical indication  the added \nbreast cancer yield was too low to routinely recommend breast MRI for problem solving \n 20  More recently  Strobel et al found that suspicious  BI-RADS category 4  findings \nidentified on screening mammography or ultrasound that were further evaluated using \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 2\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 February 01 \n\nAuthor

sonographic findings and mammographic findings that did not \ninclude lesions comprised entirely of calcifications  21 \n\nThe basis for the strong clinical performance of conventional breast MRI has been through \nutilization of an imaging approach that emphasizes anatomic and morphologic detail through \nhigh spatial resolution and limited temporal resolution dynamic contrast enhanced  DCE-\nMRI  technique  This approach provides limited insight on physiologic features of breast \ntissue and pathology through the measurement of semi-quantitative kinetic features  While \nthese basic kinetic enhancement features  including peak initial phase and delayed phase \ncurve descriptors  have shown some ability to distinguish between malignant and benign \nlesions  22  they in general have provided a small incremental value to standard \nmorphological descriptions  19  As a result  there is increasing interest in exploring whether \nmultiparametric approaches to breast MRI that incorporate more highly quantitative \npharmacokinetic DCE-MRI modeling and other functional MRI techniques  such as \ndiffusion weighted imaging  DWI  and magnetic resonance spectroscopy  MRS  to probe \nspecific biological properties such as abnormal vessel permeability  cellularity  and chemical \ncomposition  can further advance the use of MRI for these specific clinical settings \n\nBreast MRI Parameters\nThere is no single way to achieve high quality breast MRI  and this is particularly true when \nconsidering a multiparametric approach to MRI acquisition  Nonetheless  MRI should \ninclude an acquisition utilizing a high field  B0  magnet  ≥1 5T  that is bilateral with \ncomplete breast and axilla coverage  Only dedicated breast surface coils are appropriate for \nbreast MRI applications  as the built-in body coil cannot provide enough signal-to-noise \n SNR  for high quality breast imaging \n\nDynamic Contrast Enhanced  DCE  MRI\nCurrently  a DCE-MRI acquisition is central to breast MRI protocols  and the ACR Breast \nMRI Accreditation Program  BMRAP  mandates that a multiphase T1-weighted acquisition \nbe performed for clinical breast MRI  Due to time and technical restraints  DCE-MRI \nprotocols generally emphasize either high spatial resolution and full coverage or high \ntemporal resolution in imaging of contrast uptake kinetics in breast  However  more \nsophisticated acquisition strategies that “under-sample” the periphery of k space on \nsubsequent dynamic acquisitions and more frequently sample the center of k space can \nprovide simultaneous high spatial  high temporal resolution acquisitions with full bilateral \ncoverage  23–25   Fig  1  There is wide variation among centers on the number of post-\ncontrast phases acquired  The ACR BMRAP requires acquisition of a minimum of two post \ncontrast T1 weighted images  with the first post-contrast sequence acquired within 4 minutes \nof contrast injection  DCE-MRI acquisition provides two primary imaging features that can \nbe used to evaluate breast lesions  morphology and kinetic enhancement characteristics \n\nMorphology—There are three general morphologic descriptors of enhancing findings of \nthe breast  which are defined by the ACR BI-RADS atlas  foci  masses  and non-mass \nenhancement  NME  Masses and NMEs also have additional descriptors that can further

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nrefine an interpreting radiologist’s suspicion for malignancy  Prior studies have shown that \nmorphologic features are perhaps the most important factor for initial assessment of \nlikelihood of malignancy of a given lesion  19  Suspicious morphologic features for masses \ninclude irregular shape  heterogeneous or rim internal enhancement  and irregular or \nspiculated margins  Suspicious NME morphologic features include segmental or linear \ndistribution with heterogeneous or clustered ring enhancement  Breast cancers that present \nas NME are more likely to reflect in situ carcinoma than masses  however  significant \noverlap exists in morphologic presentation on MRI of invasive breast cancer  ductal \ncarcinoma in situ  and atypical/high-risk lesions \n\nDCE kinetic enhancement features—Differential enhancement of malignancies \nrelative to normal breast tissue is based on the fact that malignancies typically recruit \nabnormal new blood vessels to support their growth  i e  angiogenesis  The rate at which \nthese abnormal vessels allow nutrients to spill into a tumor and the rate cell cycle byproducts \nare removed from a tumor can be characterized through assessing kinetic enhancement \ncurves obtained from DCE-MRI  Most commonly  breast kinetic enhancement features are \nmeasured semi-quantitatively using modest temporal resolution with at least two to three \npost-contrast T1-weighted acquisitions  with k-space centered at approximately 90 to 120 \nseconds after contrast injection for the first post-contrast images  Using the data obtained at \neach of these time points  a time-signal intensity curve can be determined for a given lesion \nor region of interest  ROI  allowing assessment of two phases of enhancement  initial \nphase  within approximately two minutes of contrast injection  and late  or delayed  phase  \nafter two minutes or after peak enhancement  Fig  2  In the initial phase  enhancement \nclassifications of “slow”  “medium”  and “fast” are determined by signal intensity increase \ndefined by the equation \n\nwhere SIpre is the baseline signal intensity of a region of interest and SIpost is the signal \nintensity of the same region of interest after contrast injection  In the delayed phase  \nenhancement curves can be classified by three basic curve types  persistent  plateau  and \nwashout  Persistent delayed enhancement is generally considered to be a benign \nenhancement curve type  while plateau delayed enhancement is of intermediate suspicion for \nmalignancy and washout delayed enhancement is the most suggestive of malignancy  \nAlthough the most classic combined curve type for malignant breast lesions is fast initial \nenhancement followed by early washout  sometimes referred to as a type III curve  26  \nthere is significant overlap of semi-quantitative kinetic curve types among benign and \nmalignant lesions \n\nMRI techniques that acquire post contrast images with high temporal resolution can allow \nfor more elegant assessment of contrast kinetics through pharmacokinetic modeling \ntechniques  Pharmacokinetic models enable quantitative assessments of contrast agent \nexchange between the intravascular and the interstitial space  providing measures related to \ntumor blood flow  microvasculature  and capillary permeability  A two-compartment model \nis the most commonly used approach  measuring the exchange of contrast between tissue  in \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 4\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am

and was first proposed in an MRI-context by \nTofts and Kermode  27  The concentrations of the gadolinium tracer for each compartment \nvary with time after the bolus injection of the contrast agent  and quantitative metrics can be \nmeasured by this model using the following relationship\n\nwhere the volume transfer constant Ktrans reflects the rate of transfer of gadolinium from \nplasma to the tissue  units  min−1   Fig  1D  the transfer rate constant kep  min−1  reflects \nthe reflux of contrast agent from the extravascular extracellular space to the plasma \ncompartment  and ve  %  reflects the leakage of fractional volume from the extravascular \nextracellular space into the plasma compartment \n\nPromising clinical applications of quantitative DCE MRI—Multiple authors have \ndemonstrated that some of these pharmacokinetic parameters  particularly Ktrans and kep  \nhold value for improved discrimination of malignant from benign breast pathologies  and \nmay even be used as biomarkers of disease subtypes  Li and colleagues demonstrated that \nKtrans and kep values progressively increased when measuring normal glands  benign \nlesions  and malignant lesions  respectively  noting that invasive ductal carcinomas and \nductal carcinoma in situ lesions exhibited significantly higher Ktrans and kep values than \nductal dysplasias  28  Huang et al demonstrated that using Ktrans values of lesions found to \nbe suspicious on standard clinical breast MRI  a potential “cutoff” value could be used such \nthat lesions with lower Ktrans values could avoid biopsy and thereby decrease false positive \nMR examinations  29  Finally  DCE-MRI holds potential for assessing alterations in tumor \nperfusion in response to preoperative therapies  Fig 3  Ktrans values have been shown in a \nrecent meta-analysis to be among the most promising MRI parameters for prediction of near \npathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  outperforming standard tumor \nsize measurements  30 \n\nTechnical challenges and considerations of quantitative DCE-MRI—In order to \nperform DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic modeling and calculate quantitative parameters  \nknowledge of both the pre-contrast T1 relaxation times of the tumor or tissue being imaged \nand the arterial input function  AIF  or the concentration of contrast agent as it changes \nover time within the arterial blood  is required  Measuring each of these parameters \nintroduces unique challenges and potential for error  Pre-contrast T1 mapping is an essential \nstep to convert DCE-MRI signal intensity into contrast agent concentration  T1 mapping \nrequires acquisition of an additional series of images prior to DCE MRI  most commonly \nusing varying flip angle or inversion recovery approaches  and thus adds to the overall \nexamination times  Moreover  variable flip angle approaches are prone to inaccuracies due \nto B1 inhomogeneity  a common issue for breast imaging  particularly at higher field \nstrengths  31  Most models require that the AIF be measured directly for each subject  32  \nwhich is often challenging to perform and necessitates acquisition tradeoffs  in coverage \nand/or spatial resolution  to achieve the very high temporal resolution required to accurately \nsample the rapidly changing AIF  Furthermore  AIF measures can be very sensitive to

M\nanuscript\n\n\n\npatient motion between dynamic acquisitions  One common approach to avoid the challenge \nof directly calculating the AIF is to employ an average AIF calculated from a larger \npopulation for whom the injection site  dose  and rate were kept constant  29  Yankeelov et \nal have proposed another method to circumvent this problem by estimating the AIF using a \nreference region model  and found that such an approach correlated well with direct AIF \nmeasurement  33  Novel high spatiotemporal DCE-MRI acquisition strategies  as described \nearlier  hold potential to provide high temporal resolution sampling of contrast enhancement \ncurves without undesirable tradeoffs in spatial resolution and coverage  which may improve \nfeasibility for utilization of pharmacokinetic analysis in clinical breast applications  25 \n\nTheoretically  model-based pharmacokinetic parameters have the advantage over semi-\nquantitative enhancement curve assessments of being objective measures of underlying \nphysiology that are not affected by variability in scan parameters  However  given the \ndifferent modeling algorithms  multiple challenges and varying potential solutions  each of \nwhich can create significant differences in quantitative measurements  the generalizability of \nindividual studies of advanced pharmacokinetic parameters will require standardization of \nthe technical approach and multicenter testing  34 \n\nDiffusion Weighted MRI  DWI \nDWI is a non-contrast MRI technique that measures the mobility of water molecules in vivo \nand probes tissue organization at the microscopic level  This water movement due to \nmolecular diffusion  called Brownian motion  is random in pure water  However  the motion \nof water molecules in vivo is restricted by hindrances within intracellular and extracellular \ncompartments  As a result  DWI reflects the microscopic cellular environment and is \nsensitive to biophysical characteristics such as cell density  membrane integrity  and \nmicrostructure \n\nDWI has shown promise for the detection and characterization of breast cancer  35  \nNumerous studies have shown that malignant breast lesions exhibit decreased water \ndiffusion  attributed primarily to the increased cell density associated with breast tumors \n 36  DWI is a short scan available on most commercial MR scanners that does not require \nany exogenous contrast and can be added to breast MR imaging examinations to provide \nadditional unique information on tissue microstructural properties \n\nApparent diffusion coefficient  ADC  calculation—DWI utilizes motion-sensitizing \ngradients during MR image acquisition to probe local diffusion characteristics  The \ndiffusion-weighted MRI signal is reduced in intensity proportional to the water mobility  and \nis commonly described by the monoexponential equation \n\n 2 \n\nwhere S0 is the signal intensity without diffusion weighting  SD is the signal intensity with \ndiffusion weighting  b is the applied diffusion sensitization  s/mm2  and ADC is the \napparent diffusion coefficient  defined as the average area a water molecule occupies per \nunit time  mm2/s   37  In general  ADC can be calculated directly from a minimum of two \nacquisitions with different b-values using \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 6\n\nMagn Reson

minimum b-value  eg  0 s/mm2  and b2 is the maximum b-value  e g  800 \ns/mm2  S1 is the signal intensity at b = b1  S2 is the signal intensity at b = b2  and repetition \ntime  TR  and echo time  TE  remain constant  38  Due to restricted diffusion  breast \nmalignancies commonly exhibit hyperintensity on DWI and lower ADC relative to normal \nbreast parenchyma  Fig 4 \n\nPromising clinical applications of breast DWI—DWI holds strong potential as an \nadjunct MRI technique to reduce false positives and unnecessary biopsies  This has been the \nmost widely explored application of DWI for breast imaging  and numerous groups have \ndemonstrated restricted water diffusion in breast malignancies and significant differences in \nADC values of benign and malignant lesions  36  39–41   Figs  5  6 and 7  A meta-analysis \nof 13 studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of DWI in 964 breast lesions  615 \nmalignant  349 benign  reported a pooled sensitivity of 84%  95% confidence interval [CI]  \n82%  87%  and specificity of 79%  95% CI  75%  82%  ADC values for malignancies \nranged from 0 87 to 1 36 ×10−3 mm2/s  and recommended threshold ADC cutoffs to \ndiscriminate benign and malignant lesions varied from 0 90 to 1 76 ×10−3 mm2/s  with \n10/13 studies using a maximum b value of 1000 s/mm2   42  Further  multiple studies \nacross a variety of field strengths have found that ADC measures are complementary to \nDCE-MRI parameters for discriminating benign and malignant breast lesions and can \nincrease the accuracy of conventional breast MRI assessment  43–46 \n\nAnother promising application for DWI is in monitoring of breast cancer treatment  \nAlterations in cell membrane integrity and reduced tumor cellularity due to cytotoxic effects \nof chemotherapy result in increased water mobility within the damaged tumor tissue  A \ncorresponding increase in tumor ADC in response to treatment may be detectable earlier \nthan changes in tumor size or vascularity as measured by DCE-MRI  suggesting DWI may \nprovide valuable early indication of treatment efficacy  47  48  In a recent study of 118 \nwomen undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer  Richard \net al found that pretreatment tumor ADC values differed between intrinsic subtypes and \nwere predictive of pathological response in triple-negative tumors  49 \n\nDWI may also offer a viable non-contrast method of breast MR screening  Many \nmammographically and clinically occult breast cancers detected by DCE-MRI are also \nvisible on DWI  and can be differentiated from benign breast lesions based on ADC  50  In \none study of asymptomatic women  DWI provided higher accuracy than screening \nmammography for the detection of breast malignancies  51  The potential of DWI as a non-\ncontrast alternative for breast MR screening has only been explored in a handful of studies \nand requires further investigation \n\nTechnical challenges of breast DWI—Although a growing number of imaging centers \nare incorporating DWI into the clinical breast MR examination  several factors currently \nlimit widespread clinical implementation  35  The techniques used to acquire DW images \nof the breast  including the choice of b-values  vary considerably across studies in the \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 7\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am  Author

quality of breast DWI due to the particular \nchallenges of off-isocenter imaging  air-tissue interfaces  and significant fat content in the \nbreast  Complete fat suppression is necessary to avoid detrimental chemical shift artifacts in \necho planar DWI and confounding effects of residual intravoxel fat signal on breast tissue \nADC measures  52  Furthermore  differences in data analysis approaches including post-\nprocessing  ADC calculation  and region-of-interest methods result in considerable \ndifferences in the reported ADC values of similar breast pathologies  This lack of \nstandardization in image acquisition and post-processing methods makes it difficult to define \ngeneralizable interpretation strategies for breast DWI and to reliably assess the clinical \nutility of the technique \n\nAdvanced methods of breast DWI—A number of compelling advancements in DWI \nacquisition strategies are under development to overcome the technical issues of spatial \ndistortion and low resolution that currently prevent direct correlation and one-to-one \nmapping of DCE-MRI and DWI features and limit clinical implementation of breast DWI \n 53–56  Furthermore  advanced modeling approaches are also being investigated to extract \nmore valuable biological information from breast DWI scans  These include intravoxel \nincoherent motion  IVIM  modeling  which provides characterization of tissue perfusion in \naddition to diffusion  57–60  diffusion kurtosis modeling  which characterizes deviation \nfrom unrestricted diffusion behavior  evident in vivo at high b-values >1500 s/mm2  and \naccounts for ‘tissue complexity’ or physical barriers to diffusion within tissue  cell \nmembranes  organelles  stromal desmoplasia  etc   58  61  and diffusion tensor imaging \n DTI  which characterizes the directionality of water diffusion in addition to the rate and \nmay provide further insights on glandular organization  ducts  lobules  and \nmicroarchitecture  62–64 \n\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy  MRS  is a noninvasive technique that reflects the \nchemical composition of tissue  Rather than images  MRS techniques produce spatially-\nlocalized signal spectra  with spectral peaks representing the structure and concentration of \ndifferent chemical compounds in that region  MRS can differentiate tissue states such as \nnormal  malignant  necrotic  or hypoxic based on varying levels of associated detectable \nmetabolites  Proton MRS studies of the breast have demonstrated highly elevated levels of \nthe metabolite choline in malignant lesions compared with benign lesions and normal breast \ntissue  65–68  The choline peak observed in vivo  located at approximately 3 2 ppm  \nactually represents a composite of several different choline-containing compounds \n including free choline  phosphocoline and glycerophosphocholine  resolvable using ex vivo \nmethods  69  and is typically referred to as ‘total choline’  tCho  Choline is known to be \ninvolved in cell membrane turnover  phospholipid synthesis and degradation  and is \ntherefore generally considered a marker of cell proliferation  While the underlying \nbiochemical process is not yet well-understood  elevated choline signal in malignancies is \nthought to result from a combination of both increased intracellular phosphocholine \nconcentration and increased cell density in the lesion  69  70 \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page 8\n\nMagn Reson Imaging Clin N Am  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 February 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nTechniques for acquisition and analysis of breast MRS have been reviewed extensively in a \nrecent article by Bolan  71  In general  single voxel MRS is the most widely used \nacquisition approach  which produces a single spatially localized spectrum representing the \naverage chemical signal from a 3-dimensional cuboid volume  voxel  centered within a \nlesion identified on contrast-enhanced MRI  Fig  8  Some manufacturers currently offer \nsingle voxel protocols specifically optimized for breast MRS  An alternative localization \ntechnique is chemical-shift imaging  CSI  or MR spectroscopic imaging  MRSI  in which a \nlarger volume is excited and 2D or 3D phase encoding is used to produce a spatially \nresolved grid of spectra  Breast MRS analysis centers on evaluation of the tCho signal  and \nhas been performed using a variety of approaches that can be generally categorized as  1  \nqualitative - detection of the presence of a tCho peak   2  semi-quantitative – measurement \nof tCho SNR  peak height or peak integral  or  3  absolute quantification – calculation of \ntCho concentration  using internal referencing to unsuppressed water signal or external \nreferencing to a phantom with a known chemical concentration   71 \n\nPromising clinical applications of breast MRS—MRS may help to improve the \naccuracy of diagnosing suspicious breast lesions on MRI  1H-MRS measures of choline \nlevels in suspicious breast lesions have been shown to provide high specificity for \ndistinguishing benign from malignant lesions  72–74  The majority of breast MRS studies \nto date have been performed at 1 5T using single voxel approaches  In a recent meta-\nanalysis of 19 breast MRS studies including 1198 lesions  773 malignant  452 benign  \nBaltzer and Dietzel found a pooled sensitivity of 73%  95% CI  85%  91%  and specificity \nof 88%  95% CI  64%  82%  for lesion diagnosis  75  Their analysis did not show any \nsignificant performance advantages of 3T over 1 5T field strength or MRSI over single \nvoxel techniques  or qualitative over quantitative tCho assessments  although the numbers of \nstudies using 3T  n=2/19  and MRSI  n=3/19  were small  More recently  Pinker et al have \nreported a high diagnostic accuracy for assessing suspicious breast lesions using a \nmultiparametric MRI breast examination incorporating MRSI  76 \n\nWhereas simple qualitative detection of the presence of a tCho peak was a reliable marker of \nmalignancy in earlier investigations  77  newer approaches using higher field strengths and \nhigher sensitivity breast coil designs require more quantitative diagnostic methods because \ncholine also becomes detectable even in normal breast tissue at higher SNR levels  71  78  \nA threshold of tCho SNR > 2 is a commonly used threshold for malignancy in prior studies \n\nBreast MRS may play a valuable role in assessing response to neoadjuvant therapy  Breast \ntumor choline levels may reflect treatment-induced alterations in cell proliferation prior to \nany changes in tumor size and thus provide an early predictive marker of treatment response  \nIn support of this  Meisamy and colleagues  70  79  found acute decreases in tumor tCho \nconcentration were measurable at 4T as early as 24 hours after the first-dose of \nchemotherapy and correlated with final changes in tumor size  In a large study of 184 \npatients with breast cancer  Shin et al further showed that tumor tCho measures were higher \nin invasive versus in situ cancers  and correlated with several prognostic factors including \nnuclear grade  histologic grade  and estrogen receptor  ER  status  80 \n\nRahbar and Partridge Page

challenges of breast MRS—There are several challenges to routine clinical \nuse of MRS of the breast  As with breast DWI  high quality shimming and lipid suppression \nare critical for successful breast MRS  Poor shimming results in B0 field inhomogeneities \nthat broaden spectral line widths  causing reduced SNR and a reduced ability to separate \ndifferent chemical resonances  and may also compromise the performance of chemically \nselective fat and water suppression in localized MRS  Shimming can be especially \nchallenging in the breast with regions of mixed fibroglandular and adipose tissues and in the \npresence of metallic biopsy clips  Without adequate fat suppression  lipid sidebands can \nobscure choline peaks in the spectra  A variety of fat suppression strategies have been used \nacross prior breast MRS studies and there is no clear consensus on the optimal method  71  \n75 \n\nA major limitation of breast MRS with current approaches is low sensitivity for detecting \ncholine levels in smaller lesions   100% classified as slow  \nmedium  and fast  respectively  The delayed phase is classified by the curve type after initial \npeak enhancement as persistent

breast reconstruction is increasingly performed at the time of \nmastectomy  Few studies have examined whether breast reconstruction impacts development of \nlymphedema \n\nMethods—616 breast cancer patients who underwent 891 mastectomies between 2005–2013 \nwere prospectively screened for lymphedema at our institution  with 22 2 months median follow-\nup  Mastectomies were categorized as immediate implant  immediate autologous  or no \nreconstruction  Arm measurements were performed pre-operatively and during post-operative \nfollow-up using a Perometer  Lymphedema was defined as ≥10% arm volume increase compared \nto pre-operative  Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine \nlymphedema rates and risk factors \n\nResults—Of 891 mastectomies  65%  580/891  had immediate implant  11%  101/891  \nimmediate autologous  and 24%  210/891  no reconstruction  The two-year cumulative incidence \nof lymphedema was  4 08%  95% CI  2 59–6 41%  implant  9 89%  95% CI  4 98–19 1%  \nautologous  and 26 7%  95% CI  20 4–34 4%  no reconstruction  By multivariate analysis  \nimmediate implant  HR  0 352  p 20% following axillary lymph node dissection  ALND  and \n3 5–11% after sentinel lymph node biopsy  SLNB 6–11\n\nRecent trends have demonstrated an increase in the number of patients who opt for \nimmediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy 12 13 Immediate breast \nreconstruction has been shown to improve body image  psychological well-being  and \noverall quality of life in breast cancer patients 14–18 Numerous studies have demonstrated \nthe oncologic safety of immediate breast reconstruction for patients with invasive breast \ncancer 19–21 and some argue that immediate compared with delayed breast reconstruction \noffers superior aesthetic and psychosocial benefits 22–24\n\nCommonly cited risk factors for lymphedema include ALND and higher Body Mass Index \n BMI  or obesity  with mastectomy occasionally cited as a risk factor 1 6 8–10 25–37 In \naddition  several studies have shown that delayed autologous breast reconstruction may \nreduce the severity of existing post-mastectomy lymphedema resulting from a prior \nmodified radical mastectomy  Until recently  there has been little data on the association of \nimmediate breast reconstruction with development of lymphedema after mastectomy  \nFindings from recent studies suggest that immediate breast reconstruction may be associated \nwith a reduced risk of post-mastectomy lymphedema 38–40 However  most studies were \nconducted retrospectively and utilized non-standardized methods of measuring and defining \nlymphedema \n\nIn this study  we sought to determine the risk of lymphedema associated with immediate \nbreast reconstruction compared to mastectomy alone  We evaluated rates of lymphedema in \npatients prospectively screened for the condition at our institution who underwent \nmastectomy with immediate implant  immediate autologous  or no reconstruction  \nMultivariate regression was utilized to identify independent risk factors for lymphedema \n\nMiller et al  Page 2\n\nAnn Surg  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 February 01

we prospectively obtained \nbilateral arm volume measurements on women diagnosed with breast cancer using a \nPerometer  The Perometer is an optoelectronic system that utilizes infrared light beams to \nmeasure circumference at regular intervals along the limb and calculates volume based on \nthese measurements  Arm volume measurements were obtained pre- and post-operatively  \nduring chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy  and at follow-up oncology visits after \ncompletion of breast cancer treatment  The protocol for lymphedema screening has \npreviously been published 41\n\nFor this study  we utilized a weight-adjusted volume change equation which calculates \nchange in arm volume compared to a pre-operative measurement and accounts for temporal \nchanges in patient weight  which may cause arm size changes unrelated to lymphedema 42 \n\nWeight-adjusted arm volume change  WAC  was calculated for the left and right arm \nindependently at each post-operative assessment according to the formula  WAC = \n A2*W1 / W2*A1  − 1  where A1 is pre-operative arm volume  A2 is arm volume at a post-\noperative assessment  and W1 and W2 are the patient’s weights at these time points  Use of \nthe WAC equation allowed for inclusion of patients who underwent bilateral mastectomy  \nsince arm volume change can be assessed in each arm individually and does not rely on \ncomparison of size between arms  All patients included in this analysis had a pre-operative \nmeasurement and at least one follow-up measurement occurring >3 months after surgery \n\nLymphedema was defined as a measurement with ≥10% WAC  based on consensus in the \nliterature 6 29 43 Measurements recorded within the first 3 months after surgery were not \nutilized for lymphedema assessment  because patients may experience transient increases in \nmeasured arm volume during this period related to post-surgical changes 44 Measurements \nobtained after a patient was diagnosed with distant metastases or local recurrence were \nexcluded to avoid potential confounding factors \n\nPatient Population\n616 patients with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer who underwent 891 mastectomies at \nour institution between 9/2005–2/2013 were included in this analysis  with a median post-\noperative follow-up of 22 2 months  range 3 0–86 9  Each breast was considered \nindividually  and mastectomies were categorized according to type of immediate breast \nreconstruction  implant  immediate tissue expander or immediate direct-to-implant  \ndesignated together as immediate implant  autologous  or no reconstruction  Mastectomies \nwith delayed breast reconstruction were excluded from this analysis  Regional lymph node \nradiation included supraclavicular and/or axillary radiation  Patient demographics  surgical  \nradiation and medical oncology treatments were collected via medical record review to \nanalyze as risk factors \n\nMiller et al  Page 3\n\nAnn Surg  Author manuscript

tissue expander placement with subsequent \nimplant exchange and immediate direct-to-implant  single stage  placement  Tissue \nexpanders were placed with total or partial muscle coverage  with or without acellular \ndermal matrix or vicryl mesh  Expanders were exchanged to implants in a second surgery  If \nthe skin envelope was sufficient at the time of mastectomy  an implant was placed with \npartial muscle coverage and acellular dermal matrix or mesh in one stage 45 Immediate \nautologous reconstruction included Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous  TRAM  \nand Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator  DIEP  flaps  One patient underwent \nautologous reconstruction with a Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery  SIEA  flap  \nOperations were performed at a single institution by 4 breast only surgeons and 5 dedicated \nreconstructive plastic surgeons  The decision regarding whether to perform reconstruction \nand which type of reconstruction to perform was made by a multidisciplinary team based on \npatient anatomy and comorbidities  concomitant therapy  and patient preference \n\nStatistical Analysis\nUnivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate risk \nfactors for lymphedema  Time-dependent covariates were included for use of systemic \ntherapies and radiation fields such that cases were included in the unexposed group prior to \ninitiation of a given treatment and then were included in the exposed group after treatment  \nRegression parameters in the Cox models were estimated using a robust sandwich \ncovariance matrix estimate to account for the correlation induced by including data from \nboth sides for patients who had bilateral mastectomies 46 Multivariate models were derived \nusing backwards selection  starting with a model that included all variables that were \nsignificant  p 2cm or >5cm compared to a pre-operative measurement  and was also subjectively \nevaluated utilizing a lymphedema symptoms questionnaire  The authors found that after \nadjusting for age  BMI  and post-operative weight gain  patients who underwent tissue \nexpander reconstruction had a significant reduction in risk of lymphedema \n\nA 2012 study by Card et al retrospectively evaluated 574 matched patients who underwent \nmastectomy alone or with reconstruction using tissue expanders  lattisimus dorsi flap with \nimplants  or autologous tissue transfer 38 The authors found that patients without \nreconstruction were significantly more likely to develop lymphedema by multivariate \n\nMiller et

0001  after matching patients on age  axillary radiation  and type of \naxillary surgery  Patients did not undergo a pre-operative arm measurement  and were \nevaluated for lymphedema in a non-standardized manner based on clinical assessment and \nconfirmation with measurements not clearly defined in the manuscript  A letter to the editor \nresponding to this manuscript suggested the potential for under-diagnosis of lymphedema \ndue to subjective evaluation at irregular intervals  and cited the need for objective \nmeasurement data from centers with consecutive lymphedema information 56\n\nMost recently  Lee et al retrospectively evaluated the impact of immediate autologous \nreconstruction on lymphedema risk in 712 patients who underwent modified radical \nmastectomy 40 Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of \nlymphedema in patients who underwent immediate autologous reconstruction compared to \nmastectomy alone  OR=0 461  p=0 023  However  as with the study by Card et al  patients \nin this series did not undergo a pre-operative measurement  and were evaluated for \nlymphedema in a non-standardized manner based on clinician assessment and confirmation \nwith the Perometer \n\nIn our series  immediate implant but not autologous reconstruction was associated with a \nsignificantly reduced risk of lymphedema compared to mastectomy alone by multivariate \nanalysis  Importantly  our multivariate analysis adjusted for known lymphedema risk factors \nincluding ALND  BMI  number of lymph nodes dissected  and radiation therapy  which \nwere not evenly distributed amongst the reconstruction and no reconstruction \ngroups 1 6 8–10 25–37 57–63 Indeed  ALND  higher BMI at surgery  and greater number of \nlymph nodes dissected were significantly associated with increased risk of developing \nlymphedema by multivariate analysis  These factors have all been shown to increase \nlymphedema risk in previous studies 6 29\n\nThere exist a number of possible explanations for our finding that immediate implant \nreconstruction is associated with reduced lymphedema risk  Patients undergoing immediate \nreconstruction typically have skin-sparing mastectomies  which preserves more of the skin \nenvelope and therefore lymphatic channels under the skin  whereas patients without \nreconstruction undergo more resection of breast and axillary skin for optimal healing and \ncosmesis  Perhaps more importantly  patients who undergo mastectomy without \nreconstruction may experience tissue adhesion  fibrosis  and contracture of the breast skin  \nchest wall  and axilla  resulting in obstructed lymphatic flow and possibly lymphedema \ndevelopment 40 Yet another theory suggests a role for tissue ischemia in lymphedema \nprevention  Tissue expansion and capsular contracture from implant reconstruction may \ninduce tissue ischemia and lead to increased expression of vascular endothelial growth \nfactor  resulting in tissue angiogenesis and possibly lymphangiogenesis 64 Card et al propose \nthat continued ischemia and capsular contracture from implant reconstruction may help \nprevent lymphedema development 38\n\nDespite findings from studies demonstrating that delayed autologous breast reconstruction \nmay improve existing lymphedema  we did not find immediate autologous breast \nreconstruction to reduce risk of lymphedema in our series  This is in contrast with findings \nfrom Lee et al  who hypothesized that transferred skin flaps could reduce post-operative \n\nMiller et al  Page 7\n\nAnn Surg  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 February 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nfibrosis  contracture  and adhesion in the chest wall and axilla  and could contribute to \nreduced lymphatic obstruction 40 The relatively small number of patients in our series with \nimmediate autologous breast reconstruction  n=101  may account for our findings  as \ndemonstrated by the large confidence interval for cumulative lymphedema incidence \n\nAdditional explanations for the association of reduced lymphedema risk with immediate \nbreast reconstruction include the positive impacts of reconstruction  and uncontrolled-for \nconfounding  A recent study by McCarthy et al demonstrated that women who underwent \nimmediate autologous or implant reconstruction following mastectomy experienced less \nchronic physical morbidity compared with those who underwent mastectomy alone  which \ncould contribute to reduced long-term risk of lymphedema resulting from increased upper \nextremity use with breast reconstruction 65 Another possibility is confounding caused by \nfactors not accounted for in the multivariate model  resulting in a lower risk of lymphedema \nin patients who underwent reconstruction despite adjustment for known risk factors  In our \nseries  patients in the no reconstruction group were more likely to undergo ALND  radiation \ntherapy  have BMI ≥30  and have more lymph nodes dissected  all of which are known risk \nfactors but were adjusted for in the multivariate model \n\nOur study has a number of limitations  including the non-randomized selection of patients \nfor immediate reconstruction versus mastectomy alone  There were significant differences in \nthe distribution of risk factors for lymphedema among patients in the reconstruction and no \nreconstruction groups  which could at least partially account for our findings despite \nadjustment in the multivariate model  A greater proportion of patients in the no \nreconstruction group had stage IIb or stage III breast cancer compared with the immediate \nreconstruction groups  thus it is possible that the combination of extent of surgical \nprocedure  radiation therapy  and receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy could have enhanced \nthe risk of lymphedema in the no reconstruction group  However  we did adjust for post-\nmastectomy radiation and receipt of chemotherapy  which were not significant on \nmultivariate analysis  Of note  exclusion of mastectomies for inflammatory  T4d  breast \ncancer and with matted axillary lymph nodes  cN2  which may be at higher risk for \nlymphedema due to more aggressive surgery and are not usually accompanied by \nreconstruction  did not affect our findings  Owing to these limitations  further research is \nwarranted regarding the association of lymphedema with breast reconstruction and a \npossible mechanism by which immediate breast reconstruction may reduce the risk of \nlymphedema \n\nStrengths of this study include use of a large cohort of patients prospectively screened for \nlymphedema with objective arm volume measurements occurring pre-operatively and at \nregular intervals throughout breast cancer treatment and follow-up  Arm volumes were \nmeasured using the Perometer  a device with demonstrated validity for lymphedema \nassessment 66 67 To our knowledge  this cohort of 891 mastectomies  from 616 patients  \nrepresents one of the largest series in the literature on lymphedema  and certainly the largest \nin which risk of lymphedema was prospectively evaluated for association with immediate \nbreast reconstruction  Patients included in our study underwent pre-operative and regular \npost-operative measurements  with a median follow-up of almost two years  We objectively \nquantified lymphedema using the validated WAC equation  which incorporates fluctuations \n\nMiller

account for arm size changes unrelated to lymphedema 42 The \nimportance of obtaining pre-operative assessments to account for asymmetry between arms \nand adjustment for factors unrelated to lymphedema has been previously \ndemonstrated 41 68 69\n\nIn conclusion  multivariate analysis of 891 mastectomies from patients prospectively \nscreened for lymphedema demonstrated a reduced risk of lymphedema with immediate \nimplant reconstruction compared to mastectomy alone  in patients for whom implant-based \nreconstruction was available  The mechanism by which immediate implant reconstruction \nmay reduce lymphedema risk is not known  however  further research may offer novel \ntreatment strategies for mastectomy patients  Furthermore  these findings can be utilized for \npatient counseling regarding reconstructive options following mastectomy \n\nAcknowledgments\nSources of funding  The study described was supported by Award Number R01CA139118  AGT  Award Number

Access\n\nA nested cohort study of 6 248 early breast\ncancer patients treated in neoadjuvant and\nadjuvant chemotherapy trials investigating\nthe prognostic value of chemotherapy-\nrelated toxicities\nJean E  Abraham1 2 3 5*†  Louise Hiller6*†  Leila Dorling3†  Anne-Laure Vallier4 5  Janet Dunn6  Sarah Bowden7 \nSusan Ingle1 2 4  Linda Jones1 2 5  Richard Hardy1 2 4  Christopher Twelves9  Christopher J  Poole6  Paul D P Pharoah3 \nCarlos Caldas1 2 5 8 and Helena M  Earl1 2 5\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground  The relationship between chemotherapy-related toxicities and prognosis is unclear  Previous studies\nhave examined the association of myelosuppression parameters or neuropathy with survival and reported conflicting\nresults  This study aims to investigate 13 common chemotherapy toxicities and their association with relapse-free\nsurvival and breast cancer-specific survival \n\nMethods  Chemotherapy-related toxicities were collected prospectively for 6 248 women with early-stage breast\ncancer from four randomised controlled trials  NEAT  BR9601  tAnGo  Neo-tAnGo  Cox proportional-hazards modelling\nwas used to analyse the association between chemotherapy-related toxicities and both breast cancer-specific survival\nand relapse-free survival  Models included important prognostic factors and stratified by variables violating the\nproportional hazards assumption \n\nResults  Multivariable analysis identified severe neutropenia  grades ≥3  as an independent predictor of relapse-free\nsurvival  hazard ratio  HR  = 0 86  95 % confidence interval  CI  0 76–0 97  P = 0 02  A similar trend was seen for breast\ncancer-specific survival  HR = 0 87  95 % CI  0 75–1 01  P = 0 06  Normal/low BMI patients experienced more severe\nneutropenia  P = 0 008  than patients with higher BMI  Patients with fatigue  grades ≥3  showed a trend towards reduced\nsurvival  breast cancer-specific survival  HR = 1 17  95 % CI  0 99–1 37  P = 0 06  In the NEAT/BR9601 sub-group analysis by\ntreatment component  this effect was statistically significant  HR = 1 61  95 % CI  1 13–2 30  P = 0 009 \n\nConclusions  This large study shows a significant association between chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and\nincreased survival  It also identifies a strong relationship between low/normal BMI and increased incidence of\nsevere neutropenia  It provides evidence to support the development of neutropenia-adapted clinical trials to\ninvestigate optimal dose calculation and its impact on clinical outcome  This is important in populations where\nobesity may lead to sub-optimal chemotherapy doses \n\nKeywords  Adverse events  Breast cancer  Chemotherapy  Prognosis  Survival  Toxicity\n\n* Correspondence  ja344@medschl cam ac

cancers  For each CRT \nmultiple factors contribute to their development  including\npharmacogenetic and co-morbidity factors [1]  The rela-\ntionship between the occurrence of various CRTs and sub-\nsequent survival has been investigated in relatively small\ncohorts in multiple tumour types with conflicting results \nA CRT may be a proxy pharmacokinetic parameter  indi-\ncating the level of drug exposure  dose density delivered\nand/or metabolic activity  or it may be a proxy pharmaco-\ndynamic parameter that reflects the sensitivity and suscep-\ntibility of different tissues to chemotherapy \nMany studies in different tumour types have investi-\n\ngated the association between survival and measures of\nmyelosuppression  Eskander et al  [2] reviewed seven\nbreast cancer studies with inter-study heterogeneity in\ntrial design and varying toxicities  including leukocyte\nnadir  myelosuppression and neutropenia  The largest\nstudy [3]  n = 750  showed that patients with grade 2 or\n3 neutropenia  on the National Cancer Institute Com-\nmon Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events  NCI CTCAE \nscale  had a 10 % absolute survival advantage at 5 years\ncompared to those with no neutropenia  multivariable\nP = 0 037  Shitara et al  [4] performed a meta-analysis\nof 13 trials  n = 9 528  considering several different\ntoxicities  varying tumour types  stages of disease  and\nthresholds of NCI CTCAE classification and concluded\nthat neutropenia or leukopenia experienced during\nchemotherapy was associated with improved survival \nThe association between survival and taxane-related\n\nsensory neuropathy in breast cancer patients has been\nexplored previously  Schneider et al  [5] investigated\n4 554 patients from a randomised controlled clinical trial\nand found no significant relationship between neur-\nopathy and disease-free survival  DFS  overall survival \nor relapse-free survival  RFS  However  Moreno-Aspitia\net al  [6] did report an association of taxane-related\nsensory neuropathy with DFS in early stage  taxane-\ntreated  human epidermal growth factor  HER2 -positive\nbreast cancer patients  In ovarian cancer  Lee et al  [7]\nfound that sensory neuropathy secondary to treatment\nwith paclitaxel and carboplatin was associated with im-\nproved progression-free survival  n = 949 \nModerate and/or severe oral mucositis was associ-\n\nated with improved survival in one study [8]  n = 533 \nAnother study associated oral mucositis with an in-\ncreased risk of infection and an adverse impact on\nsurvival [9] \nAlthough there is considerable data on the impact of\n\nfatigue on quality of life [10  11] in early stage breast\ncancer  there is no published evidence on the prognostic\nsignificance of chemotherapy-induced fatigue in early\nstage disease \n\nWe have investigated the association between 13 com-\nmon CRTs and RFS and breast cancer-specific survival\n BCSS  in patients  n = 6 248  with early stage breast\ncancer using data from randomised controlled trials with\nprospective protocol-driven collection of CRTs \n\nMethods\nPatients and clinical trials\nClinical data was collected from the UK

neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy  The\nmajority of CRTs were not associated with either RFS or\nBCSS  However  we have demonstrated that severe neu-\ntropenia  grades ≥3  is associated with improved RFS  In\naddition  after re-classification of neutropenia case status\nto grades ≥1  the association with BCSS remains  Previous\nstudies investigating the relationship between neutropenia\nand survival have hypothesised that neutropenia is a re-\nflection of chemotherapy efficacy and activity  This implies\nthat patients who are not achieving neutropenia may also\nnot be receiving an effective or adequately active dose\n[18]  It must be noted that  in this study  13 separate CRTs\nhave been tested against two clinical endpoints of BCSS\nand RFS and  as such  the study findings must be\nconsidered whilst bearing in mind the issue of multiple\ntesting \nPatients with normal or underweight BMI are more\n\nlikely to have severe neutropenia during their treatment\ncourse in comparison to overweight or obese BMI pa-\ntients  P = 0 008  In obese patients  due to an increase\nin the amount of fat contributing to the actual weight\nand potentially changes in blood flow  the pharmaco-\nkinetics of chemotherapy may be affected  This may\naffect volume of distribution  clearance  and  conse-\nquently  patient drug exposure  Thus  overweight or\nobese BMI patients may not be receiving an adequate\ndose  although further investigations would be required\nto confirm this  The disadvantages of using body sur-\nface area  BSA  to dose patients have been discussed at\nlength elsewhere [20–22]  Drug disposition can show\n4–10-fold inter-individual variability  which is inadequately\ncompensated for by using BSA  There is a strong argument\nto include other variables to allow more accurate dose esti-\nmation for each individual \nBergh et al  [23] conducted a randomised trial comparing\n\nhigh-dose chemotherapy versus haematologically-tailored\nadjuvant chemotherapy to assess the effect on RFS and\noverall survival  The haematologically-tailored arm speci-\nfied that participants experienced pre-defined levels of\nhaematological toxicities  This study demonstrated that tai-\nlored chemotherapy rather than high-dose chemotherapy\nshowed improved RFS  One shortcoming of this study was\nthat it used high-dose chemotherapy as the ‘control’ arm \nwhich is not the current standard treatment for early\nbreast cancer  Lindeman et al  [24] conducted a trial\nusing haematological criteria for selecting dosing strat-\negy  Study results  available in abstract form only  did\nnot show a statistically significant improvement in sur-\nvival with tailored-chemotherapy compared with stand-\nard BSA-based chemotherapy  However  both distant\n\nDFS and DFS showed trends towards a better outcome\nfor the tailored chemotherapy arm  Our results show\nthat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is an additional\nprognostic factor for longer-term outcomes  and we sug-\ngest that this could be tested in trials randomising be-\ntween personalising chemotherapy within an adaptive\nprotocol and standard chemotherapy dosing  Interestingly \ntrials in which doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubi-\ncin were increased  NSABP B22 [25]  NSABP B25 [26] \nand CALGB 9344 [27]  did not show benefit in long-term\noutcomes  However  dose-dense trials which increased the\nfrequency of chemotherapy dosing with filgrastim support\n CALGB 9741 [28] and a 10-study meta-analysis [29] \nhave shown improvement in longer-term outcomes  The\nauthors of CALGB 9741 stated that it was their impres-\nsion that the improvements seen in CALGB 9741 were as\na result of the more frequent administration of chemo-\ntherapy  and that use of filgrastim did not by itself add to\nthe efficacy of dose-dense treatment [30] \nThese trials have applied dose intensification with fil-\n\ngrastim support  which has abrogated any ‘signal’ from\nneutropenia  in fact  they have usually shown less febrile\nneutropenia and neutropenic sepsis in the dose-dense\narm  In our study  we have looked at the prognostic effect\nof developing neutropenia in trials which have used stand-\nard chemotherapy dosing without routine filgrastim sup-\nport  Future trials would need to establish whether\nadapting doses to achieve neutropenia would improve\noutcomes  Our hypothesis is that host factors  such as\npharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic factors  influ-\nence the level of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia  and\nonly those patients who do not achieve neutropenia with\nstandard doses may benefit from intensification of chemo-\ntherapy  The evidence would suggest that adapting to a\ndose-dense protocol may be the most effective way to in-\ntensify chemotherapy  The results show that patients\nachieving grade ≥1 have a statistically significant survival\nadvantage  This allows the possibility of using a simple\nstandard haematological measurement to adjust dose \nwhereby dose is adjusted until neutropenia NCI CTCAE\ngrade ≥1 is achieved  after which treatment would be\nmaintained at the same dosing level \nThe potential mechanisms that may explain why\n\nchemotherapy-induced neutropenia is associated with\nimproved survival include neutropenia as a marker of\ncancer stem cell death [22  31]  Other studies have\nproposed that neutrophils may be involved in the control\nof the microenvironment in sites of metastatic spread\n[32–34]  Chia et al  [35] comment that toxicity and clinical\noutcome may be more likely to correlate when the thera-\npeutic agent targets the biological driver of the disease dir-\nectly  for example  sunitinib-associated hypertension [36] \nAlthough the mechanism behind the association between\nchemotherapy-induced neutropenia and clinical outcome\n\nAbraham et al  BMC Medicine   2015  13 306 Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\nis unclear  this study  in conjunction with previously pub-\nlished data [2-4]  provides strong evidence that this associ-\nation is real and clinically relevant \nModerate-severe fatigue  NCI CTCAE ≥2  may be\n\nassociated with a reduced BCSS  This effect was signifi-\ncant in the univariable analysis of fatigue across all treat-\nments  HR = 1 24  95 % CI  1 07–1 43  P = 0 004  but on\nmultivariable analysis BCSS  HR = 1 17  95 % CI  0 99–\n1 37  P = 0 06  became less significant  However  analysis\nof the treatment regimens showed that there was a\nstatistically significant association between moderate-\nsevere fatigue and BCSS in patients treated with ECMF\n Additional file 1  Table S4  The patient characteris-\ntics across all the trials is similar  although 20 % of pa-\ntients in NEAT and BR9601 had fatigue classified as\ngrade ≥2  in comparison to only 10 % in tAnGo and\nNeo-tAnGo  It is notable that 18 % of NEAT and\nBR9601 had a pre-treatment PS ≥1  in comparison to\nonly 8 % and 4 % of tAnGo and Neo-tAnGo patients \nrespectively  Additional file 1  Table S1  Trial eligibility\ncriteria required that patients must have a PS ≤2  It is un-\nclear whether this difference in baseline PS alone accounts\nfor the increased levels of moderate-severe fatigue seen in\nNEAT and BR9601  however  reduced pre-treatment PS\nwould be likely to increase the risk of severe fatigue during\ntreatment [10  11] \n\nConclusions\nThis large and comprehensive study has shown a sta-\ntistically significant association between improved sur-\nvival and neutropenia  using toxicity classification\nNCI CTCAE ≥1 or ≥3  This association is clinically\nrelevant and has the potential to be further tested in\nneutropenia-adapted treatment regimens within clin-\nical trials to assess its potential to improve clinical\noutcome  This study shows that patients with normal\nor reduced BMI experience greater rates of neutro-\npenia in comparison to overweight and obese pa-\ntients  This is particularly relevant in populations\nwhere increasing levels of obesity may mean that a\nsignificant proportion of breast cancer patients are re-\nceiving sub-optimal chemotherapy doses  This study\nalso indicates that chemotherapy-induced fatigue may\nbe an indicator of poor clinical outcome  Patients’\npre-treatment performance status needs to be adequately\nassessed and levels of treatment-induced fatigue need to\nbe carefully monitored and moderated \n\nAvailability of data and materials\nData supporting these findings is held by the Trial\nManagement Group for PGSNPS study  where

breast mass\nVivek Verma1  Sanjay Muttineni2  Rajesh R  Kulkarni1  Edibaldo Silva-Lopez3  William W  West4\n\nand Robert B  Thompson1*\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground  Signs and symptoms of a rapidly enlarging breast mass are not only important for all clinicians to\nrecognize and assess  but also are not uncommon occurrences  We describe a similar but unique case that developed\ninto an enormous  36 cm exophytic mass \n\nCase presentation  A 51-year-old woman with history of psychiatric conditions presented for signs and symptoms\nof sepsis  It was determined that the source was an enormous 36 cm mass originating from the breast/chest wall  After\nstabilizing the patient with antibiotics  she underwent successful resection  Surgical margins were positive  and\nhistopathology demonstrated bland spindle cells with stromal overgrowth  Together with clinical and histopathological\ninformation  the patient was diagnosed with a phyllodes tumor \n\nConclusion  Differential diagnosis of rapidly growing breast masses is discussed  which are not uncommon\noccurrences in clinical medicine  One etiology  phyllodes tumors  can grow into large  exophytic masses as described \nOncologic treatment is discussed  usually consisting of surgery with postoperative radiotherapy for high-risk features \n\nKeywords  Breast tumor  Phyllodes tumor  Radiotherapy\n\nBackground\nThe differential diagnosis of a rapidly growing breast mass\nis very important for not only oncologists  but any health\ncare provider  owing to the relative ubiquity of the symp-\ntoms and need for further workup and treatment  In this\nreport  we describe the exceptional case of a woman who\nnoticed a rapidly growing breast mass that became ex-\ntremely large  We discuss the difficulties of diagnosis as\nwell as differential diagnoses of which clinicians should be\naware \n\nCase presentation\nA 51-year-old woman with history of multiple psychiatric\nconditions including uncontrolled anxiety and depression\npresented to the intensive care unit with tachycardia and\nhypotension  She had initially felt a left breast mass five\nyears ago but not sought medical attention  and the mass\ncontinued growing  Over the past sixteen weeks  the mass\nhad nearly tripled in size and started oozing purulent fluid \nVisual inspection revealed a 36 cm mass composed of\n\nseveral different colored  shaped  and textured tissues  Fluid\ndrainage and necrotic debris was present  Fig  1a  without\naxillary lymphadenopathy or other pertinent physical exam-\nination findings other than appearing ill with mental obtun-\ndation  She received fluid boluses and vasopressors  With\nfurther workup including elevated lactic acid level and\nwhite blood cell count of 31 6 thousand cells per microliter \nbroad-spectrum antibiotics were commenced  Computed\ntomography  CT  revealed a large  36 cm exophytic mass\nin the left chest wall/breast with homogeneous density\n Fig  1b  Systemic staging using CT was negative \nAfter stability in clinical status was achieved  due to great\n\nconcern of ongoing sepsis from the necrotic/infected\ntumor  emergent resection was done  Thus  pre-surgical\nbiopsy could not be performed  although differential diag-\nnoses included abscess/necrosis  sarcoma  phyllodes tumor \nand fibroadenoma  Radical mastectomy was performed\nowing to intraoperative tumor involvement of the pectoralis\nand intercostal muscles  Owing to the emergent circum-\nstances  large tumor size with necrosis  and no prior tissue\ndiagnosis  nodal sampling was performed  lymph nodes\nwere grossly nonenlarged  Owing to no clinical nodal\ndisease as well as clinical suspicion for the aforemen-\ntioned diagnoses  there was no indication for complete\naxillary dissection

mass was difficult  There\n\nwas significant  over 50 %  necrosis with bland spindle\n\ncells being the only detectable cells  Fig  2a  There was\nonly one glandular/epithelial component seen  Fig  2b  with\nsignificant stromal changes and high amounts of mitotic\ncells  45 mitoses per 10 high-powered fields  The deep\nmargin of the tumor was positive as well  Pathological ana-\nlysis demonstrated negative markers for neurofibroma  epi-\nthelial  including breast  carcinomas  melanoma \nrhabdomyosarcoma  fibrosarcoma  or synovial sarcoma \nWhereas the pathological diagnosis was initially an un-\n\nspecified spindle cell neoplasm  adding together the clin-\nical history and presentation  the patient was diagnosed\nwith a phyllodes tumor \n\nConclusions\nPhyllodes tumors most often arise in patients in the 5th dec-\nade of life and vastly more commonly in females [1]  They\nclinically present as a rapidly growing mass based in the\nbreast  which is an important clue for diagnosis even if\npathological diagnosis is inconclusive [2]  Spindle cellularity\nrules out fat necrosis and inflammatory breast carcinoma \nThough only one epithelial  glandular  component was\nseen  the complete absence of such is less common in phyl-\nlodes tumors  likely  mesenchymal components of the\ntumor can overgrow the glanduloepithelial components \nmaking the latter rare to find [1]  Phyllodes tumors are\n\nFig  1 Gross appearance of the mass at presentation  a  left panel \ncomputed tomography image without contrast of patient at\npresentation showing large exophytic mass  b  center panel

2 of 4\n\n\n\noften confused with soft tissue sarcomas as well  including\nfibrosarcoma  which can complicate diagnosis  However \nphyllodes tumors are vastly more common than primary\nbreast sarcomas  occurring around 5–10 times more com-\nmonly  and 20–40 times more than primary breast fibro-\nsarcomas [3]  Much of this involves placement of\nformerly-classified fibroadenomas into other categories \nsuch as synovial sarcomas  Based on the WHO classifica-\ntion [4]  this tumor was a malignant phyllodes tumor\nowing to high hypercellularity/pleomorphism  mitotic rate \ninvasive margins  and stromal overgrowth \nThis patient was treated with postoperative radiother-\n\napy  in part due to positive surgical margins  malignant\nphenotype  and stromal overgrowth  A large retrospect-\nive study of 478 patients with malignant phyllodes\ntumors demonstrated that tumors over 10 cm have\nrecurrence rates of 15 % after mastectomy and worse\nsurvival  which was a primary consideration in proceed-\ning with radiotherapy [5]  Moreover  if a positive surgical\nmargin exists  it is known that stromal overgrowth in\nthe tumor predicts for local recurrence  LR  [6] and dis-\ntant failure  DF  [7]  leading some to theorize that these\npatients may need systemic therapy as well  although\nthis issue remains unresolved \nThese are in contrast to the NCCN guidelines [8] \n\nwhich do not advocate radiotherapy or axillary sta-\nging  but the guidelines assume that a biopsy is per-\nformed to cement the diagnosis and do not account\nfor emergent cases  The guidelines admit that the\nsubtype of phyllodes tumor is less important than\nsurgical margins  which has been corroborated by\nother studies to predict for poorer outcomes [6  7] \nFurthermore  large cohorts analyzed through the\nSEER database [9]  which showed 15-year cancer-\nspecific survivals  CSS  of 89 %  did not demonstrate\nradiotherapy to improve CSS  but due to lack of in-\nformation could not assess radiotherapy’s effects on\nLR  especially with positive margins  On the other\nhand  a study from Europe [10] with 443 women\ndemonstrated 17 % of patients with LR and 3 4 %\nwith DF  most commonly to the lung  On multivariate\nanalysis  factors associated with LR included residual\ndisease/positive margins  borderline/malignant hist-\nology  and lack of radiotherapy  When specifically\nexamining malignant/borderline tumors  radiotherapy\nuse was associated with decreased LR  Factors associ-\nated with improved overall survival were tumors <\n3 cm and absence of necrosis  for malignant tumors \nuse of mastectomy instead of breast-conservation was\nassociated with improved overall survival  The latter\nfinding conflicts with aforementioned data [9]  but\nunderscores the controversy in several aspects of\ntreatment  especially in the rarer cases such as this\npatient \n\nThis patient completed radiotherapy without wound\nhealing complications but owing to psychiatric condi-\ntions and past issues of self-neglect  has failed to follow\nup \n\nConsent\nWritten consent to participate and publish this case was\nobtained from the patient and is

of cancer death among Hispanic women  Certain dietary factors \nhave been associated with the risk of breast cancer recurrence  but data in Hispanic survivors is \nscarce \n\nObjective—to examine dietary patterns and diet quality in two groups of Hispanic breast cancer \nsurvivors \n\nMethods—23 Mexican American  MA  and 22 Puerto Rican  PR  female breast cancer survivors \ncompleted a culturally adapted validated food frequency questionnaire  Intake was standardized \nper 1 000 kcal and compared to US Dietary Guidelines and the DASH-style diet adherence score \nwas calculated \n\nResults—Overweight/obese was 70% in MA and 91% in PR  PR consumed diets rich in fruit/\n100% fruit juices and beans  while MA diets were high in vegetables  beans  and total grains  Both \ngroups consumed high amounts of starchy vegetables  refined grains  animal protein and calories \nfrom solid fats and added sugars but low intakes of whole grains  dairy products and nuts and \nseeds  DASH scores were relatively low \n\nConclusion—MA and PR female breast cancer survivors have different dietary patterns but both \ngroups had relatively low diet quality  These groups could benefit from

Ricans  Mexican Americans\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world  Breast \ncancer survivors comprise the largest group of cancer survivors in the US  with an estimated \n2 8 million survivors  1  Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic \nwomen  the second largest race/ethnic group in the US  2  Even though the breast cancer \nprevalence is lower in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites  Hispanic women are \nmore likely to die from breast cancer than non-Hispanic whites  3  which could be related \nto differences in access to treatment and preventive screening  In Puerto Rico  breast cancer \naccounts for 34% of cancers  4  In the US  breast cancer accounts for 28% of cancers in \nHispanics  5  of which most are Mexican Americans \n\nCertain dietary factors have been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer \nrecurrence  These include diets low in fat but high in fruits  vegetables and soy based foods \n 6  7  On the contrary  diets high in alcohol intake and fat dairy products increases the risk \nof recurrence  8  9  Interventions to encourage a high quality dietary pattern should be \nstudied in breast cancer survivors  However  current eating patterns in Hispanic breast cancer \nsurvivors require investigation in order to appropriately adapt dietary interventions for this \npopulation \n\nWithin the Hispanic ethnicity  there are differences in race  country of origin  levels of \nacculturation  English language proficiency  foods preferences  etc  all of which interact \nwith parameters that affect health behaviors  including dietary patterns  Data from the \nHispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos  a population-based cohort study of \nHispanic/Latino adults of diverse backgrounds showed a large variation in dietary patterns \nbetween the group studied  which included Mexican Americans  Puerto Ricans  Dominicans  \nCubans  Central Americans and South Americans  10  For example  this study found the \nlowest fruit intake among Puerto Ricans and the highest among Dominicans and the lowest \nvegetable intake among Dominicans and the highest intake among Mexicans Americans \n\nThus  it is important to study how dietary patterns differ between and within specific ethnic \npopulations so that culturally relevant behavioral interventions to improve dietary patterns \ncan be developed  However  little is known about dietary patterns among the different \nHispanic groups of breast cancer survivors  Therefore  the aims of this study were to \nexamine the dietary patterns  fruits  vegetables  meats  water  sugary beverages  fats  refined \nand whole grains  dairy products  seeds and nuts  alcohol and diet quality  in two groups of \nHispanic breast cancer survivors  Mexicans-Americans and Puerto Ricans  Results from this \nstudy could increase our understanding of the dietary patterns in this group of at-risk \nwomen

pilot test the effectiveness and feasibility of a 16-week culturally \ntailored exercise intervention for sedentary Mexican American and Puerto Rican breast \ncancer survivors  The study was conducted in two sites  The University of Texas MD \nAnderson Cancer Center in Houston  Texas and The University of Puerto Rico Cancer \nCenter in San Juan  Puerto Rico  Participants were randomized to a 16-week culturally-\nadapted exercise program  a non-culturally adapted standard exercise intervention or a wait-\nlist control group  At the end of the trial  participants completed a culturally adapted and \nvalidated food frequency questionnaire  FFQ \n\nThe study was reviewed and approved by an institutional review board at both sites and all \nparticipants provided consent to participate \n\nParticipants\nEligibility criteria of the main study were  21 years of age or older  self-reported Mexican \nAmerican or Puerto-Rican  at least 3 months post-treatment of breast cancer  not meeting the \nAmerican College of Sports Medicine guidelines for physical activity  11  not taking cancer \ntreatment medications  except hormonal therapy  and having completed the FFQ \n\nStudy procedures and measures\nDemographics and health—A short demographic survey was administered to \nparticipants at baseline only  Information on age  race and ethnicity  educational level  \nhousehold income  medical history and current medications were collected  Physical activity \nand sedentary time in the past seven days was assessed using the short version of the \nInternational Physical Activity Questionnaire at 16 weeks \n\nBody composition—Height  m  and weight  kg  were measured following standard \nprocedures  12  Participants were classified as healthy weight if BMI was  0 05  More Puerto Rican women were overweight/obese \n\nPalacios et al  Page 5\n\nJ Immigr Minor Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 April 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

Adherence to the \nDASH-style diet  which emphasizes the intake of plant proteins  fruits and vegetables  \nmoderate amounts of low-fat dairy products  and low amounts of sweets and sodium  was \nsomewhat low and not related to weight status \n\nThese dietary patterns are consistent with those found in other studies in Puerto Rican and \nMexican American individuals  Data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of \nLatinos also reported different dietary patterns among these groups  10  Puerto Ricans had \nthe lowest intake of fruits  1 4 servings/d  vegetables  2 5 servings/d  and fish  0 5 \nservings/d  and highest intake of sugar-sweetened beverages  1 8 servings/d  compared to \nthe other groups  In addition  intake of whole grains was rather low  0 8 servings/d  \ncompared to refined grains  5 6 servings/d  as well as dairy intake  1 6 servings/d  In \nMexican Americans  intake of fruits  1 9 servings/d  vegetables  3 4 servings/d  and whole \ngrains  2 8 servings/d  were higher  intake of dairy products  1 7 servings/d  was similar and \nintake of sweetened beverages  1 5 servings/day  was lower compared to Puerto Ricans  \nThese results are consistent with what we found in the present study  In addition  baseline \ndata from 3 088 breast cancer survivors in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living study  \nwhich included a mix of Hispanics from Mexico  the Caribbean  Central and South America  \nfound similar intakes of fruits  2 7 servings/d  and vegetables  2 7 servings/d   23  compared \nto the Mexican Americans in the present study \n\nThe findings of the present study have important implications for developing interventions \nfor Puerto Rican and Mexican American breast cancer survivors  Based on our results  diet \nquality in general needs improvement  specifically targeting strategies to increase intake of \nvegetables and whole grains  particularly in Puerto Ricans  increase intake of low-fat dairy \nproducts and reduce intake of red meat  added sugars and added fats  such as sugar \nsweetened beverages and fat used for cooking  particularly those high in saturated fat  This \ncould potentially reduce breast cancer recurrence in these populations as evidenced by the \nfew studies examining the relation between foods and dietary patterns and breast cancer \nrecurrence  24-26  In 2522 postmenopausal breast cancer

Outcome Expectations among Breast \nCancer Survivors\n\nRachel Hirschey  PhDc  RN  Sharron L  Docherty  PhD  PNP-BC  FAAN  Wei Pan  PhD  and \nIsaac Lipkus  PhD\nDuke University School of Nursing  Durham  North Carolina\n\nAbstract\nBackground—Exercise is associated with decreased recurrence risk  improved survival and \nquality of life for breast cancer survivors  However only an estimated 17% - 37% of survivors \nadhere to the American Cancer Society exercise guidelines  A critical first step to increase exercise \namong survivors is to understand how they believe exercise will effect them \n\nObjective—To explore common exercise outcome expectations among 20 female survivors of \nstage IA – IIB breast cancer who completed adjuvant treatment and an exercise intervention \nInterventions/Methods—A mixed-method descriptive study consisting of semi-structured \ntelephone interviews assessed exercise outcome expectations and how the experience of cancer \nand its treatment influenced expected outcomes of exercise  The qualitative data were analyzed \nusing a summative content analysis procedure  means were calculated for each item of the exercise \noutcome questionnaire  The qualitative and quantitative data were compared and contrasted \n\nResults—The sample was 70% Caucasian and 30% African American with a mean age was 62 \nyears  ± 8 5  and average time since treatment completion of 4 2 years  ± 1 3  Three themes \nemerged from the interviews  1  prevalence of common expectations  2  pervasive impact of \nfatigue  and 3  a brighter future  Overall  findings revealed that breast cancer survivors have low \nlevels of agreement that exercise may mitigate late and long-term cancer and treatment effects \n\nConclusions—In general  breast cancer survivors  even those who are motivated to exercise  do \nnot hold strong beliefs that exercise will decrease late and long-term treatment effects \n\nImplications for Practice—Clinicians can educate survivors about exercise benefits \n\nThe American Cancer Society  ACS  recommends that breast cancer survivors engage in at \nleast 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes/week of strenuous intensity \naerobic exercise and strength training exercises twice weekly 1 However  only 17% – \n37% 2 3 of breast cancer survivors in the United States  US  comply with these activity \nrecommendations  Among those who exercised pre-diagnosis  levels decrease during \nadjuvant therapy and fail to return to pre-diagnosis levels after completion of treatment 4 5 \nThis is remarkable in light of empirical work supporting breast cancer survivors as generally \n\nCorresponding Author  Rachel Hirschey  PhDc  RN  Duke Univerity School of Nursing  307 Trent Dr  Room 3080  Durham  NC

recommended levels may be to explore their \nbeliefs about the results of exercise  In this paper we report on breast cancer survivors' \nknowledge and beliefs about benefits of exercise \n\nFor survivors  remission does not always equate to a return to pre-diagnosis health  \nfunctioning  and quality of life  Advancements in cancer treatments have substantially \ndecreased mortality rates and brought about a surge in the number of long-term survivors  \nwith approximately 2 8 million breast cancer survivors alive in the US today  These \nsurvivors may endure many physical  psychological  emotional  social  and spiritual \nchallenges for up to 10 or more years after finishing treatment 7 8 Long-term effects  such as \nfatigue  are those that begin during and persist beyond the conclusion of primary treatment 9 \n\nLate effects  such as secondary cancers  are those that do not manifest until primary \ntreatment is complete 9\n\nExercise has been shown to decrease many negative long-term and late effects caused by \nchemotherapy  radiation  surgery  and hormone therapy 10 Thus it may become even more \nbeneficial to survivors to exercise after treatment than it was pre-diagnosis  For example  \ncardio-pulmonary gains from exercise are especially significant for survivors who have \nundergone chemotherapy and may be at risk for cardio-pulmonary toxicities and aerobic \ncapacity decline 9 11 Similarly  women who undergo radiation are at risk for bone loss and \nmuscular atrophy 12 both of which are improved by regular exercise 13 14 Further  exercise \nimproves quality of life for breast cancer survivors through decreasing treatment effects \nincluding fatigue 14 15 pain 16 17 decreased self-esteem 18 trouble concentrating 19 weight \ngain 20 21 depression 22 and disrupted sleep 23 Finally  due to the association of exercise and \nrecurrence risk reduction  exercise may improve QOL by providing a sense of control to the \nestimated 34% of breast cancer survivors who fear recurrence to the degree that it effects \nquality of life 24 Because exercise lessens long-term effects and is associated with a 20-50% \nlower risk of recurrence 25-29 it is especially advantageous for survivors  Yet the extent to \nwhich survivors are aware of these benefits and recognize their increased need for exercise is \nnot well known \n\nA critical step in increasing exercise among survivors is understanding what outcomes they \nexpect from exercise  that is outcome expectations  OEs  OEs refer to what people expect to \nobtain or avoid by engaging in a behavior  Simply stated  people exercise because they \nbelieve it will produce desired and avoid undesired outcomes 30 Understanding survivors' \nOEs is key to understanding their exercise behavior  OEs are highly influential in predicting \nhealth behaviors and are thus central to key theoretical frameworks of health behavior \nchange such as social cognitive theory 30 theory of planned behavior 31 and transtheoretical \nmodel 32 Among non-cancer populations  individuals who expect more positive and less \nnegative outcomes are more likely to exercise 33 34 Understanding survivors' exercise OEs \nmay provide insights to clinicians and researchers about how to promote exercise among \nsurvivors  Identification of more and less recognized OEs will illuminate which OEs to \nreinforce and which to introduce \n\nHirschey et al  Page 2\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

only one study that identified OEs among survivors who have \ncompleted adjuvant treatment 35 Findings indicated that among 8 survivors  common \nexercise OEs include enjoyment  increased energy  feeling good mentally  and maintaining a \nhealthy weight 35 Exercise effects on late and long-term treatment effects  such as recurrence \nrisk were not identified by survivors in this study  Thus the purpose of this study was to \nexplore common exercise OEs among breast cancer survivors and develop a deeper \nunderstanding of their beliefs about exercise \n\nMethod\nDesign\n\nA mixed-method descriptive design was used to explore exercise-related outcome \nexpectations in women post breast cancer treatment \n\nRecruitment\nA convenience sample of twenty female survivors of stage IA – IIB breast cancer were \nrecruited  The sample was post adjuvant treatment and had completed an exercise \nintervention study 36 at an academic tertiary care center in the southeastern US within the \nlast year  The parent study was a three-arm randomized controlled trial that included a 16–\nweek lab based aerobic exercise intervention  Participants were randomized to either \nmoderate-intensity exercise  strenuous-intensity exercise  or an attention control stretching \ngroup  It is not our intention to examine effect of group assignment on OEs as all groups \nengaged in some intensity of exercise  Because this sample had exercised  it was identified \nas an ideal group of women to provide preliminary insights into the exercise outcomes that \nmay be most motivating and thus important to target in future exercise interventions for \nbreast cancer survivors  The study prescribed to state and national ethical standards  and was \napproved by the medical center Institutional Review Board \n\nProcedures\nA semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct telephone interviews to assess \nexercise outcome expectations and if and how the experience of cancer and its treatment/s \ninfluenced expected exercise outcomes  At the beginning of the interview “regular exercise” \nwas defined by the interviewer as 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical \nactivity and examples of fast walking  baseball  tennis  and easy bicycling were provided  \nThe interview questions  see Table 1 for interview guide  were selected based on a literature \nreview of OEs and consultations with experts in exercise oncology as well as experts in OEs  \nThe telephone interviews began with open-ended questions about participants' exercise OEs  \nmoving them first through their expectations about exercise in general  and then specific \nOEs related to cancer and treatment effects  such as recurrence risk  After the open ended \nquestions were asked  participants' answers to the exercise specific questions were elicited \nby using the Outcome Expectations for Exercise  OEE  Questionnaire 37 which was \nadministered by the investigator during the interview  The

ask about exercise outcomes specific to breast \ncancer and its treatment  we modified the OEE questionnaire by adding 15 items to assess \nlevel of agreement about exercise specific to breast cancer survivors  These breast cancer \nspecific items were identified through a review of empirical studies  Items with both \ncausative and correlational support were included  Face validity of the additional 15 items \nwas agreed on by the first author  last author and an exercise physiologist who has expertise \nin oncology  See Table 2 for items from the Modified Outcome Expectations for Exercise \nQuestionnaire including those from the OEE and the breast cancer specific items that were \nadded  All interviews were conducted by the first author and digitally recorded  On average  \nthe interviews lasted 18 minutes  Notes were taken during the interviews and all recordings \nwere reviewed twice  by the first author  to confirm accuracy of written notes \n\nData analysis\nThe qualitative data were analyzed using a summative content analysis procedure  First  the \ncontent of the interviews related to exercise OEs was identified and quantified  Next  latent \nanalysis was conducted to make meaning of the exercise OEs 39 Alternative terms for \ncommon keywords and content were identified and their contexts were examined  The \ntrustworthiness of the qualitative analysis and findings were strengthened by the following \nprocedures  An audit trail was created to document data collection  coding and analysis \ndecisions  Reflexive memos where made by the first author  immediately following the \ninterviews and these notes were reviewed in conjunction with the audio recordings to \nidentify linkages  gaps and questions  Peer debriefing was completed between the first and \nlast author to discuss emerging findings  throughout data analysis  Specifically  throughout \ndata collection and analysis  the two researchers met on a weekly basis to review interview \ncontent and discuss analysis and findings  The first author also consulted with a qualitative \ndata analysis expert on three occasions to discuss emergent findings \n\nThe quantitative data were analyzed by calculating means and standard deviations for each \nitem on the modified OEE questionnaire  Results from the quantitative and qualitative \nanalyses were linked to ascertain whether they confirm  refute  or otherwise extend or \nmodify each other  and the interview findings offered potential explanations for the \nquantitative findings \n\nParticipant demographics and characteristics of the parent study were collected to assure \nscientists and clinicians working to increase exercise among breast cancer survivors will be \nable to evaluate usefulness of study findings for the patients with whom they interact \n\nResults\nDemographic and medical-related characteristics\n\nThe sample  n=20  was 70% Caucasian and 30% African American  The mean age was 62 \nyears  ± 8 5

Data\nParticipants were asked  using both broad open-ended and specific questions  to talk about \ntheir exercise-related outcome expectations  Overall  responses were consistently non-\nspecific and provided minimal details  For example  many participants said they expect to \nfeel better from exercise  but despite probing for greater detail  were unable to discuss in \nwhat way or how  Participants predominately discussed mental or psychological benefits of \nexercise with greater detail provided for psychological than physical benefits  Even when \nasked to focus specifically on physical outcomes  most defaulted to discussing mental health \nbenefits or concluded with final thoughts about the importance of exercise to psychological \nhealth  Importantly  participants did not discuss exercise outcomes related to treatment \neffects such as decreased recurrence risk or improved cardiac health  Overall they seemed \nunaware of the potential benefits that exercise has to ameliorate negative health effects of \ncancer and its treatments  Three general themes emerged from analysis of the interviews  1  \nprevalence of common expectations  2  pervasive impact of fatigue  and 3  a brighter future \n\nPrevalence of common expectations—Participants identified and focused \npredominately on the benefits that exercise has for the general  non-cancer population  The \nsix most commonly reported expected outcomes or OEs included increased energy  feeling \ngood overall  cardiac health  general health  feeling good mentally and achieving healthy \nweight  When prompted to talk about exercise outcomes in relation to how it may influence \neffects associated with their cancer treatments  they had difficulty identifying specific \nbenefits  This sample of women was not able to identify the added benefit that exercise has \nfor those who had survived cancer and its treatment  For example  none spontaneously \ndiscussed decreased recurrence risk as an exercise OE  When probed to talk about how their \nexperience with cancer and treatments has changed what they expected to experience from \nexercise  30% said they thought exercise might decrease their recurrence risk  One woman \nexplained that she did not learn this from her health care providers and stressed that nurses \nshould educate patients about the association of exercise with recurrence risk  She said \n\n“Breast cancer is less likely to occur in the first place and less likely to recur if you \nexercise - I never knew this  I only learned this through the study [referring to the \nparent RCT]  My doctor actually told me to stop walking the dog during treatment - \nI didn't listen to her  I decided that was the worst advice I ever got  I would have \nlost out if I had listened  I walked through my whole treatment  In fact  nurses are \nimportant in relaying the message about exercise and cancer  I didn't get any of this \ninformation through treatment ”\n\nTalk about the heightened benefits of exercise for cancer survivors was limited to two \nparticipants  10%  who provided examples of an increased need for exercise due to \ntreatment effects  One participant discussed her expectation that exercise would mitigate \nproblems she has with her heart that resulted from cancer treatment  Another woman said  \n“Even now five years later I still have some side effects - major joint and bone pain  Exercise \nworks best to help with this ”\n\nHirschey et al  Page 5\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

to exercise  Increased energy was the most common theme participants \nsaid they enjoyed or would enjoy most from exercise  However  others  40%  expressed \nextreme fatigue  most often a result of hormone therapy  as a barrier to exercise  One \nparticipant stated she has “scaled back what I expect  I have problems with my energy  \ntamoxifen almost killed me  and my body is still trying to recover from the treatments ” \nSimilarly  another participant expressed that she needs to exercise more but she is too tired  \nshe said “cancer  radiation  then that medication I took for a year zapped my energy ” \nSeveral participants explained that they are simply too fatigued to exercise and saved their \nenergy for other higher priority life activities \n\nA brighter future—Many participants  35%  focused and elaborated on the psychological \nbenefits they have or expect to experience from exercise  When the women talked about \nphysical benefits  they tended to just list them  however  those who experienced mental \nbenefits discussed them in more detail  While participants valued both physical and \npsychological outcomes of exercise  the psychological outcomes were described as the most \npowerful in affecting their lives  One woman explained  “you really need to focus on mental \nbenefits of exercise for breast cancer and control is a big issue too  you are dealing with not \nbeing in control  exercise is something you can do ” Another participant explained that \nexercise really helped her to survive cancer  she said “to go through diagnosis and treatment \nand the aftermath is a lot to go through  Personally I think exercise makes it brighter at the \nend  That you want to stay healthier  you want to eat healthier  you look at life differently \nbecause of the diagnosis  A lot of people say cancer  oh god  you hear a lot of women die \nand you hear the good stories and I say I'm a survivor ” Participants did not discuss the \npersonal importance of physical outcomes \n\nQuantitative data\nOur intent in using the OEE measure was to quantitatively explore potential exercise \noutcomes participants thought exercise was most and least likely to produce  Cronbach's \nalpha of the modified measure for this sample is 0 94  demonstrating excellent reliability  \nThe mean agreement scores and standard deviations from the modified OEE measure are \npresented in Table 3  Mean level of agreement scores for each item were calculated and \nranged from 2 8  outcome participants least agreed would result from exercise  to 1 1 \n outcomes participants most agreed would result from exercise  The average level of \nagreement score was 1 9 for psychological outcomes  1 7 for physical outcomes and 1 7 \noverall  We used the mean level of agreement score of 1 7 to divide the outcomes into those \nparticipants most agreed would result from exercise  score <1 7  and those participants who \nleast agreed with what would result from exercise  score ≥ 1 7  Notable items with a mean \nagreement score ≥ 1 7 include  reducing long-term effects of treatment  feeling less tired  \nsleeping better  increasing length of life  reducing recurrence risk  increasing mental \nalertness and decreasing risk of osteoporotic bone fractures  These items are noteworthy as  \ndespite empirical support of their benefit  they were those least endorsed by this sample of \nsurvivors \n\nHirschey et al  Page 6\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

whether they confirmed or \nrefuted each other  The qualitative data was used to make meaning of the quantitative data  \nWe first explored how often items with less agreement on the OEE measure  i e  scores \nabove 1 7  were mentioned during the interview  Again  the quantitative results indicated \nthat participants reported lower levels of agreement in relation to exercise resulting in  \nimproved sexual desire  improved sexual satisfaction  decreased neuropathy  decreased \nlymphedema  reduction in long term side effects of breast cancer treatment  feeling less \ntired  sleeping better  being an enjoyable activity  increasing length of life  recurrence risk \nreduction  improved arm range of motion  increased mental alertness and decreased risk for \nosteoporotic bone fracture  With the exception of feeling less tired  items with low \nagreement scores were not prominent in the qualitative data \n\nSurvivors have been known to be motivated to exercise to reduce their fear of recurrence 41  \nHowever  recurrence risk reduction did not spontaneously come up in the qualitative \ninterviews  When asked more specifically about potential exercise outcomes in relations to \nhaving cancer and treatments  30% mentioned recurrence risk reduction  Finally when asked \nas part of the OEE measure  risk reduction was rated with a lower level of agreement  m = \n1 7  and several participants paused and made comments such as “huh  I have no idea”  “I \nreally don't know”  “I really hope so  so I'm going to have to say one ”\n\nIn summary both the qualitative and quantitative data supported that among a sample of \nwomen who are motivated to complete an exercise study  there are low levels of agreement \nthat exercise may mitigate several significant late and long-term cancer and treatment \neffects \n\nDiscussion\nOverall  findings from this study highlight that despite extensive evidence that exercise \neffectively treats many long-term and late treatment effects  survivors who are motivated to \nexercise may still be unaware or question these potential benefits  While this sample \ngenerally has positive expectations of exercise  they still hold some doubt about the efficacy \nof exercise as a treatment for long term cancer effects  Given these findings among a sample \nof survivors who have exercised  knowledge related to exercise benefits among those who \nare not motivated to exercise is highly questionable  Breast cancer survivors' OEs may be \nsimilar to those of non-cancer survivors  The qualitative data revealed that the most common \nOEs of breast cancer survivors are increased energy  feeling good overall  cardiac health  \ngeneral health  feeling good mentally  and achieving healthy weight  These findings are \nsimilar to those of Short and Colleagues  2013  who report that breast cancer survivors \nanticipate enjoyment  increased energy  feeling good mentally and maintaining a healthy \nweight as effects of physical activity  Thus there is an opportunity to increase awareness \nabout the exercise benefits that extend beyond those for the general population to those that \ndecrease late and long term cancer and treatment effects \n\nMean scores from the quantitative data indicate that outcomes breast cancer survivors least \nagree exercise will produce are  decreasing long-term effects of breast cancer treatment  \n\nHirschey et al  Page 7\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

osteoporotic bone fractures  These \nqualitative and quantitative data are congruent  Specifically  none of the items with a low  ≥ \n1 7  quantitative agreement score  i e  outcomes survivors are least likely exercise will \nproduce  were discussed by participants in the qualitative interviews  The absence of low \nagreement outcomes in the qualitative data confirm the finding that survivors do not agree  \nare unaware  or rarely think about exercise resulting in such outcomes  Especially notable is \nthe low scores for recurrence risk and lack of recurrence risk in the qualitative data  These \nfindings support each other in that overall  survivors are unsure of the efficacy of exercise to \ndecrease recurrence risk  Both survivors who do and do not exercise  should be made aware \nof the association between exercise and risk recurrence \n\nIncreased awareness of the numerous diverse positive outcomes of exercise may motivate \nbreast cancer survivors to exercise more  The greatest concerns among breast cancer \nsurvivors include fear of recurrence  fatigue  sleep disturbance  neuropathy  concerns about \nlong-term effects of treatment  weight changes  and sexual issues 7 all of which exercise can \npositively impact  Generally  cancer survivors are motivated to engage in behaviors they \nbelieve will improve their health including exercise 41 Thus  it is possible that increased \nawareness of the efficacy of exercise to improve long term and late effects may motivate \nsedentary survivors to exercise and help maintain or increase activity among active \nsurvivors \n\nIn addition to increasing knowledge about exercise benefits  highlighting psychological \noutcomes may be especially effective to increase exercise among breast cancer survivors  \nThis sample  of survivors who have exercised  discussed psychological OEs in greater detail \nthan physical outcomes  Participants explained that they enjoy the psychological outcomes \nof exercise and that these benefits are especially important given the emotional challenges of \ngoing through cancer and treatment  These findings indicate that psychological outcomes are \ncrucial to focus on in exercise interventions among this population \n\nFatigue plays a significant role in breast cancer survivors' decisions to exercise  Cancer-\nrelated fatigue is defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network as “a distressing \npersistent subjective sense of physical  emotional  and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion \nrelated to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and that \ninterferes with usual functioning ” 42 Cancer-related fatigue persists up to ten years into \nsurvivorship 43 44 Increased energy was one of the most common OEs in the qualitative data  \nyet the quantitative data indicates low levels of agreement that exercise will help survivors \nfeel less tired and sleep better  This contradiction confirms the pervasive nature of fatigue \nrelated to exercise  as survivors identify fatigue as both a great benefit of and barrier to \nexercise  Indeed  survivors who exercise consistently report having more energy 45 Further \nresearch is needed to identify how to break down fatigue as an exercise barrier so that \nsurvivors may exercise to enjoy higher levels of energy and an improved quality of life  \nSimilarly  efforts are needed to increase levels of exercise to decrease fatigue experienced by \nsurvivors \n\nHirschey et al  Page 8\n\nCancer Nurs  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March

motivated survivors actively \nengaged in an exercise intervention  limiting generalizability of findings to all breast cancer \nsurvivors  Yet  this sample provided great initial insights into what may motivate exercise \namong survivors  However  because all participants completed a 16-week lab based exercise \noncology intervention at a large research hospital  it is reasonable to consider that these \nparticipants are more aware of exercise outcomes  compared to other breast cancer survivors  \nThis indicates that among the larger breast cancer population  there is likely an even greater \nneed to shine light on the benefits of exercise related to cancer and treatment effects  \nAnother study weakness is the accuracy with which the quantitative measure assessed OEs  \nItems on the measure were asked after participants had thought about and discussed \noutcomes of exercise  Thus  these conversations may have primed participants and impacted \ntheir rating \n\nImplications of these findings\nClinicians working with breast cancer survivors have an opportunity to educate survivors \nabout the role exercise plays in managing late and long-term side effects  Connections \nbetween the heightened need for exercise due to treatment effects should be outlined for \npatients  Particular attention should be given to the association between exercise and \nrecurrence risk reduction  Overall  research is needed to identify the most effective strategies \nto increase breast cancer survivors' exercise OEs  as a means to increase exercise  OEs have \nseveral dimensions including 1  importance – value placed on the outcome s 46 47 2  \ncertainty - perceived probability outcome s  will occur 46 48 and 3  accessibility – the \nfrequency with which outcome s  are considered 46 49 50 Interventions that simultaneously \nenhance all these dimensions may be most effective to increase exercise  In summary  it may \nbe necessary to both increase survivors' awareness of diverse exercise outcomes as well as \nenhance the importance and certainty of these outcomes \n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Dr  Lee Jones  the principle investigator of the randomized

\n\nMethods—Breast cancer survivors  n=200  were recruited at their first post-surgical surveillance \nmammogram  6-15 months post-surgery  Women without a breast cancer history  n=150  were \nrecruited at the time of a routine screening mammogram  All women completed measures of \nbreast pain  pain interference with daily activities and intimacy  worry about breast pain  anxiety \nsymptoms  and depression symptoms  Demographic and medical information were also collected \n\nResults—Persistent breast pain  duration ≥ 6 months  was reported by 46 5% of breast cancer \nsurvivors and 12 7% of women without a breast cancer history  p<0 05  Breast cancer survivors \nalso had significantly higher rates of clinically significant persistent breast pain  pain intensity \nscore ≥3/10  as well as higher average breast pain intensity and unpleasantness scores  Breast \ncancer survivors with persistent breast pain had significantly higher levels of depressive \nsymptoms  as well as pain worry and interference  compared to survivors without persistent breast \npain or women without a breast cancer history  Anxiety symptoms were significantly higher in \nbreast cancer survivors

with a \nhistory of breast conserving cancer surgery compared to women without that history  Strategies to \nameliorate persistent breast pain and to improve adjustment among women with persistent breast \npain should be explored for incorporation into standard care for breast cancer survivors \n\nKeywords\npersistent breast pain  breast cancer  breast surgery  surgical pain\n\nWith approximately 230 000 women diagnosed each year  breast cancer affects more women \nin the United States than any other cancer [1]  For most women with breast cancer  curative \ntreatment includes breast surgery  with either a full or partial mastectomy accompanied by \nsentinel or comprehensive axillary lymph node resection [2  3]  Accumulating evidence \nsuggests that a substantial proportion of women experience persistent breast pain after breast \nsurgery [4-6]  The prevalence of persistent pain in breast cancer survivors following surgery \nhas been reported to range from 25-60% across studies [4-11]  with little indication of \ndiminution over the months and years following surgery [5  8  10] \n\nThe majority of studies examining persistent pain following breast surgery have focused on \ncomparing breast cancer survivors with and without persistent post-surgical pain  The \nprevalence of persistent breast pain in breast cancer survivors has rarely been compared to \nwomen without a breast cancer history  Yet  considerable evidence from survey studies \nsuggests that chronic  noncyclical  mastalgia is common among healthy women [12]  To our \nknowledge  only one published study of persistent pain following breast cancer surgery has \nincluded a comparison group of women with no history of breast cancer [4]  That study  \nusing mailed questionnaires  found that 24% of women had persistent breast pain following \nbreast cancer surgery  while 10% of women without a history of breast cancer reported \nsimilar symptoms [4] \n\nIn the present study  we examined persistent breast pain in breast cancer survivors and a \ncomparison group of women with no history of breast cancer or breast surgery  All women \nwere recruited and assessed in person in a breast imaging clinic prior to a routine \nsurveillance mammogram  Breast cancer survivors in this study had all been treated with \nbreast conserving surgery  e g  lumpectomy  quadrantectomy  partial or segmental \nmastectomy  and were undergoing their first post-treatment surveillance mammogram  six \nto fifteen months post-surgery  Prevalence of persistent breast pain and clinically significant \npersistent breast pain were compared across breast cancer survivors and women with no \nbreast cancer history  To explore the impact of persistent breast pain  levels of anxiety \nsymptoms  depression symptoms  worry  and pain interference with activities of daily life \nwere also examined \n\nMethod\nParticipants\n\nWomen were recruited from two academic medical centers located in the northeastern \nUnited States and southeastern United States between June 2009 and October 2011  Two \n\nEdmond et al  Page 2\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 January 01

history of breast cancer \nand women without a breast cancer history  Women with breast cancer were eligible if they \nwere at least 21 years old  were diagnosed with Stage I-IIIA breast cancer  were treated with \nbreast conserving surgery  e g  lumpectomy  quadrantectomy  partial or segmental \nmastectomy  and were within 6 to 15 months post breast cancer surgery \n\nWomen without a history of breast cancer were eligible if they were age 40 or older  \nundergoing a routine screening mammogram and had never undergone breast surgery  Breast \ncancer survivors were recruited at the time of their first post-treatment mammogram  women \nwithout a cancer history were approached in the same week as a breast cancer survivor \n\nProcedures\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both sites  Eligibility was \nassessed via medical record review  under a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct  HIPAA  waiver obtained for this purpose  Prospective participants were contacted by a \nletter from the breast imaging clinic at least two weeks prior to the date of their scheduled \nmammogram  On the date of their scheduled mammogram  prospective participants were \napproached in the breast imaging clinic by research staff and informed consent procedures \nwere conducted in a private area of the clinic  Women then completed questionnaires \ndescribed below  as part of a larger longitudinal study examining predictors of \nmammography adherence  Keefe  R01-CA-131148-05 \n\nMeasures\n\nSocio-demographic and medical characteristics—Information on age  education  \nrace  marital status  employment status  and comorbid illnesses were collected from each \nparticipant  Information about medical background was also collected  including \nmenopausal status  For breast cancer survivors  information specific to breast cancer  \nincluding stage at diagnosis  type of surgical treatment  receipt of adjuvant therapy  and \ndates of cancer treatments were also collected from the medical record \n\nBreast pain—Breast pain intensity  unpleasantness  duration  frequency  and location were \nassessed  Breast pain-related interference  worry  and medication use were also measured  \nPain intensity  We used three items from the Brief Pain Inventory  BPI [13] modified to \nassess breast pain  Women were asked to rate  1  the worst breast pain intensity during the \npast month  2  the average breast pain during the past month  and 3  current breast pain  on a \n0  no pain  to 10  worst pain imaginable  scale  These three items were averaged to create a \ntotal score  Consistent with prior studies [4  9]  clinically significant breast pain was defined \nas having a pain intensity score of ≥3 out of 10  Although some studies use a more stringent \npain intensity cutoff of ≥4  we chose ≥3 out of 10 because we anticipated relatively low \nlevels of breast pain in women without a history of breast cancer or breast surgery  The BPI \nhas demonstrated adequate reliability and sensitivity in prior studies[7  14]  Cronbach's \nalpha in this sample was 0 89  Pain unpleasantness  Women rated the average unpleasantness \nof breast pain in the past month using a 0-100 visual analog scale  VAS  with 0 indicating \nnot bad at all and 100 indicating the most intense unpleasantness imaginable[15  16]  Pain \nDuration  Women were asked how long they had experienced breast pain  i e  less than six \n\nEdmond et al  Page 3\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 January 01

life  Having persistent \nbreast pain was defined as having breast pain for ≥6 months  Clinically significant persistent \nbreast pain was defined as having a pain intensity score of ≥3 out of 10 and breast pain \nduration of ≥6 months  Pain frequency  Women were asked to indicate how often they \nexperienced breast pain  i e  never  less than monthly  monthly  weekly  daily  or hourly  \nLocation of pain  Women completed full body maps to indicate areas where they \nexperienced pain  Additionally  they completed a more detailed body map  showing the \nchest  shoulders  and upper arms  to indicate locations of breast pain[17]  Pain Interference  \nWomen were asked to rate the degree to which breast pain interfered with daily activities \nand sexual activities/intimacy in the past month using 0  none  to 10  extreme  scales  \nadapted from the Brief Pain Inventory[13]  Items were averaged to create an interference \nscore  Worry  Women indicated the degree to which they worry that breast pain may be a \nsign of breast cancer on a 0 to 10 scale  0=no worry  10=extreme worry  Medication use  \nWomen were asked how often they took pain medication for breast pain  i e  never  \nsometimes/not every month  monthly  or daily \n\nDepression and anxiety—The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  HADS [18] is \nwidely used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in primary care patients  cancer \npatients  and the general population  The HADS is a 14-item measure with two subscales  \nAnxiety  HADS-A  7 items  and Depression  HADS-D  7 items  Women rate each item \nover the past week on a 4-point scale that ranges from 0 to 3  For each subscale  items are \ntotaled to yield a score that ranges from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating greater \nsymptoms[19]  The HADSA and HADS-D demonstrated good internal consistency in this \nsample  alpha= 87 and  81  respectively \n\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were computed  Bivariate analyses  e g  chi square and t tests as \nappropriate  were conducted to determine if breast cancer survivors and women without a \nbreast cancer history differed  p<0 05  on demographic or medical variables  Subsequent \nanalyses comparing these study groups controlled for race  as race differed by group  \nLogistic regression and analysis of covariance  ANCOVA  were conducted to examine \ndifferences in pain-related variables for breast cancer survivors and women with no breast \ncancer history  Finally  differences in symptoms of anxiety  depression  pain interference  \nand worry about breast pain were examined among three groups  breast cancer survivors \nwith persistent breast pain  breast cancer survivors without persistent breast pain  and \nwomen without a breast cancer history  using logistic regression and ANCOVA models  All \nmodels included demographic variables that were associated  p<0 05  with persistent breast \npain or the dependent variables in bivariate analyses  Demographic variables included in \nmodels were age  race  0=non-white  1=white  and marital status  0=not partnered  \n1=partnered  Group comparisons were examined using a pairwise family error correction \n overall p<0 05 for each dependent variable \n\nEdmond et al  Page 4\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 January 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

variables with a few exceptions  time since \nsurgery was positively correlated with anxiety  r = 0 15  p=0 04  and depression  r=0 20  \np=0 01  such that longer time since surgery was associated with greater symptoms of \nanxiety and depression \n\nDiscussion\nPersistent breast pain was reported by almost half  46 5%  of the breast cancer survivors in \nthis study compared to only 12 7% of women without a breast cancer history  The study \nfurther revealed that breast cancer survivors with persistent breast pain had higher levels of \ndepression symptoms  worry about pain  and pain interference than breast cancer survivors \nwithout persistent breast pain  or women without a breast cancer history  Together these \nfindings suggest a substantial impact of persistent breast pain in the lives of breast cancer \nsurvivors \n\nSeveral prior studies have found symptoms of depression to be associated with persistent \nbreast pain in breast cancer survivors [20  21]  but this relationship has been inconsistent \nacross studies [9  22]  Pre-operative depression has been identified as a potential risk factor \nfor the development of persistent post-surgical pain in longitudinal studies of patients \nundergoing orthopedic surgery[23]  cardiac surgery[24]  lumbar discectomy[25]  and in \nwomen after breast cancer surgery[26-28]  However  other studies have not found a \nsignificant association between pre-operative depression and persistent post-surgical \npain[29  30]  Thus  the relationship between depressive symptoms and persistent post-\nsurgical pain continues to be difficult to clarify from a causal perspective  We also found that \nanxiety symptoms were higher among women with a history of breast cancer and persistent \nbreast pain as compared to women without a history of breast cancer or breast surgery  \nconsistent with other studies that reported an association between pain and anxiety [9  20  \n21  27  30  31]  however  in this cross-sectional study it is not possible to say if anxiety was \npresent prior to the development of persistent breast pain  More research is needed to \nimprove understanding of the development of persistent breast pain over time and how it \nrelates to psychosocial distress  e g  longitudinal studies to examine the relationships among \npre- and post-surgical depression  anxiety  and pain \n\nAmong breast cancer survivors with persistent breast pain  61 3% reported clinically \nsignificant persistent breast pain  i e  a pain intensity score of 3 or greater  which is similar \nto results from prior studies[9  20  27]  At the same time  only 19 3% of breast cancer \nsurvivors with persistent breast pain reported ever taking pain medication for their breast \npain  Prior research has suggested that cancer patients are often hesitant to take pain \nmedication [32]  and interventions aimed at reducing barriers to taking pain medication may \n\nEdmond et al  Page

helping \nwomen better manage their pain and improve quality of life \n\nThis study has several strengths  To our knowledge  it is the second study to compare \nwomen with a history of breast cancer to a group of women without a breast cancer history \non measures of persistent breast pain  and the first to do so in the United States  It is also the \nfirst study of persistent breast pain to concurrently examine psychological distress among \nbreast cancer survivors and women without a breast cancer history  Additionally  this study \nexamines women who are 6 to 15 months post-surgery  while most literature in this area has \nstudied women five or more years post-surgery  Examining correlates of persistent breast \npain in the years immediately following surgery is important  because it provides the \nopportunity to identify modifiable factors that may emerge soon after treatment  Additional \nresearch that contributes to a better understanding of modifiable factors contributing to \npersistent breast pain and its impact among women undergoing breast-conserving surgery is \nneeded \n\nThis study also has several limitations  The observational  cross-sectional  study design \nlimits our ability to draw causal conclusions  Future research should follow women \nprospectively to better understand factors contributing to the development of persistent \nbreast pain and how the report of persistent breast pain changes over time both prior to and \nfollowing surgery  We used a relatively liberal pain intensity cutoff of ≥3 out of 10 for 6 \nmonths or longer to define persistent breast pain in our sample  while other studies have \nused ≥4 out of 10  Given that over 50% of our sample reported no pain  we may be capturing \nthe experience of relatively mild pain as compared to other studies of women of moderate to \nsevere breast pain  Our sample was largely white and primarily well-educated  and lacked \nrepresentation from a number of ethnicities and races  which limits our ability to generalize \nour results to other groups of women  Further  we recruited women from two academic \nmedical centers presenting for scheduled mammograms  and patients who come to these \nfacilities may differ from women in the community who seek treatment elsewhere or women \nwho do not schedule mammograms  Future research should broaden recruitment strategies \nto determine if the prevalence and correlates of persistent breast pain are similar in other  \nmore diverse populations  Finally  this study is unable to examine the impact of cancer as \ncompared to surgery as it influences persistent breast pain  nor does it explicitly examine \nhow surgical variables or cancer-related variables  e g  stage  time since surgery  influence \npersistent breast pain  Future studies may want to use other control groups  such as women \nundergoing breast surgery who do not have cancer  to further examine these relationships \n\nIn this study  we sought to examine differences in persistent breast pain among breast cancer \nsurvivors who were treated with breast conserving surgery and women without a history of \nbreast cancer  and found that breast cancer survivors reported significantly higher rates of \npersistent breast pain  We also examined rates of depression symptoms  anxiety symptoms  \nworry  and pain interference in this sample  and found that breast cancer survivors with \npersistent breast pain experience greater depression symptoms  worry about breast pain  and \npain interference than those without persistent breast pain  These findings highlight the \nimportance of further research to better understand factors involved in persistent breast pain \n\nEdmond et al  Page 8\n\nClin J Pain  Author manuscript

clinical research  They are expected to assist prognosis assessment and therapeutic decision\nmaking  Notwithstanding  an evidence-based approach is needed to bring gene signatures from the laboratory to clinical\npractice  In early breast cancer  multiple prognostic gene signatures are commercially available without having formally\nreached the highest levels of evidence-based criteria  We discuss specific concepts for developing and validating a\nprognostic signature and illustrate them with contemporary examples in breast cancer  When a prognostic signature has\nnot been developed for predicting the magnitude of relative treatment benefit through an interaction effect  it may be\nwishful thinking to test its predictive value  We propose that new gene signatures be built

‘treatment-effect modifiers’  A voluminous lit-\nerature of >150 000 papers documenting thousands of claimed\nbiomarkers has been produced in medicine of which fewer than\n100 have been validated for

for node-negative  N0  ER-positive  ERþ  HER2-\nnegative  HER–  breast cancer [8]  This divergence may result\nfrom the degree of subjectivity in evidence evaluation or from a\ndifferent vision of what type of evidence is needed for a gene signa-\nture to be clinically useful  In this commentary  we focus on prog-\nnostic and predictive gene expression signatures in breast cancer\nto highlight the difficult path from the laboratory to the clinic  but\nthe concepts are applicable to other omics data \n\nprognostic versus predictive signature \nwhat’s in a name \nGene signatures can assist clinicians in prognosis assessment\nand therapeutic decision making  A signature is prognostic if it\ndiscriminates well between patients with a good or bad progno-\nsis in the absence of treatment or in the context of a standard\ntherapy  In the top left panel of Figure 1  we show an example of\n\nprognostic signature  for untreated patients  dashed lines  the\nsurvival profile is very different according to the signature cate-\ngories  i e  the likely natural course of the disease can be fore-\ncasted thanks to the signature values [9]  On the other hand \nwhatever the risk group  the relative effect of treatment  solid\nversus dashed lines  is similar  A signature is called predictive\n of the treatment effect  if the relative treatment benefit varies\naccording to signature values  In the bottom panels of Figure 1 \none can see that the treatment is beneficial only for low-score\npatients  while for high score ones it is either less beneficial\n left  quantitative interaction  or harmful  right  qualitative\ninteraction  In the case of a quantitative interaction  the mag-\nnitude of the relative treatment effect is different  but the effect\nis in the same direction  In this case  it is not clear that treat-\nment could be withheld in any of the subgroups  In the case of a\nqualitative interaction  the direction of the treatment effect is\ndifferent according to signature values  The most appropriate\nway to identify a predictive gene signature is through an inter-\naction test between the signature and the treatment using data\nfrom a trial [10]

estimated\nabsolute risk reductions from large randomized trials do still\nprovide the best guidance [10]  Even when there is not a single\npredictive signature or biomarker for a particular treatment \nprognostic signatures or biomarkers can be useful for prognosis\nand treatment counseling [11]  In early breast cancer  for\ninstance  the proportional risk reduction obtained by chemo-\ntherapy does not significantly vary according to CP factors  even\nin large well-powered meta-analyses [12  13]  If we assume a 33%\nrelative risk reduction using chemotherapy regimen in an ERþ\n\nearly breast cancer population [12]  we can estimate absolute\nincreases in 10-year predicted survival when adding chemother-\napy to endocrine therapy [14]  For example  for an N0 ERþ\n\npatient with a 10-year breast cancer-specific survival predictions\nof 95% with endocrine therapy  the absolute benefit when adding\nchemotherapy is estimated by 2% which needs to be outweighed\nagainst potential side effects of the treatment \n\nprognostic gene signatures  the\nevidence-based path from proof of\nconcept to clinical utility\n\ndevelopment and validation of a signature\nOne of the very first steps in the development of a gene signature\nis finding out how to compute a score based on the biomarkers\nmeasured  while the number of biomarkers keeps on increasing\nwith technology advances  Identifying a meaningful prognostic\nmodel through high-dimensional regression raises particular\nchallenges from a statistical point of view  including nonidentifi-\nability of the models  instability of selected biomarkers [15] \nsparse model selection and multiple testing  Several penalized\nmethods exist to perform variable selection in this high-dimen-\nsional space [16]  while controlling the risk of false positives [17] \nTable 1 shows different criteria to evaluate when developing a\n\nsignature from bench to bedside  The EGAPP initiative has pro-\nposed general definitions of analytical and clinical validity  and\nof clinical utility [18]  which are transposed here to the gene sig-\nnature context  Issues related to the assessment of their analytical\nvalidity are beyond the scope of this review  The assessment of\nthe generalizability of a gene signature needs independent valida-\ntion of its prognostic value in multiple series  this is now well\nestablished [19–21] and will not be detailed here \n\ncompare the signature with established\nclinico-pathological factors\nA key issue in assessing the added value of a prognostic signature\nis to study whether it adds independent prognostic information\nto the risk determined by a CP model  incremental value  A\ngene signature could also be of interest if it provides a more\nreproducible  cheaper or more accurate measurement of an\nalready existing biomarker that has proven clinical utility so that\nthe CP rule could be updated [20]  The Oncotype Dx assay is\nvery successful in the USA with an estimated target market pene-\ntration of 50% [22]  One could hypothesize that one of the main\nreasons for its success is that a proliferation-based signature\nmeasured by a single reference laboratory took the place of the\nhistological tumor grading  which has been plagued by a per-\nceived suboptimal between-laboratory reproducibility [23] \nTo illustrate how to evaluate incremental prognostic value \n\nwe used publicly available microarray data of 845 patients  189\npathological complete responses or pCRs  from eight clinical\nstudies that included patients treated by anthracycline-based\nchemotherapy [24]  We computed two gene signatures  an\napproximate version of the MammaPrint signature that we\ndenote as proliferation signature and an immune-based gene\nsignature [24]  Because the gene signatures are often derived on\ndifferent microarray platforms from different laboratories and\nheterogeneous retrospective patient cohorts  we computed the\nscores as a weighted average of the genes and scaled each signa-\nture within study so that the 2 5% and 97 5% quantiles equaled\n 1 and þ1  respectively [24  25]  The added value of the two\ngene signatures was evaluated in logistic regression models\nafter adjustment for CP factors as detailed in Table 2  When\nusing the likelihood ratio test relative to the model with estab-\nlished prognostic factors only [26  27]  both signatures do add\nsignificant prognostic information to the CP model and they\nboth add information to each other  We also evaluated the dis-\ncrimination  i e  the ability to distinguish patients who had a\npCR from those who did not  through the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve  AUC  for the CP\nmodel with and without the gene signatures  The AUC of the\nCP model was already high  0 78  95% CI 0 75–0 82  Figure 2\nand Table 2  illustrating the strong discrimination of the CP\nfactors  Adding both the signatures provided only a slight\nincrease  0 80  95% CI 0 77–0 83  Therefore  the added dis-\ncrimination of the gene signatures for pCR is moderate in this\nneoadjuvant example in breast cancer  This is often the case in\n\nTable 1  Evidence-based criteria for a prognostic gene signature in the path from the laboratory to clinical practice\n\nNo  Concept Elaboration\n\n1 Proof of concept Do

Oncology\n\n2162 | Michiels et al  Volume 27 | No  12 | December 2016\n\n\n\napplications in medicine as only very strong independent prog-\nnostic factors can lead to large increases in predictive accuracy \nFor survival outcomes  there exist different generalization of\nthe AUC [28  29] and an alternative measure is an R2-type sta-\ntistic to compare the extra variation in clinical outcome\nexplained by the gene signature [30]  Of note  also the batch\nand laboratory effects typically observed play a role in the lack\nof applicability of many gene signatures in the clinic  for which\na fully specified algorithm is needed for a single patient from a\nrandom batch or laboratory \nIn another example of 883 women treated with either tamoxi-\n\nfen or letrozole monotherapy in the Breast International Group\n\n1–98 trial  one of the cited proliferation signatures in breast can-\ncer  the Genomic Grade Index  was prognostic of the distant\nrecurrence-free interval  in addition to the CP model as meas-\nured by the likelihood ratio test [31]  Nevertheless  similar results\nwere obtained with centrally reviewed continuous Ki67 by an\nexpert pathologist  which highlights the importance of including\nall known prognostic factors in the CPmodel \nIn addition to the discrimination  it is also of importance to\n\nevaluate the calibration of prediction models that include gene\nsignatures  i e  the agreement between predicted risk and clinical\noutcome frequencies [32]  In our opinion  very little is known\nabout the calibration of the commercially available gene signa-\ntures in early breast cancer  e g  for patients with a predicted 10-\nyear risk of distant metastasis below 5% with the CP model and\nwith the CP model plus the signature  what is the observed fre-\nquency of distant events at 10-years  Adding the gene signature\nto an established model will also be only of interest if the pre-\ndicted risk of such patients changes sufficiently compared with\nthe standard CP model to have consequences in terms of treat-\nments  Useful summary measures and graphical displays to eval-\nuate the subtle changes in prediction scores of patients can be\nfound elsewhere [32–34] \n\nclinical trial designs for prognostic signatures\nTo assess the readiness of omics-based tests for guiding patient\ncare in clinical trials  a useful tool is the checklist developed by\nthe USA National Cancer Institute [35]  covering issues related\nto specimens  assays  mathematical modeling  clinical trial\ndesign  and ethical  legal and regulatory aspects  Trial designs\nevaluating the clinical impact of patients being offered a prog-\nnostic gene signature are rather similar to available trial designs\nfor diagnostic tests [36–39]  The operating characteristics of\nsome of the trial designs integrating gene signatures in breast\ncancer have been discussed previously [40]  In the MINDACT\nstudy [41]  a randomized trial was setup in the discordant risk\npopulation—based on a CP model and the gene signature—to\nevaluate the capacity of the MammaPrint signature to identify\npatients in whom chemotherapy can be avoided when the

sufficient to answer this objective  If the two predic-\ntion models  CP model and gene signature  disagree in 32% of\nthe patients  and if the treatment reduces 10-year mortality in\nthe overall population from 24% to 20%  then the absolute differ-\nence in mortality between the two strategies is only 0 5%  and it\nhas been calculated that 50 000 patients would be necessary to\nidentify this mortality difference in a statistically satisfactory\nmanner [42] \nIn the TAILORx trial [43]  women with intermediate\n\nOncotype DX signature risk score were randomized between\nadjuvant chemotherapy and not  and the primary objective is to\nevaluate the noninferiority of the control arm compared with the\nchemotherapy arm  It may seem peculiar to set up a noninferior-\nity trial of standard chemotherapy of which the relative efficacy\nis already well known  Recently  the data and safety monitoring\ncommittee of the TAILORx trial recommended that the results\nof the unrandomized low-risk group defined by Oncotype Dx be\nreleased [44]  After a median follow-up of 6 7 years  the esti-\nmated 5-year invasive disease-free survival was 93 8%  95% CI\n92 4%–94 9%  in this low-risk group  The question remains\nwhether such a subgroup of patients could not have been identi-\nfied with a solid CPmodel \nThe big hope behind these trials is that secondary analyses\n\nwould reveal variation in relative efficacy according to fine-tuned\nmodeling of CP factors and the gene signatures that were missed\nin prior analyses of historical trials by categorized CP risk\ngroups  On the other hand  one could argue that  if the biological\nsignal was really strong  even a less reliable measurement method\n e g  of ER and Ki67  with a different categorization would\nalready have shown some variation  This may be matter of sub-\njective debate  In both these trials  since the annual rate of distant\nrelapse or deaths is quite low in early breast cancers  a very long\nfollow-up is required to answer the clinical questions [40]  These\nexamples illustrate that  in the context of a relatively good prog-\nnosis population and a small absolute treatment benefit  of che-\nmotherapy  developing a randomized controlled trial to\ndemonstrate the clinical utility of a prognostic gene signature is\nquite challenging and that a cohort study may in several occa-\nsions be a more appropriate tool to develop and validate a fine-\ntuned CP plus gene signature model \n\ncost-effectiveness\nThe very last aspect in studying a gene signature is its cost-effec-\ntiveness  despite beingmore prognostic than the CPmodel alone \na signature could be of limited usefulness if its cost is too high \nFor illustration  in the population of N0 breast cancer patients \ntheMammaPrint signature was deemed unlikely to be cost-effec-\ntive from the French National Insurance perspective [45] \nFor EGAPP  the cost-effectiveness evaluation is only seen as a\n\ncontextual factor [18]  while for the National Institute for Health\nand Care Excellence in the UK  the value of diagnostic technolo-\ngies is based on three main criteria  test accuracy  clinical effec-\ntiveness and cost-effectiveness  Specific evidence requirements\nneed to be defined for policymakers and reimbursement agencies\nto introduce gene signatures or molecular tests into clinical prac-\ntice from a health economical perspective [2] \n\n‘predictive’ gene signatures as\ntreatment-effect modifiers\nThe approach of treating broad populations of patients and\nhaving large inclusion criteria in clinical trials is based on the\nassumption that treatment-by-subset interactions are unlikely\nto occur on mortality end points [46]  On the other hand \nincreasing knowledge of biology suggests that such interactions\nare actually more likely to occur than previously thought [47] \nwith ER  HER2  KRAS and EGFR mutations as famous exam-\nples  Furthermore  ignoring strong treatment-by-biomarker\ninteractions in a patient population can substantially reduce\nthe statistical power of trials aimed at showing the overall bene-\nfit of new treatments [48]  Recently  there have been some\nattempts to identify gene signatures that are associated with\nhigher benefit of treatments  such as an 8-gene and a 14-gene\nsignature for the degree of trastuzumab benefit in early breast\ncancer [49  50]  There is some risk of overoptimism in these\ntwo examples since the former was flawed by a well-known\nerror in cross-validation that consists of not retesting all the\ngenes in each of the folds of the cross-validation [51] and the\nlatter used data from another expression platform on a subset\nof the patient series to perform a first gene selection  Before\noutlying the approach to develop gene signatures that interact\nwith relative treatment benefit  we have a look again at the\nprognostic signatures in early breast cancer \n\nare some of well-known prognostic signatures in\nearly breast cancer also predictive  wishful\nthinking \nNone of the published gene signatures in early breast cancer we\nstudied so far was developed for predicting the relative magni-\ntude of a treatment effect  i e  they were fitted in the develop-\nment series using only main effects for prognosis  Nevertheless \na study has claimed that the Oncotype DX signature predicts\nthe magnitude of chemotherapy benefit [52]  when including\nin a subtle manner the patients from the development series\n[19]  The only truly independent evaluation of Oncotype DX\nwas performed in a subset of 367 patients included in the S8814\ntrial for node-positive  ERþ postmenopausal breast cancer\nwomen  in which the gene signature was tested for interaction\nwith additional chemotherapy prior to tamoxifen [53]  This\nstudy showed a significant treatment-by-signature interaction\nin the first 5 years after inclusion in a Cox regression model\n interaction P ¼ 0 03  Nevertheless  once this model also\nincluded ER expression  the interaction was no longer statisti-\ncally significant  P ¼ 0 15  which suggests that there may be\nsome confounding between the gene signature and ER expres-\nsion  furthermore  the subdivision of the time scale in two peri-\nods  before and after 5 years  may or may not have been\npreplanned  The small number of events in the different sub-\ngroups defined by the signature makes it hard to obtain reliable\ntreatment effect estimates  A prospective randomized con-\ntrolled trial  RxPonder  has been started to replicate this che-\nmotherapy by signature interaction by making the bold\nassumption that there would exist a qualitative interaction\nbetween the chemotherapy and the gene signature on invasive\ndisease-free survival [54] \n\nspecial articles Annals of Oncology\n\n2164 | Michiels et al  Volume 27 | No  12 | December 2016\n\n\n\ndevelopment of predictive gene signatures in\nrandomized controlled trials\nIn randomized controlled phase III trials of an experimental\ntreatment versus standard treatment or placebo  it has become\ncommon to test multiple candidate predictive biomarkers on\nbaseline tumor or plasma samples for a possible interaction with\ntreatment effect  If the predictive signature is known beforehand \nalternative procedures exist to test the effect of the treatment\nboth in the overall trial population as well as in the signature-\npositive  or -negative  subgroup of patients [40  55] \nPreviously  we proposed a global interaction approach for\n\ncontrolling the family-wise type I error of a predictive signature\n\nin a randomized controlled trial [25  56]  The interaction statistic\nmeasures the degree of differential treatment effect according to\ngene signature values  To evaluate the global interaction signal  a\npermutation procedure was proposed  Figure 3  The underlying\nidea is that if the biomarkers are not predictive  they are\nexchangeable between patients in same arm  thus  by repeatedly\nrearranging the biomarkers of the patients and by computing the\ninteraction statistic for each permutation  the distribution of the\nglobal test statistic under the null hypothesis is obtained and can\nbe used to compute the P-value of the statistic observed in the\noriginal data  In case of a significant interaction signal  the mag-\nnitude of treatment effects within subgroups defined by the sig-\nnature values will determine whether it has some clinical\nimportance for which a large number of events is needed \nSeveral strategies have been proposed to identify and validate\n\na signature in a randomized trial using cross-validation techni-\nques to overcome a potential overfitting issue [40  57–59]  Figure\n4 shows the general scheme of cross-validation in this context \nThe data at hand are divided into K groups  often 10  For each\ngroup  the data from the remaining K   1 groups are used to\nselect themost predictive biomarkers which will make up the sig-\nnature and coefficients are estimated  Then  the data in the\nexcluded group are used to calculate the signature for left-out\npatients  The entire model building procedure is iterated over the\nK folds to obtain a gene signature score for each patient and to\nevaluate the capacity of the signature to predict the magnitude of\ntreatment effect  The application of the entire gene signature\nbuilding process to the full randomized controlled trial data leads\nto an ‘indication’ classifier to use for future patients [60]  An\napplication of this analysis strategy on trials of adjuvant anthra-\ncycline-based chemotherapy can be found in [25]  Developing a\ngene signature requires selecting the biomarkers which are the\nmost predictive and combining them efficiently in the regression\n\nInteraction strength\n\nGlobal interaction value\nof the test statistic\n\n= the proportion of K permutations\nin which the test statistic sj\n\nexceeds s for the

as the number of\nbiomarkers at hand increases  New statistical developments in\nthis active field of research aim to extend existing selectionmeth-\nods to higher dimensional setting [61]  One of the major matters\nin this context is achieving the right balance between type I error\nand power  Once a predictive signature has been successfully\nidentified in a phase III trial  its performances will need to be\nevaluated in a truly independent trial \n\nconclusions\nIn this commentary  we have illustrated the challenges in taking\na gene signature from bench to bedside for which more clear evi-\ndence-based requirements are needed [2] \nClinical trial designs originally proposed for diagnostic tests\n\ncan be adopted for trials with prognostic gene signatures  We\npropose to shift from prognostic gene signatures to gene signa-\ntures specifically developed on randomized controlled trial data\nas treatment-effect modifiers  Our approach consists of applying\nfirst a global permutation test  If the global test gives a green light \na treatment-modifying gene signature can be developed on the\ntrial data using a particular variable selection method and a\ncross-validation scheme to estimate treatment effects within\ngene signature defined subgroups  More research is ongoing on\napproaches to develop and validate gene signatures in random-\nized controlled trials  In the era of data sharing of clinical trials  a\nlarger role for meta-analyses of individual patient data can be\nexpected in this context  Last but not least  in clinical trials of\ngene signatures some of the strongest logistical challenges are to\ncontrol confounding that can arise through the handling of the\nspecimens  batch effects within and between laboratories  meas-\nurement error and tumor heterogeneity \n\nacknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the associate editor and the reviewers for\ntheir fruitful comments \n\nfunding\nNT received a PhD grant from the Foundation

body measurements is complex and most studies fail to account for this complexity  We\nidentified key aspects of body size which jointly  over the life-course  since adolescence  are associated with\nestrogen-receptor-positive  ER+  breast cancer risk \n\nMethods  Among 109 862 women participating in the California Teachers Study cohort  3844 were diagnosed with\ninvasive ER+ breast cancer between 1997–1998 and December 2011  Based on validated self-reported height and\nweight at age 18  baseline  and 10-year follow up and waist circumference at 2-year and 10-year follow up  we\nidentified 16 a priori body-size phenotypes  Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models provided estimates of\nhazard rate ratios  HR  and 95% confidence intervals  CI \n\nResults  Premenopausal breast cancer was influenced by adolescent  but not adult  body size  HR = 0 51  95% CI 0 \n31–0 86 for body mass index  BMI  kg/m2  ≥25 vs <20 at age 18  Among postmenopausal women currently using\nhormone therapy  only those with the greatest body size had increased breast cancer risk  HR = 1 36  95% CI 1 13–1 \n64 for height ≥67 inches and adult BMI ≥25 vs height <67  Among postmenopausal women not currently using\nhormone therapy  the relationship between body size and risk was complex  with the largest effects of adiposity\namong short women  Among short women  those with gluteal adiposity  HR = 2 70  95% CI 1 77–4 10  and those\nwho continued to gain weight throughout adulthood  HR = 2 57  95% CI 1 60–4 12  were at greatest risk  whereas\nthose who had been overweight/obese since adolescence were not at increased risk  HR = 1 33  95% CI 0 84–2 10 \nHeight was associated with a small increased risk  with borderline statistical significance \n\nConclusions  Considering absolute body mass in adolescence and at two points in adulthood  dynamic changes in\nadiposity over time  and body fat distribution  we identified obesity phenotypes associated with ER+ breast cancer\nrisk  Our approach more clearly identifies specific risk groups than do analyses that evaluate similar measures\nseparately  These findings may aid in improving risk prediction models and developing targeted interventions  and\nmay clarify inconsistent findings across studies \n\nKeywords  Breast cancer  Body size  Obesity  Adiposity  Body fat distribution  Height  Life course\n\n*

last\n30 years worldwide has been the rapidly increasing\nprevalence of overweight and obese individuals and the\nimpact of this epidemic on the risk of many cancers and\nother chronic diseases  It is well-established that body\nsize impacts breast cancer risk and that these associa-\ntions vary by menopausal status and the use of hormone\ntherapy  HT  [1–3]  The risk of premenopausal breast\ncancer is elevated among tall women and reduced\namong obese women [1  2]  Overall  postmenopausal\nwomen are at greater risk of breast cancer if they are tall\nor obese or have substantial adult weight gain or abdom-\ninal adiposity [1  2]  However  these effects are limited to\nwomen who have not used HT [1  2  4–7]  Thus  with\nthe substantial reduction in HT use since the early\n2000s  body size may have a greater impact on postmen-\nopausal breast cancer risk than in past decades  Both\nrisk and the mechanisms involved also vary by the hor-\nmone receptor status of the tumor  particularly whether\nit is estrogen-responsive [3  8] \nMost epidemiologic studies have examined body size\n\nmeasures as single independent variables or as the joint\neffects of two variables  However  the interrelationships\nbetween various body measurements are complex - indi-\nvidual measures are often correlated with each other\n e g  weight and waist circumference  and over time\nwithin an individual  In addition  the associations be-\ntween body size and disease risk reflect confounding and\ninteractions and can vary over the life-course  For ex-\nample  obesity early in life may not only reduce the risk\nof premenopausal breast cancer  but continued obesity\nthroughout life may delay or ameliorate the risk of post-\nmenopausal breast cancer normally associated with\nobesity in later life [4  9  10]  Thus  our objective was to\nidentify key aspects of body size over the life-course\n since adolescence  that are associated with risk of the\nmost commonly diagnosed breast cancers  i e  those that\nare estrogen-receptor-positive  ER+  jointly considering\naspects of absolute obesity and stature  changes in adi-\nposity over time  and body fat distributions using data\nfrom our large  diverse cohort of women prospectively\nfollowed for more than 10 years \n\nMethods\nThe California Teachers Study  CTS  recruited 133 479\nactive and retired female public school teachers  admin-\nistrators  and other professionals in 1995–1996 [11]  At\nthe time participants joined the cohort  baseline  they\ncompleted a self-administered questionnaire addressing\nhealth and medical history  including menopausal status \nHT use  and body size  lifestyle  and other exposures\nand behaviors  The second follow-up questionnaire \ncompleted in 1997–1998  included self-measured waist\n\nand hip circumferences  The third  2000–2001  updated\nmenopausal status and HT use and the fourth  2005–\n2006  updated menopausal status  HT use  and body size\nmeasures  Response rates to the follow-up question-\nnaires were 75%  74%  and 67%  respectively  with 88% of\nthe active cohort completing one or more follow-up\nquestionnaires  The CTS was approved by the Institu-\ntional Review Boards at the Cancer Prevention Institute\nof California  City of Hope National Medical Center  the\nUniversity of Southern California  the University of\nCalifornia at Irvine  and the California Health and Human\nServices Agency \n\nAssessment of body size\nBody size measures included in the present analysis were\nheight  body mass index  BMI  kg/m2  weight change \nand waist-to-height ratio  WHtR  Self-reported height\n in inches  at baseline and at age 18 years were highly\ncorrelated  r = 0 97  Thus  adult height was defined as\nheight at baseline and if missing  as height at age 18 \nBMI was calculated based on self-reported weight\n reported in pounds and converted to kilograms  at age\n18 and baseline and adult height as described above\n converted to meters  At the 2-year follow up  women\nwere provided a standard heavy-weight flexible paper\ntape measure  calibrated in inches on both sides with\neach side a different color to prevent errors in measure-\nment  and asked participants to measure their waist and\nhip circumferences following written  illustrated instruc-\ntions  We chose to use WHtR  instead of waist-to-hip ra-\ntio  as a measure of abdominal adiposity as the former\nhas been found to be a better predictor of visceral fat \nwhile the latter is more strongly correlated with subcuta-\nneous fat [12  13]  Details on the measurement and val-\nidation of body measurements have been published\nelsewhere [4]  The 10-year follow-up questionnaire in-\ncluded questions to update information on weight and\nwaist circumference  Weight change between age 18 and\nbaseline and baseline and the 10-year follow-up were\ncalculated \nWe used the following measures to identify lifetime\n\nbody size phenotypes  adult height  adolescent BMI  at\nage 18 years  BMI at baseline  weight change from age\n18 to baseline among women of normal weight  i e \nBMI <25  at baseline  and WHtR among women who\nwere overweight  i e  BMI 25 0–29 9  or obese  BMI\n≥30  at baseline  Based on a priori decisions  we evalu-\nated weight change only among women of normal\nweight  BMI <25  under the assumption that among\noverweight/obese women the BMI attained was more\nimportant than the amount of weight gain  Similarly \nbody fat distribution  WHtR  was evaluated only among\noverweight/obese women under the assumption that in\nthe absence of significant adipose tissue among women\n\nHorn-Ross et al  Breast Cancer Research   2016  18 132 Page 2 of 13\n\n\n\nof normal weight  the site of that tissue had minimal ef-\nfect  These assumptions also kept the total number of\nphenotypes evaluated at a reasonable number and were\nfurther justified by the very small number of women in\nmost of the subgroups when additional stratification as\ndescribed was examined post hoc  In a second set of\nanalyses we also incorporated BMI at the 10-year follow\nup and weight change from baseline to the 10-year fol-\nlow up  the latter among women of normal weight at the\n10-year follow up \n\nFollow up for outcomes\nThe CTS cohort is followed annually for cancer diagno-\nses  changes of address  and deaths  Cancer diagnoses\nare determined by linkage with the California Cancer\nRegistry  CCR  a population-based cancer registry \nwhich contributes data to the National Cancer Institute\nSurveillance  Epidemiology  and End Results program \nand covers the entire state of California  As more than\n99% of all cancer diagnoses among California residents\nare reported to the CCR [14]  cohort members who con-\ntinue to reside in California are effectively in active fol-\nlow up of cancer outcomes  Changes of address are\nobtained by annual mailings  notifications from partici-\npants  and record linkages with multiple sources includ-\ning the US Postal Service National Change of Address\ndatabase  California and national mortality files are used\nto ascertain date of death \n\nStudy population\nFor the present analysis  we sequentially excluded\nwomen  who at baseline were judged to have invalid data\noverall  n = 2  did not live in California  n = 8867  had a\nprior history of breast cancer  identified by self-report or\nby linkage with the CCR  n = 6212  or whose prior his-\ntory of cancer was unknown  n = 139  had a bilateral\nmastectomy prior to joining the cohort  n = 11  or were\naged 85 years or older  n = 1980  We began follow up\nfor the present analysis at the time that the 2-year\nfollow-up questionnaire was completed  because this\nwas when abdominal adiposity was assessed  Thus  we\nalso excluded women who had moved out of California\n n = 1711  died  n = 674  or had been diagnosed with\nan invasive or in-situ breast cancer during that time\nperiod  n = 754 and 151  respectively  Also excluded\nwere 530 women with breast cancer whose ER status\nwas unknown and 2586 women with unknown meno-\npausal status or HT data at all three assessments  i e \nbaseline  5-year  and 10-year follow-up  Thus  the ana-\nlysis cohort included 109 862 women among whom\n3844 were diagnosed with incident invasive ER+ breast\ncancer between completing the 2-year follow up in\n1997–1998 and 31 December 2011 \n\nStatistical analysis\nMultivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was\nused to estimate hazard rate

HT use were collected at base-\n\nline and updated based on data collected at the 5-year\nand 10-year follow up  For each woman  these character-\nistics were modeled as time-varying covariates with four\nlevels  premenopausal  postmenopausal  currently using\nHT  postmenopausal  not using HT  and unknown \nPerimenopausal women  those with a last menses within\nthe past six months  were included with the postmeno-\npausal groups based on HT use  The data were repre-\nsented as a counting process  with transitions at the\ndates of the two follow-up questionnaires  or the median\ncompletion date for non-responders  for each subject\nwhose status changed  Three subsets of the resulting\ncounting process data were created for subsequent ana-\nlyses  premenopausal  postmenopausal  currently using\nHT  and postmenopausal  not using HT  and separate\nregression analyses were performed on each subset \nThere were 46 847 women who contributed time to the\npremenopausal subset  49 581 to the postmenopausal/\ncurrent HT use subset  and 60 278 women to the post-\nmenopausal/no HT subset \nAge  in days  was used as the time metric in all regres-\n\nsion models  with stratification by age  in years  at base-\nline to adjust for calendar effects  Potential confounders\nwere identified based on prior knowledge and their inde-\npendent associations with breast cancer risk within each\nmenopausal/HT subset in our cohort  All potential con-\nfounders were evaluated in each subset separately  For\npremenopausal breast cancer  covariates included in the\nfinal analyses were a history of benign breast disease\n yes  no  and family history of breast cancer in a first-\ndegree relative  yes  no  For postmenopausal breast can-\ncer among women currently using HT  the covariates\nwere nulliparity and among parous women  age at first\nfull-term pregnancy  in years  history of benign breast\ndisease  family history of breast cancer in a first-degree\nrelative

physical\nactivity nor four other dietary patterns [15] were associated\nwith risk in any of the menopausal/HT-use groups and\nonly 5% of the women were smokers at baseline [11]  thus \nthese factors were not included as potential confounders \n\nModel selection\nFor each menopausal/HT subset  our approach for iden-\ntifying the lifetime body size phenotypes of importance\nproceeded in three steps  First  we examined the effects\nof each body size variable separately across a range of\nlevels  collapsing each variable  when possible  into two\nor three categories based on the observed HRs and CIs \nwith the goal of maintaining prediction while achieving\nthe most parsimonious model  Second  we used the cat-\negories identified from step one to create and evaluate a\nfull model obtained by partitioning the dataset into a set\nof disjoint phenotype categories based on the joint con-\nsideration of height  adolescent BMI  BMI at baseline \nweight change among those with normal BMI at base-\nline  and type of adiposity  abdominal vs gluteal  among\nthose who were overweight or obese  as described above \nFinally  we repeatedly collapsed categories created in\nstep two to achieve a final parsimonious model that\nmaximized prediction  Collapsing of categories was\nbased on sample size  precision  within each phenotype\nand comparisons of between-phenotype differences\nusing the Wald test \nWomen with missing data on the covariates included\n\nin a given subset were omitted from the analyses re-\nported in Tables 3 and 4  Women with missing data on\nany of the body size measures needed to define a specific\nphenotypic category in a given model were included in a\nsingle “missing” category for that model  As categories\nwere collapsed  women could reenter the analyses  hence\nthe number of cases reported in the two tables may not\nexactly sum over the collapsed categories  Once we ob-\ntained the best fitting model for each menopausal/HT\nsubset  we further evaluated the effects of later adult\nbody size using the same procedures and BMI and\nweight change data from the 10-year follow up \n\nResults\nAt the start of follow up  46 822 women were premeno-\npausal  36 977 were postmenopausal and currently using\nHT  and 21 788 were postmenopausal and not using HT\n Table 1  Premenopausal women were more likely to be\n\nnulliparous than postmenopausal women  Postmeno-\npausal women currently using HT were younger than\nthose who were not using HT  Among parous women \nthose who were premenopausal were older at the deliv-\nery of their first child  median = 28 years  than were\nwomen who were postmenopausal  median = 25 years \nPremenopausal women were less likely to have had a be-\nnign breast biopsy  a family history of breast cancer  con-\nsume a plant-based diet  or have more than one\nalcoholic drink  of around 20 g  per day  HT users were\nof a slightly higher socioeconomic status than non-users \nThe most parsimonious version of each of the\n\nvariables of interest which  when considered separately \npredicted ER+ breast cancer risk in each of the meno-\npausal/HT groups is shown in Table 2  A more detailed\nanalysis of these individual body size variables and post-\nmenopausal breast cancer risk in the CTS has been pub-\nlished previously [4]  Adolescent BMI was inversely\nrelated to premenopausal breast cancer  HR = 0 51  95%\nCI 0 31–0 86 for BMI ≥25 vs BMI <20  p trend = 0 006 \nAdult height was positively associated with risk of post-\nmenopausal breast cancer  HR = 1 19  95% CI 1 05–1 36\namong HT users  and HR = 1 20  95% CI 1 06–1 35\namong women not using HT  Breast cancer among\npostmenopausal women not using HT was also sig-\nnificantly associated with BMI at baseline and at the\n10-year follow up and weight change in both early  age\n18 years to baseline  and later  baseline to 10-year follow\nup  adulthood  The association between risk of breast can-\ncer and abdominal  WHtR ≥0 50  as opposed to gluteal\n WHtR <0 50  adiposity approached statistical significance \nFor each menopausal/HT group  we evaluated the as-\n\nsociation between ER+ breast cancer risk and the full\nspectrum of body size phenotypes  n = 16  defined by\nheight  adolescent BMI  baseline BMI  weight change be-\ntween age 18 years and age on joining the cohort  and\nabdominal adiposity  Table 3  Among premenopausal\nwomen  elevated HRs were observed among tall women\nwho experienced weight gain between age 18 and baseline \nbut whose adult BMI remained within the normal range\n HR = 2 02  95% CI 1 09–3 75  and short women who at\nbaseline were overweight/obese and who developed ab-\ndominal adiposity  HR = 2 47  95% CI 0 94–6 53  although\nthe latter estimate was not statistically significant  The lat-\nter estimate also did not significantly differ from that of\nsimilar women with gluteal adiposity  HR = 1 88  95% CI\n0 25–13 94  although both phenotypes were characterized\nby a very small number of cases \nAmong postmenopausal HT users  taller women who\n\nhad become overweight or obese during adulthood were\nat increased risk of

\n\nDiscussion\nOur analysis suggests that the relationships between\nbody size phenotypes  based on measures from adoles-\ncence through adulthood  and ER+ breast cancer are\ncomplex  We observed that the risk of premenopausal\nbreast cancer was influenced by adolescent  but not\nadult  body size  with greater body mass associated with\na reduction in risk  In addition  while becoming over-\nweight/obese in adulthood impacted the risk of post-\nmenopausal breast cancer  having been overweight/obese\nover life since adolescence did not  The use of HT sub-\nstantially increases breast cancer risk [16  17]  this risk\nwas increased further among those with the largest body\nstature  i e  those who were tall and overweight/obese \nAmong postmenopausal women not using HT  the re-\n\nlationship between body size and risk was complex  with\nthe largest effects of adiposity observed among short\nwomen  Among short women  while weight gain during\nadulthood resulting in abdominal adiposity increased\nrisk  gluteal adiposity was significantly more detrimental \nhowever  among tall women  body fat distribution did not\nmodify the risk associated with being overweight or obese\nin adulthood  Among short women  continued weight gain\nthroughout adulthood was also associated with a signifi-\ncant increase in risk  Height was associated with increased\nrisk  with borderline statistical significance \nOur findings on the associations between single body-\n\nsize measures and breast cancer risk  Table 2  were con-\nsistent with the general consensus in the literature [1] \nHowever  our life-course approach also suggests that\namong postmenopausal women currently using HT  the\npreviously observed overall increased risk associated\nwith greater height may in fact be limited to taller\nwomen who also have greater overall body mass  In\naddition  among postmenopausal women not using HT \nthe overall increased risk associated with abdominal adi-\nposity was not observed when height and adolescent\nbody mass were taken into account  This finding is con-\nsistent with the literature review published by Pischon et\nal  [7]  In fact  among short postmenopausal women\nwho became overweight or obese due to adult weight\ngain after age 18 years but prior to baseline  risk\nassociated with gluteal adiposity was substantially\ngreater than that due to abdominal adiposity  This\nfinding is consistent with the recent report by Harding et\nal  [18] suggesting that hip circumference may be a better\npredictor of postmenopausal breast cancer than waist\ncircumference \n\nApart from single measures assessed at different ages\nand reported separately  there is little literature on the\nlifetime effects of body size on breast cancer risk  Stud-\nies in France and Mexico have looked at body shape\ntrajectories from the prepubertal period to age 35 or\n40 years based on Sørensen’s pictograms [19  20]  In the\nFrench study  relative to women reporting the leanest\nbody shapes throughout life  women who consistently\nreported mid-range or the largest body shapes were at re-\nduced risk of ER+ progesterone-receptor-positive  PR+ \npostmenopausal breast cancer  women reporting greater\nbody size during adolescence than during adulthood were\nat similar risk but the effect estimate was not significantly\nsignificant [20]  The authors concluded that adiposity at\npuberty reduced the risk of later-life breast cancer and this\neffect was independent of later-life body size [20]  How-\never  the opposite was observed in the Mexican study \nwomen consistently reporting mid-range or the largest\nbody shapes and those reporting a moderate increase in\nbody shape size over time were at increased risk of post-\nmenopausal breast cancer [19]  Neither study found statis-\ntically significant associations with premenopausal breast\ncancer \nIn a similar analysis  conducted in the USA  assessing\n\ntrajectories from age 5 to 60 years  moderate or marked\nincreases in body size increased the risk of postmeno-\npausal breast cancer  but there was no increased risk\namong those whose body size was relatively stable\nthroughout life  regardless of their absolute body size [21] \nWhile these findings are not directly comparable to ours \nthe increased risk associated with adiposity acquired dur-\ning adulthood in the studies from Mexico  in which less\nthan 25% of women had ever used HT  and the USA  in\nwhich no heterogeneity by HT use was reported  is gener-\nally consistent with the patterns we observeS in postmen-\nopausal women who were not using HT \nUnlike adult-acquired body mass  several previous stud-\n\nies have found that being overweight/obese over lifetime\n i e  since adolescence  may not impact the risk of post-\nmenopausal breast cancer [4  9  10  20] or in some cases \nmay even reduce a woman’s risk [20]  Overall our findings\nare consistent with this observation  The implication of\nthese findings for more recent generations  however  is un-\nclear as the relative contribution of heredity  overeating \nsedentary behavior  and the altered hormone levels associ-\nated with each  to adolescent obesity may differ in these\nolder cohorts than in future ones  Despite our overall find-\nings on adolescent obesity  we did observe a significant in-\ncrease in risk limited to short women who were\noverweight/obese in adolescence but of normal adult body\nmass  The reason for this exception is not clear and may\nbe due to misclassification or chance \nMechanisms related to sex steroid hormones  inflamma-\n\ntion  and glucose/insulin are suggested as the pathways\n\nHorn-Ross et al  Breast Cancer Research   2016  18 132 Page 10 of 13\n\n\n\nmost likely to be involved in anthropometric-related car-\ncinogenesis [1  2  7]  Adult height in women is usually\nestablished by mid-adolescence and is a marker of aggre-\ngated fetal and childhood factors promoting linear growth \nincluding early-life nutrition and environmental exposures \nhormone profiles and the rate of sexual maturation  and\ngenetics [1  2] [22]  In premenopausal women the female\nsex steroid hormones are produced largely by the ovaries \nwhereas in postmenopausal women estrogens are largely\nthe result of the conversion of adrenal androgens to estro-\ngens in adipose tissue  Adolescent obesity is often associ-\nated with earlier menarche and irregular and anovulatory\nmenstrual cycles  resulting in altered levels of ovarian hor-\nmones  sex hormone binding globulin  and insulin-like\ngrowth factor-1 [2  6  20]  These alterations in turn may re-\nsult in earlier mammary cell differentiation and lifelong re-\nduction in mammary cell growth and proliferation\nreducing the risk of breast cancer later in life [2  13  20] \nWeight gain is an indicator of sustained positive energy\n\nbalance and  along with adult obesity  affects circulating\nhormones  growth factors  insulin  and inflammatory cyto-\nkines which together can increase carcinogenesis  decrease\napoptosis  and stimulate low-grade chronic inflammatory\nresponses [1  2  7  19]  Adult weight gain primarily reflects\nthe disposition of fat mass with abdominal fat associated\nwith impaired glucose metabolism  increased insulin re-\nsistance  and in postmenopausal women  altered estrogen\nsynthesis [1  6  7  13  23  24]  Abdominal adiposity is more\nclosely correlated with visceral adipose tissue  which is\nmore metabolically active  secreting more cytokines and\nhormones  than subcutaneous adipose tissue [7  24]  Glu-\nteal adipocytes  on the other hand  are more likely to be\nresponsive to female sex steroid hormones [25]  Finally \nexogenous HT may obscure the effect of adiposity on\nbreast cancer risk by artificially increasing the levels of cir-\nculating estrogens [6  23] \nSeveral limitations of the present analysis should be\n\nnoted  First  while determined a priori  our approach to\nand interpretation of the analysis is somewhat agnostic \nhas a certain degree of subjectivity  involves multiple com-\nparisons  and for some subgroups is based on small num-\nbers of cases  However  we used quantitative methods  i e \nthe Wald test  to determine whether specific subgroups dif-\nfered  While collapsing subgroups based on small numbers\nof cases may have masked some associations  this may also\nhave reduced over-interpretation of erroneous patterns \nSecond  we included only 16 body-size phenotypes in\n\nour analysis  Examining additional phenotypes  such as\nabsolute weight gain among women with who were over-\nweight or obese in adulthood  being overweight or obese\nover life  or body fat distribution among women of normal\nBMI  may be possible in larger consortial datasets \nThird  our focus was on body size over the life-course\n\nbut the available data limited us to evaluation at several\n\nspecific points in time only  i e  age 18 years  baseline\n generally reflecting ages 34–46 in premenopausal\nwomen  52–65 in postmenopausal women using HT \nand 55–72 in postmenopausal women not using HT \nand 10 years after baseline  and the changes between\nthese points \nFourth  while data on menopausal status and HT use\n\nwere updated  this was only done at 5-year and 10-year\nfollow up  rather than more often  and thus  has some\nbuilt-in imprecision  The largest change in HT use over\nthe follow-up period  however  was the substantial popu-\nlation cessation of HT use following the publicity sur-\nrounding the findings of the Women’s Health Initiative\nin 2002–2003 [16  17]  This event fell between our two\nfollow-up questionnaires  thus  women who quit use as\na result of this event contributed person-time and events\nto the current HT group for a few “extra” years as op-\nposed to being switched to the “not currently using HT”\ngroup immediately  which functionally precluded an as-\nsumption of instantaneous risk reduction  Relatedly \nsome misclassification may have been introduced into\nthe analysis of adult  baseline  BMI and WHtR in\nwomen who were premenopausal at baseline but post-\nmenopausal at the 5-year follow up  They would have\ncontributed person-time to one of the postmenopausal\nsubgroups between the 5-year and 10-year follow up \nbut unlike women who were postmenopausal at baseline\nor became postmenopausal after the 5-year follow up \ntheir adult BMI and WHtR data would have reflected a\npremenopausal assessment rather than a postmeno-\npausal one during the 5 years of the follow-up period \nHowever  these women accounted for only 10% and 15%\nof those contributing to the analyses of postmenopausal/\ncurrent HT and postmenopausal/not using HT groups \nrespectively  After the 10-year reassessment of both\nmenopausal status and body size  this would not have\nbeen a concern \nFifth  the anthropometric data used in the present ana-\n\nlysis were self-reported  which can result in measure-\nment error due to lack of knowledge  most notably for\nweight at age 18 years  or desire to report a socially\nmore normative value  However  our validation study\nsuggested excellent reproducibility and validity  minimiz-\ning such concerns [4]  Last  we did not include other\nbody size measures  such as weight cycling  which in\none study was found to be associated with the greatest\nrisk of breast cancer [5] \nNotable strengths of this analysis include the unique\n\nconceptual approach taken to assessing the effects of\nbody size over the life-course and the conduct of these\nanalyses in a large cohort of women who had detailed\ndata on anthropometry and breast cancer outcomes over\nthe course of more than 15 years  We included both dy-\nnamic  e g  weight change  and static measures  e g \n\nHorn-Ross et al  Breast Cancer Research   2016  18 132 Page 11 of 13\n\n\n\nBMI  of body size  of which the former may better re-\nflect age-related metabolic changes  while the latter re-\nflects the effects of absolute size [6]  In addition  when\nassessing abdominal  android  versus gluteal  gynoid \nobesity  we used the ratio of waist circumference to\nheight rather than the more common waist circumfer-\nence or waist-to-hip ratio  as the former is a better pre-\ndictor of visceral fat [12] \n\nConclusions\nTaking into account absolute body mass  changes in adi-\nposity over time  and body fat distribution  we identified\nlifetime  since adolescence  obesity phenotypes which\nwere associated with breast cancer risk in our large co-\nhort  These findings may aid in improving risk predic-\ntion models and developing targeted interventions  and\nmay clarify inconsistent findings across studies to the ex-\ntent that the composition of the study populations differ\nin regards to important anthropometric indicators  To\nthe extent that equally detailed anthropometry is avail-\nable in other studies  similar analyses conducted in large\nconsortial datasets  such as the Cohort Consortium or\nthe Harvard Diet Pooling Project  are needed to confirm\nour findings and improve statistical power for evaluating\neffect modification across rare phenotypes \n\nAbbreviations\nBMI  Body mass index  CCR  California Cancer Registry  CI  Confidence interval \nCTS  California

cancer \n\nMethods\nAll patients consulting for inflammatory breast syndrome in the breast unit of our tertiary Uni-\nversity hospital between September 2013 and December 2015 were prospectively included \nWe excluded women who were pregnant or in the postpartum period  Patients underwent\nsystematic clinical examination and imaging  breast ultrasonography and mammography \nA biopsy was performed if the clinician suspected a malignant lesion of the breast  Clinico-\npathologic and radiologic data were registered  Statistics were performed using R  3 0 2 ver-\nsion  software \n\nResults\nAmong the 76 patients screened and included  38  50%  had a malignant lesion at final diag-\nnosis  21  27 6%  were diagnosed with infectious disease and 17  22 4%  with

nonpuerperal inflammatory breast\n\nsyndrome  we found that half of the patients had IBC  While clinical and radiological features\n\nmay help initial diagnosis  they are non-specific and follow-up and biopsy are mandatory in\n\ncase of persisting inflammatory breast despite treatment \n\nThis high rate of IBC is an important finding especially as it contrasts with two previous\n\nmain studies reporting inflammatory breast syndrome [1  5]  In 2009  Kamal et al  [5] found\n\nthat 5 6% of patients had IBC in a cohort of 197 patients with mastitis  Similarly  Froman et al \n\n[1] reported a rate of 4 5% of IBC in a cohort of 23 patients presenting with red breast syndrome\n\nafter screening more than 3700 women presenting at their breast unit over a 2-year period  The\n\nfirst probable explanation for such a difference is that  unlike these two studies  we excluded\n\nwomen who were pregnant or in the postpartum period from our cohort  Inflammatory breast\n\nduring breastfeeding is common and does not represent a challenge either for diagnosis or for\n\nTable 5  MRI analysis \nCharacteristics Number of patients\n\n n = 20 \nMissing data Infectious\n\n n = 1 \nInflammatory\n n =

improving management of women suffering with inflammatory breast syndrome \n\nWe believe that the high rate of IBC we report here is probably closer to what clinicians may\n\nencounter in everyday practice \n\nThe clinical distinction between true IBC and neglected breast cancer progression may\n\nprove delicate in some cases  This distinction is clinically relevant since the treatment strategy\n\nmight differ  In our cohort  we cannot exclude that some of the cases of IBC were in fact cases\n\nof neglected cancer progression  Some authors report clinical diagnostic differences between\n\nthese two scenario that are easily picked up on during physical examination [7  12–14]  For\n\nexample  patients with IBC may experience a rapid increase in breast volume almost simulta-\n\nneously with the skin changes which are highly evocative of IBC  in our cohort  skin thickening\n\nand indurated skin was observed in 55% and 73% of women with IBC  respectively  Most\n\npatients with IBC do not present a palpable mass on physical examination [14]  In our cohort \n\nhowever  the most relevant symptom suggestive of malignancy at the time of the consultation\n\nwas the perception of a mass  78 9%  on physical examination  Therefore  while this sign may\n\nbe unusual in IBC  any perception of a mass by the patient or the clinician warrants further\n\ninvestigation including systematic breast or skin biopsy in case of doubt \n\nBreast ultrasonography and a mammography were particularly useful diagnostic tools in\n\nour cohort  On ultrasonography  the only factor significantly associated with IBC was the pres-\n\nence of precise limits of the mass  Other authors report similar results [5  15]  However  a nor-\n\nmal ultrasonography does not in itself rule out IBC  Indeed  Gunhan et al  [16] reported\n\nabsence of a mass in 20% of authentic cases of IBC and no skin changes in 4% of those cases \n\nMammography is usually less specific to differentiate between mastitis and IBC  Crowe et al \n\n[17] reported that the most relevant sign of IBC was diffuse skin thickening  Mammography\n\nwas highly relevant in our cohort  As mentioned before  the presence of a mass  of calcifica-\n\ntions or of a focal asymmetry were significantly associated with a malignant lesion though not\n\nspecific of IBC  Several authors have assessed the performance of MRI for the diagnosis of IBC\n\n[16  18–20]  This exam is usually prescribed after ultrasonography and mammography in case\n\nof doubt  Sixteen patients with IBC underwent a breast MRI in our cohort  Presence of mass \n\nlocal enhancement and suspicious lymph nodes were strongly evocative of a malignant lesion \n\nWhile some authors [1  3] have developed algorithms for the management of inflammatory\n\nbreast  we believe that the need for such an algorithm is questionable  The main issue at hand\n\nis to rapidly identify all cases of IBC  a particularly aggressive cancer  in women presenting\n\nwith inflammatory breast syndrome  Unfortunately  our data were limited regarding the time\n\nlapse between first clinical contact and the diagnostic of an IBC in our cohort and we were not\n\nable to assess the efficiency of the management of such patients using French guidelines  Once\n\nIBC is identified  it should be treated as an emergency  Our efforts should thus focus on cor-\n\nrectly identifying these patients at high risk of metastasis and progression  We have identified\n\nfactors strongly associated with IBC which would allow clinicians to diagnose IBC in women\n\npresenting with inflammatory breast syndrome \n\nConclusion\nIBC is prevalent in women presenting with non-puerperal inflammatory breast syndrome and\n\nshould be the major concern of clinicians managing these patients  Clinical and imaging exam-\n\nination may be helpful for this purpose but further investigation by breast biopsy should be\n\nundertaken if the slightest doubt remains  We are currently developing a nomogram based on\n\nour results to identifying these high-risk patients with an aim to accelerate appropriate man-\n\nagement in this emergency setting \n\nA non-puerperal inflammatory breast cohort\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0189385 December 20  2017 9 / 11\n\n\n\n\nSupporting

Ire-\nland that introduced a screening programme eight years apart  and to estimate the steady-\nstate mortality deficits the programme will produce  We carried out age- and year-matched\nbetween-region comparison of breast cancer mortality rates  and of incidence rates of stage\n2–4 breast cancer  in the eligible cohorts  The regions comprised counties that  beginning in\nearly 2000  region 1  and late 2007  region 2  invited women aged 50–64 to biennial mam-\nmography screening  The data were supplied by the National Cancer Registry  Central Sta-\ntistics Office  As impact measures  we used age-and-year-matched mortality  from breast\ncancers diagnosed from 2000 onwards  rate ratios and incidence rate ratios in the com-\npared regions from 2000 to 2013  Ratios were adjusted for between-region differences in\nbackground rates  In cohorts too old to be invited  death rates in regions 1 and 2 were 702\nper 0 91 and 727 per 0 90 million women-years respectively  Ratio 0 96  In the eligible\ncohorts  they were 1027 per 2 9 and 1095 per 2 67  Ratio 0 88  Thus  rates in cohorts that\ncould have benefitted were 9% lower in region 1 than region 2   95%CI  -20%  +4%  The\nincidence rates of stage 2–4 breast cancer were 7% lower in region 2 than region 1 over the\nentire 14 year period  and 20% lower in 2007  i e  before the screening in region 2 began to\nnarrow the difference  Since mortality reductions due to screening only manifest after sev-\neral years  the full impact of screening has not yet been realized in region 1  The lower rate\nobserved in that region is a conservative estimate of the steady state benefit  Additional\ndeaths would have been averted had screening continued beyond age 64 \n\nIntroduction\nUntil recently  mortality reductions in randomized trials carried out 20–40 years ago were the\n\nonly evidence for mammography screening  Since these trials  many countries have introduced\n\nmammography screening

persons diagnosed with cancer in\n\nIreland  The use of these data for research is\n\ncovered by the Statutory Instrument which\n\nestablished the Registry Board in 1991  Data on\n\ncause of death was accessed via the NCRI under\n\nan agreement with the Office of the Registrar  Civil\n\nRegistration Service  All datasets were anonymised\n\nprior to analysis  As stated in the data release\n\npolicy stated on their website  https //www ncri ie/\n\ncontent/confidentiality  The National Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmay  however  have resulted from concomitant improvements in breast cancer management\n\nand treatment  A number of more complex designs  most commonly using a separate geo-\n\ngraphical area that did not introduce screening as a control  have been used to attempt to sepa-\n\nrate the effect of screening from the effect of improved treatment [1 2] \n\nUsing a ‘parallel’ design  a 2011 study [3] compared trends in mortality from breast cancer\n\nin three pairs of neighbouring European countries with similar population structures  socio-\n\neconomic characteristics and access to treatment but where one country implemented a\n\nscreening programme by 1990 with a later implementation in the matched country  It reported\n\nthat Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland had similar reductions in age-standardized\n\nbreast cancer mortality rates in the period 1989 to 2006  29% vs  26%  even though screening\n\nwas introduced in Northern Ireland in 1990 and only in the eastern region of the Republic of\n\nIreland in 2000  Unfortunately  the authors only had information on the age and year of death \n\nSince they did not use incidence-files  available from cancer registries  that would have pro-\n\nvided the year the cancer was diagnosed  their analysis included many deaths in women who\n\ncould not have benefitted from the screening programme introduced to the first of the pair of\n\ncountries  e g  those who by the age/year it began  were either too old  or had already been\n\ndiagnosed with breast cancer  Thus  by ignoring this first principle of cancer screening  their\n\nestimates of the benefit of the earlier introduction are greatly diluted \n\nWhat have come to be known as ‘incidence based’ mortality studies [4] avoid this bias by\n\nfocusing on the mortality from breast cancer diagnosed only after the first invitation to screen-\ning and excluding deaths in women who could not benefit from the screening program i e \nwhose cancers were diagnosed before screening was initiated  The term ‘incidence-based’ is a\n\ncontraction of the more informative “incidence-file based mortality” term introduced by Chu\n\net al  in 1994 [5]  The 2012 review of such studies  reported a breast cancer mortality reduction\n\nof 26%  95% confidence interval 13–36%  among women invited for screening and followed\n\nup for 6–11 years [6] \n\nA country with a phased rollout of screening provides the opportunity for a geographical\n\ncontrol group within the same country  Denmark and Norway are often referred to as ‘model\n\ncountries’ for this type of comparison with the first phase of screening in Denmark offered to\n\n20% of the target population in 1991–93 and a national rollout taking place between 2007 and\n\n2010 [1 2]  Norway commenced screening in four counties in 1995 with a gradual expansion\n\nto the remaining 15 counties by 2005 [7 8] \n\nThe Republic of Ireland has a more recent history of a phased rollout of mammography\n\nscreening with screening introduced in half of the country in 2000  Phase 1  in “Region 1’  and\n\nthe West and the South of the country only initiating screening at the end of 2007  Phase 2  in\n\n‘Region 2’  The program has two unusual features  screening is only until age 64  and the two\n\nregions involve similar sized populations  The primary objective of our study was to compare\n\nthe contemporary breast cancer death rates in the two regions using data from the Irish\n\nNational Cancer Registry on all breast cancer diagnoses since the first invitation to screening \n\nin women aged 50–85  while correcting for any difference in the contemporaneous ‘back-\n\nground’ rates between the geographic regions involved in the two phases  Although differences\n\nin mortality are the most trustworthy metric  the delay between when screening is carried out\n\nand when mortality reductions become evident is long and variable  A second objective was\n\ntherefore to use the incidence of stage 2–4 tumours  as a possible ‘leading indicator’ of the ulti-\n\nmate mortality reductions  Our third objective was methodological  we bring out the critical\n\nissue of ‘timing’ in any observed reductions in mortality or incidence of stage 2–4 tumours\n\n[9 10 11] by graphically representing the incidence rates and varying number of rounds of\n\nscreening invitations received over time by different birth cohorts  the graphs

graphical displays to remind readers of the prin-\n\nciples underlying cancer screening \n\nMethods\nBreastCheck–the Irish breast cancer screening programme\nFollowing a pilot programme in the Dublin Region [12]  the Republic of Ireland National\n\nBreast Screening Programme  BreastCheck  commenced in February 2000 for women aged 50\n\nto 64 in the East of the country covering about 50% of the eligible population  The programme\n\nis by invitation  by district electoral division and county  to all women in this age range every\n\ntwo years and is free of charge  Eleven of the 26 counties commenced the programme in 2000 \n\nfollowed by a further three counties from 2004–2006  The remaining twelve counties in the\n\nWest and South of the country commenced screening in December 2007  The target popula-\n\ntion acceptance rate of an invitation to screening has remained relatively stable over time rang-\n\ning from 68% to 76% of those invited [13] \n\nBreastCheck has offered a fully digitalised mammography service since 2008  Screening\n\nmammograms are taken in mobile digital screening units around the country or in dedicated\n\nunits attached to local hospitals  Two view mammograms are taken and independently\n\nassessed by two consultant radiologists  Programme standards are based on European and\n\nnational Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening[14 15] with radiolo-\n\ngists required to read a minimum of 5 000 screening cases per year and have specific training\n\nin mammography  Women with abnormal results are invited for further investigation at an\n\nassessment clinic in the nearest screening unit  These investigations may include a further\n\nmammogram  ultrasound or biopsy  Women diagnosed with breast cancer are then referred to\n\na multidisciplinary team \n\nThe Irish National Cancer Registry\nThe Irish National Cancer Registry began collecting data on all cancer diagnoses in the Repub-\n\nlic of Ireland in 1994  Tumour registration officers are based in hospitals around the country\n\nand actively register new diagnoses  Most cases are identified through histopathology reports\n\nbut the Registry also obtains records held in radiotherapy and oncology units  the hospital in-\n\npatient episodes  HIPE  database and death certificates  Death certificates are provided by the\n\nCentral Statistics Office \n\nCompleteness of case ascertainment by the Registry for breast cancer for women in the\n\nscreening age group of 50–64 is estimated to be greater than 99%  through independent case\n\nascertainment with BreastCheck records [16] \n\nData and contrasts\nWe used data from the National Cancer Registry on all women aged 50–85  diagnosed with\n\nbreast cancer from 2000 to 2013 and resident in the Republic of Ireland at the time of diagno-\n\nsis  The diagnoses were linked with death certificates with follow up to the end of 2013 to\n\nascertain date and cause of death \n\nBased on the county of residence at diagnosis  women were classified as having lived in\n\nRegion 1 which consisted of the eleven counties  mostly in the East  which began screening in\n\n2000 or Region 2 which consisted of the twelve counties which began at the end of 2007  in the\n\nWest and South  County of residence at diagnosis is assumed to reflect county of residence at\n\ninvitation to screening  The 2011 census of the population reported 303 327 women aged 50 to\n\n85 in counties comprising Region 1 and 282 736 women aged 50 to 85 in counties comprising\n\nMortality reductions due to mammography screening  Contemporary population-based data\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188947 December 20  2017 3 / 14\n\n\n\n\nRegion 2  Quintiles of deprivation were derived from data in the 2002 census at electoral divi-\n\nsion level  and applied to individual women by linkage of address [17]  Within each quintile \n\nwe also compared the age-standardised breast cancer mortality rates for the five years  1995–\n\n1999  before BreastCheck began \n\nAll deaths attributed to breast cancers diagnosed since the year 2000  at ages of 50–84  in\n\nwomen in these two regions are included in the analysis  representing 94% of all breast cancer\n\ndeaths in women aged 50–85 nationally in the time period of interest  The remaining 6% of\n\ndeaths occurred in the three counties who introduced screening in 2004–2006 \n\nThe tumour registry only began collecting data in 1994  so we could not use ‘historical’ con-\n\ntrol groups such as those used in the studies from Denmark or Norway  Instead  we used ‘par-\n\nallel’ control groups  and compared contemporary death rates in the two regions  but in\n\nwomen too old to benefit from a screening program limited to those aged 50–64 \n\nStatistical analysis\nAll graphics and calculations were custom-programmed in R  We used Lexis diagrams to display\n\nthe basic data and to illustrate and report the results of the contrasts  To address our first aim  we\n\ncarried out two  ‘invitation-to-screen’  between-region contrasts  one rate ratio measured the\n\namalgam of the effect of the earlier Region 1 screening and any inherent between-region differ-\n\nences in mortality rates even in the absence of screening  the other rate ratio measured just the\n\nregional difference in these ‘background’ mortality rates  caused by any regional differences in\n\nincidence or in quality of treatment  We then used the ‘double difference’  a ratio of rate ratios  to\n\nestimate the ‘net’ difference attributable to the earlier introduction of screening in Region 1 \n\nThus  the first contrast involved breast cancer mortality rates in the lower portion of the\nLexis diagrams  i e  among women who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer by the age\n\nof 50  or by the year 2000  and were aged between 50 and 64 at some time between 2000 and\n\nthe end of 2013  A summary Mantel-Haenszel rate ratio was computed using the 301 individ-\n\nual age-year cells as separate strata  and the variance of the log of this summary rate ratio was\n\ncomputed using the formula given in Breslow and Day [18]  Since the imbalances were mini-\n\nmal  the variance can be approximated as 1/D1 + 1/D0  where D1 and D0  are the overall num-\n\nbers of deaths in the compared regions  The rate ratio for the second contrast  along with the\n\nvariance of its log  was computed in the same way using the 203 cells in the upper portion of\nthe Lexis diagrams  i e  in the years lived by women aged 65 or older in 2000 who  likewise  had\n\nnot been diagnosed with breast cancer by then  but were too old to benefit from a screening\n\nprogram that only extended to age 64   Again  with 0 denoting the second contrast  the variance\n\nis well approximated by 1/D1\n0 + 1/D0\n\n0  Displayed ratios have been rounded to two decimal\n\nplaces  The variance of the log of the ratio of ratios  calculated as the sum of the two already-\n\ncomputed variances  was used to compute a confidence interval to accompany the point esti-\n\nmate of the ‘net’ reduction  This sum of variances is well approximated by the ‘Woolf-like’ for-\n\nmula  1/D1 + 1/D0 + 1/D1\n0 + 1/D0\n\n0  and shows that the width of the ultimate confidence\n\ninterval is determined by the smallest of the 4 counts \n\nWe also converted the  age-and-year-matched  double difference into an absolute number\n\nof deaths  so that the estimated number of invitations to avert one death from breast cancer\n\ncould be determined \n\nTo emphasize the time-patterns peculiar to cancer screening  and which ages in which\n\nyears would be affected by screening  we plotted the location  in calendar time  age  and ‘years\n\nsince last screening invitation’ of the numbers of deaths involved in each rate ratio in a sepa-\n\nrate figure  To bring out the patterns more clearly  we reduced the statistical noise by averaging\n\nthe numbers of deaths in adjacent cells of the Lexis diagram \n\nMortality reductions due to mammography screening  Contemporary population-based data\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188947 December 20  2017 4 / 14\n\n\n\n\nSince only about 70% of invitees participated  the resulting ‘invitation to screen’ reduction\n\nis an average of the maximal effect in these 70% and the null reduction in the 30%  If one\n\nassumed that  had they participated  the 30% would have benefited to the same extent as the\n\n70%  one can calculate that the reduction is approximately 100/70 = 1 4 times what is seen in\n\nthe ‘invitation to screen’ analysis  We also addressed this ‘efficacy’ measure  since it is the rele-\n\nvant number for women who plan to participate fully \n\nTo address our second and third objectives  we also used the between-region differences in\n\nincidence of stage 2–4 breast cancer as a ‘leading indicator’ of later mortality differences  The\n\nshorter lag between screening and the expected reductions in incidence—and the larger num-\n\nbers of ‘events’—allowed us to examine the time patterns in more detail than was possible with\n\nmortality \n\nWe analysed the patterns in two ways  First  we restricted the analysis to the 8 years 2000–\n\n2007  i e  before screening began in Region 2  We grouped the Lexis cells both by attained-age\n\nand by birth-cohort  and used Poisson regression and Joinpoint regression [19] to compute\n\nwithin-region annual changes in each of seven ‘bands’  each 5 years wide  Second  we examined\nthe between-region differences by computing 14 year-specific Mantel-Haenszel summary rate\nratios  each one matched on attained age  In addition  in order to obtain smooth-in-time rate\n\nratios  we used conditional Poisson regression  By fixing the total number of stage 2–4 cancers\n\nin an  age-at-diagnosis  year-of-diagnosis  Lexis cell  the number of them that arose from\n\nRegion 1 can be treated as a binomial random variable [20]  The Region1  Region2 split within\n\nthe cell is determined by the underlying ratio of the ‘background’ incidence rates in the two\n\nregions  the respective numbers of women-years they contribute  and the ‘net’ rate ratio–\n\nwhich itself can be modelled as constant-in or varying-in time [19] The rate ratio for cell  a y \n\nhas as its null value  unity  the rate of stage 2–4 tumours that  in the absence of a screening\n\nprogram  would have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 at age ‘a’ in year ‘y’  A ratio below unity indi-\n\ncates what fraction of these tumours would  despite the earlier invitations to screening  still\nhave been diagnosed at stage 2–4 at age ‘a’ in year ‘y’ at this same age/year  One minus this rate\n\nratio can thus be interpreted as the fraction of the initial ‘target’ that  as a result of the uptake\n\nof screening invitations  was detected in an earlier year—at stage 1 rather than at stage 2–4 \n\nBy way of orientation to the results  Fig 1 shows  for one selected birth cohort in Region 2 \n\nthe breast cancer deaths that a full screening program  i e  had it started in that region in 2000 \nmight have averted  Nine thousand women aged 54 residing in that region in 2000 only\nreceived their first  and last  invitation s  to screening at age s  62  and 64  Over the 14 years\n\nfrom the beginning of 2000 until the end of 2013  a fatal breast cancer shortened the lives of\n\nsome sixty six of these nine thousand women  some of these premature deaths  occurring\n\nbefore the women reached their late sixties  might have been averted had screening invitations\n\ncommenced at age 54  or 50  and moved the diagnosis and treatment to an earlier age/date \n\nResults\nThe insets in Fig 2 show a summary of deprivation and the extent of each region  The higher\n\nproportion in the least deprived quintile in region 1 are mostly resident in or close to the larg-\n\nest city  Dublin  However  there was no consistent relation between quintiles of deprivation\n\nand rates of breast cancer mortality from 1995–99  Moreover  age-standardized mortality rates\n\nin the two regions in these 5 years pre-BreastCheck were quite similar to each other \n\nThe main part of Fig 2 illustrates the numbers of screening invitations  ranging from none\n\nto seven  received by women in different birth-cohorts and Regions  In the age cohorts that\n\nwere too old to be invited to screening [thus serving as a check on the comparability of the\n\n‘background’ rates in two regions]  the death rates in Region 1 and Region 2 were 702 per 0 91\n\nMortality reductions due to mammography screening  Contemporary population-based data\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188947

attributed to the additional eight years of screening in Region\n1 is approximately 9%  95% confidence interval  a 20% reduction to a 4% increase \n\nIn absolute terms  the estimated number of deaths averted thus far by the additional eight years\nof screening  and 600 thousand more invitations to screening  if each invitation to one woman is\n\ncounted as a separate invitation  in Region 1 is approximately 9 percent of 1095  or 100 \n\nTo emphasize the complex time-patterns peculiar to cancer screening  and to highlight the\n\nage-window in which any additional mortality deficits generated by the planned extension of\n\nscreening to age 69 would manifest  Fig 3 shows the location  in calendar time  age  and ‘years\n\nsince last screening invitation’ of the numbers of deaths involved in each rate ratio  The small\n\nnumbers of deaths in the early years reflect the ‘incidence-based’ nature of the comparisons \n\nthese occurred only a few years after diagnosis  The age locations of the later deaths in the as-\n\nyet-largely-unscreened counties in Region 2 provide a guide to the ages  several years earlier \n\nat which screening-induced earlier treatment might have averted some of these deaths  Thus \nfor example  in the years 2010–2013 in Region 2  some 120 women died of breast cancer aged\n\n72–76  None of their cohorts had been invited to screening  In the corresponding years and\n\nages in region 1  some 116 died  the last invitation to their cohorts was when they were aged 64\n\ni e  8 to 12 years earlier  The data in Fig 3 can also be used to determine the age at which the\n\nlast screen would need to be to avert a portion of the still considerable numbers of deaths in\n\nwomen in their late 70s \n\nTable 1 shows the time-patterns in the incidence of stage 2–4 breast cancer over the first 8\n\nyears in each Region  In each of the 3 ‘horizontal’ and 4 ‘diagonal’ bands  the annual incidence\n\ndecreased in Region 1 and increased in Region 2  the results obtained by conventional Poisson\n\nregression and Joinpoint regression were identical \n\nOver all 14 years in the 301 Lexis cells that could have been affected by screening  there\n\nwere 5209 new cases of stage 2–4 breast cancer in the 2 90 million WY in Region 1  and 5117\n\nin the 2 67 million WY in Region 2  age-and year-matched Mantel-Haenszel rate ratio  0 94 \n\nAdjusted for the  background  1% higher Region-1 incidence in the 203 Lexis cells that could\n\nnot have been affected by screening  the stage 2–4 incidence rate in those women who could\n\nhave benefitted was thus 7% lower in Region 1 than Region 2  However  as is seen in Fig 4 \n\nthat 7% ‘deficit’ is a not very meaningful average of the 14 year-specific impacts of the earlier\n\nscreening in Region 1 than Region 2  The 20% Region1-Region2 difference in 2007 reflects the\n\n‘deficit’ of stage 2–4 cancers in Region 1 in that year  the number that–in the absence of screen-\n\ning would have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 in 2007—had already been detected at an earlier\n\nstage in screening rounds 1–3 held in 2000–2005  This a 20% deficit is a good estimate of the\n\nlong-term Region1-Region2 differences that would have been seen had Region 2 not begun\n\nscreening at all  The narrowing of the differences in the final 5 years reflects the later Region 2\n\nstart  as time progresses  the 2 curves will converge \n\nAlso included in the overall 7% difference is the higher rate of stage 2–4 cancers in Region 1\nrelative to Region 2 in the first 4 years  This also makes sense  Screening can detect stage 1 can-\n\ncers that would otherwise have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 in a later year  but each round of\n\nscreening  and especially the first few rounds  also detects stage 2–4 cancers that would other-\n\nwise have been diagnosed at stage 2–4 in a later year  A similar rise in the incidence of stage\n\n2–4 cancers is evident in Region 2 when screening began there \n\ncomparison limited

potential harmful effects such as over-diagnosis \n\nthose who fund organized mammography screening programs need to know how many future\n\nbreast cancer deaths will be averted by them  The best estimates of benefit are to be found in\n\nthe quasi-experimental data from contemporary population-based screening programs \n\nWhereas all ‘big data’ need to be analysed carefully  cancer screening data  whether from the\n\ntrials of decades ago or populations this millennium  need to be analysed even more carefully \n\nto take account of the delayed returns on investment and other time-dependent features that\n\nare peculiar to cancer screening  Thus  we made extensive use of graphical displays and sum-\n\nmarized the data using matching rather than modelling \n\nA synthesis in 2012 of the highest quality quasi-experimental studies–all based on inci-\n\ndence-based data—put the ‘best estimate’ of breast cancer mortality reduction produced by\n\nEuropean service mammography screening programmes at 26% [6]  One contribution to this\n\nestimate were the D1 = 223 and D1 = 438 breast cancer deaths in the 10 years after/before\n\nscreening was introduced to Copenhagen [1]  These two counts were the biggest component\n\nof the width of the confidence interval  D1 = 223  D0 = 2 333  D1\n0 = 438  D0\n\n0 = 2 123  Since the\n\nreview  two additional data points have been added  The data from Norway  with 1 175 deaths\n\nin the 4 to 14 years after screening was introduced in the different counties  yielded a point\n\nestimate of 28% with the width of the CI determined by D1 = 1 175 and D0 = 8 996 [6]  The\n\nother data point was from the Funen area of Denmark with an estimate of 22% based on the\n\n14 years after/before screening was introduced  D1 = 416  D0 = 566  D1\n0 = 4 246  D0\n\n0 = 4 111 \n\n[2] \n\nThe numbers of screening invitations issued to women in these areas followed the same pat-\n\ntern as on the left half of our Fig 2  No area had yet reached the steady state where every cohort\n\nhad been invited since age 50  up until age 69  and followed until the full benefits of these\n\nscreens–expected to be centred on the ages 55 to 75 or so–had been expressed  Thus the esti-\n\nmated reductions measure only a portion of what will be achieved in steady state  and each\n\nTable 1  For each region  attained-age- and birth-cohort-specific annual

difference\n\nbetween the regions involved in the two phases thus far be interpreted  The first difference is\n\nthat the close to 50 50 sample size ratio in the two regions makes for a small variance  D1 =\n\n1 027  D0 = 1 095 D1\n0 = 702  D0\n\n0 = 727  The second is that the correction in the double differ-\nence involves contemporary  post year 2000 only  rather than historical data  The closeness of\nthe background rates in the women who were too old for the screening program reduces the\n\nrisk of mixing mortality differences produced by screening and ones caused by regional differ-\n\nences in quality of care  Third  the Republic of Ireland is one of the few EU countries to have\n\nlimited screening to women aged 50–64  rather than to those aged 50–69 as recommended by\n\nthe Council of the European Union [21]  the program will now be extended to include all\n\nwomen from 50–69 by 2021 \n\nThe 9% regional difference seen thus far in Ireland measures how much of an advantage\n\nwomen in Region 1 have achieved thus far  i e  in the 14 years  over their Region 2 counter-\n\nparts  or their own counterfactuals  by having had access to organized screening almost 8 years\nsooner  The full effect in Region 1  when all cohorts have received all 8 invitations  from age 50\nto 64  could eventually be estimated indirectly if Region 2 had delayed its introduction  not for\n\n8  but for say 20–25 years  Given our inexact knowledge as to the timing of the delayed cancer\n\nscreening dividends  it is not possible to precisely extrapolate from the estimated 9% achieved\n\nthis far with a lead of 8 years  to an estimate based on a  hypothetical  phase 1 lead of 20–25\n\nyears  However  one might extrapolate from the differences seen with the 10 and 14 year leads\n\nin the two Danish studies  as long as one allows for the shorter ‘age-reach’ of the Irish program\n\n and its inability to avert most of the deaths that occur in women aged from the early 70s\n\nonwards  One should also allow for the initial phase 1 challenges in achieving full coverage\n\nand a 21–27 month cycle  Based on all of these considerations  it seems reasonable to project\n\nthat had the Region 1 lead been 20–25 years  their advantage over Region 2 in these years would\nhave been close to 20%–the remit of the program [13] \n\nWhen magnified by a factor of 100/70 so that it refers to the benefit of full participation in\n\nregion 1  the projection is closer to 30% \n\nThe observed 9% difference that drives these estimates might have been attenuated by the\n\nphase 1 start up challenges  and by greater opportunistic screening in Region 2—prompted by\n\nawareness of the program in Region 1  and paid for by private health insurance  But this is off-\n\nset by the possibly greater access to treatment in Region 1 pre 2008  when treatment pathways\n\nwere linked to the screening programme  Centres of clinical excellence for cancer treatment\n\nwere more common post 2008 \n\nIn addition to reporting the first 21st century-only screening data thus far  this paper high-\n\nlights an important but neglected principle in the analysis of cancer screening data  The effects\n\nof cancer screening are not like those of adult circumcision  where the resulting protection\n\nagainst HIV acquisition is immediate and lifelong  or one-time screening for abdominal aortic\n\naneurysms [22]  where the full benefits are already evident in year 2  and persist for at least a\n\ndecade  To estimate the full effects of this activity/intervention  a difference of a year or two\n\nbetween starting phase 1 and 2 would have been more than adequate  to directly see the full\n\nmortality effects of eight rounds of every second year screening  a lead of perhaps 20–25 years\n\nis necessary \n\nThe central role of timing and the difference in outlook between therapeutics and screening\n\nis further exemplified in the question of extending mammography screening from the ages of\n\n50–64 to 50–69  When considering the implications of the last screening invitation being at\n\nage 69 rather than at age 64  it is more instructive to work backwards  Suppose that  in the\nabsence of screening  a cancer had proved fatal at age 74  if there had been just one opportunity\nto screen for that cancer  at what age would it have been optimal to do so  What if there had\n\nMortality reductions due to mammography screening  Contemporary population-based data\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188947 December 20  2017 12 / 14\n\n\n\n\nbeen more than one  The patterns in Fig 2 and the raw data in Fig 3 illustrate why mortality\n\ndata related to cancer screening  whether derived from old trials or newer quasi-experimental\n\nstudies  need to be very carefully considered  Few analyses or meta-analyses to date have con-\n\nsidered these core screening questions  how long after the beginning of screening do the mor-\n\ntality deficits manifest themselves  How long after the cessation of screening do the mortality\n\ndeficits disappear  In each trial  how many rounds were there and how long was the follow-\n\nup  In light of these  what does a single average data from trials of varying screening duration\n\nand varying follow-up periods mean  And to whom does it apply \n\nThe reductions produced by cancer screening cannot be summarized using a single number\n\n the remit of the BreastCheck program was “reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20% in\n\nten years”  but must be arrayed in time along both of the dimensions used in these Figs  More-\n\nover  the cells must not be grouped merely by horizontal age-bands  as is commonly done \n\nWomen must also be followed  along the diagonals of the Lexis diagram  into subsequent age-\nbands  The good that screening at age 64 does only becomes apparent  as a mortality deficit  in\n\nsubsequent age bands  These principles should be used to interpret not just these latest data\nfrom Ireland  but all of the trial and population data to date \n\nReductions in the incidence of stage 2–4 tumours are not a prefect surrogate for the ulti-\n\nmate reduction in mortality  But the sharper and more immediate patterns are an important\n\nindicator  given that the gap between the two regions was only 8 years  Thus  the 20% ‘deficit’\n\nin incidence of these tumours in Region 1  just before Region 2 began screening  is an encour-\n\naging finding \n\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization  James A  Hanley  Ailish

for meta-\nstatic estrogen receptor  ER -positive and human epithermal growth factor 2  HER2 -nega-\ntive breast cancer  The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in\nTNBC cells  Retinoblastoma  RB  a known substrate of CDK4/6  pathway deregulation is a\nfrequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhi-\nbition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC mod-\nels  In addition  recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical\nefficacy in androgen-receptor  AR -positive TNBC cells  Here we examined the effect of pal-\nbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells \n\nMethod\nMDA-MB-453  BT-549  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell

cytometry \n\nResults\nPalbociclib showed inhibitory effect in RB-proficient TNBC cells  and enzalutamide inhibited\ncell viability in AR-positive TNBC cells  Enzalutamide treatment could enhance the palbociclib-\ninduced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells  In addition  palbociclib-medi-\nated G1 arrest in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells was attenuated by RB knockdown

AR antagonists \n\nIntroduction\nTriple-negative breast cancer  TNBC  remains a challenging breast cancer subtype for its\n\nhigher risk of distant recurrence  and poorer outcome after recurrence or metastasis than\n\nother types of breast cancer [1–3]  Targeted therapy for TNBC is emerging in clinical trials and\n\nrecent molecular profiling studies have revealed molecular heterogeneity of TNBC [4] \n\nhighlighting the importance of finding biomarkers for targeted therapy guidance for TNBC \n\nPalbociclib is a highly selective cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6  CDK4/6  inhibitor \n\nwhich blocks the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein  pRB  and subsequently arrests\n\ncell cycle at G1-phase [5  6]  Previous study in vitro showed that palbociclib in combination\nwith hormone therapy  tamoxifen  or target therapy  trastuzumab  had an effectively inhibi-\n\ntory effect on ER-positive and HER2-amplified breast cancer  respectively [7]  In clinical  pal-\n\nbociclib in combination with letorzole  aromatase inhibitor  has been approved by the U S \n\nFood and Drug Administration  FDA  for the treatment of patients with ER-positive and\n\nHER2-negative advanced breast cancer [8  9]  However  the effects of palbociclib in TNBC are\n\nnot well-documented \n\nEnzalutamide  an androgen receptor antagonist  has been approved by the FDA for the\n\ntreatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer [10  11]  Cumulative evidences showed\n\nthat enzalutamide has potent anti-tumor effects on TNBC cells  and suggested that androgen\n\nreceptor  AR  might be a promising target for treatment of TNBC [12–14]  However  the effect\n\nof combination palbociclib with enzalutamide in TNBC cells is still unclear \n\nIn present study  we tested the combination effect of palbociclib with enzalutamide in\n\nTNBC cells  Cytostatic effects of enzalutamide  palbociclib or combined treatment and effects\n\nof treatments on AR and pRB proteins expressions were examined  Moreover  the influences\n\non cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were also evaluated \n\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and transfection\nHuman TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-453

leads to inhibition of cell growth  we evaluated the effect of palbociclib in three\n\nTNBC cell lines  The result showed that palbociclib significantly inhibited the cell growth in RB-\n\nproficient cells  MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231  but not in RB-negative cells  MDA-MB-\n\n468   Fig 2A  Enzalutamide-suppressed cell viability of AR-positive cells is nearly 50%  Fig 2B \n\nTo examine whether enzalutamide enhanced palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect  we used 0 156\n\nor 2 5 μM palbociclib combined with various concentrations of enzalutamide in TNBC cell lines \nThe results revealed that enzalutamide enhanced the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-\n\npositive/RB-proficient  MDA-MB-453  cells rather than AR-positive/RB-negative  BT-549 \n\nAR-negative/RB-proficient

BT-\n549  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with various concentrations of palbociclib   B  enzalutamide and  C  combination of 0 156 or 2 5 μM\npalbociclib and 10 or 20 μM enzalutamide for 72 h  the cell viability was determined using MTT assay  The means ± SEM of three independent experiments\nperformed in triplicate are shown  *P   10%\n\nnuclear staining [32]  The level of RB1 mRNA correlated with level of pRB [33] and RB is\n\nreported that lost in ~40% of TNBC [34]  Furthermore  pRB level was found that lost in most\n\nTNBC by IHC analysis [35]  Studies have identified that luminal androgen receptor  LAR \n\nsubtype of TNBC cell lines might be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition [36  37]  Asghar et al  dem-\nonstrated that MFM223 and SUM185 cells were sensitive to palbociclib [37]  Indeed  these two\n\nLAR subtype cell lines harbored high level of pRB  The xenografts of LAR MDA-MB-453 cells\n\nwere significantly reduced by palbociclib treatment [37]  These findings supported AR positive\n\nand RB proficient TNBC were suitable for palbociclib treatment  In fact  a clinical trial of pal-\n\nbociclib in combination with bicalutamide  a non-steroidal AR inhibitor  for the treatment of\n\npatients with AR-positive TNBC is ongoing  ClinicalTrials gov Identifier  NCT02605486  In\n\nthe present study  palbociclib plus enzalutamide was found to effectively repress AR-positive/\n\nRB-proficient TNBC cell growth suggesting that co-expression of AR and RB might be a bio-\n\nmarker for combined treatment of palbociclib with enzalutamide in TNBC \n\nCurrent study has some limitation  first of all only four TNBC cell lines were used and there\n\nmight be other protein profile or mutants that can contribute to the differential effects of pal-\n\nbociclib and enzalutamide and combination in these cell lines  Furthermore  despite we\n\nshowed that knockdown RB attenuated palbociclib-mediated effect on AR+/RB+ MDA-MB-\n\n453 cells  the notion that combination effect of palbociclib and enzalutamide is most signifi-\n\ncant in AR+/RB+ MDA-MB-453 cells needs further mechanistic studies to validate that AR is\n\nessential for palbociclib-mediated cell cycle arrest in AR+/RB+ TNBC cells  Last but not the\n\nleast  our study is limited by lack of sufficient and consolidative clinical data to support the\n\npossible association between RB and AR  It is also not clear and inconclusive with regards to\n\nthe role of AR and RB expressions in TNBC tumors  More clinical studies are needed to\n\naddress or validate the biological association between AR and RB \n\nIn conclusion  we found that palbociclib effectively inhibited RB-proficient TNBC cell\n\ngrowth and the expression of AR might contribute for palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest  More-\n\nover  enzalutamide enhanced the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-pro-\n\nficient TNBC cells indicating that palbociclib in combination with enzalutamide may be a\n\ntherapeutic strategy for AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBCs \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  The relationships between AR gene expression and clinical variables  The level 3\ndata of mRNA RSEM

systems are designed to assist radiologists for\nmammography interpretation  CADe is employed to discover abnormal structures within the\nmammogram while CADx is used to determine the signiﬁcance of the discovered abnormality  Despite\npromising results  current CADe systems are limited by high false-positive rates1  and CADx systems for\nmammography are not yet approved for clinical use2  Although the technical difﬁculty of CAD in\nmammography has been substantial  there is another obstacle that must be addressed to enable this\nresearch  decision support system evaluation \n\nOur review of the CAD literature reveals inconsistent data sources and data-set sizes  In addition  only\nfew of the published results can be reproduced directly  as most evaluation data are not public  Tables 1\nand 2 contain a sample of many systems  CADe and CADx  respectively  that have been evaluated using\nprivate data sets or undeﬁned portions of public data sets  Without common data sets  it is impossible to\nrigorously compare methods  This is hindering CAD research in mammography  We seek to address this\nchallenge by providing a standard data set for evaluation \n\nThe non-medical computer vision community has adopted an open research approach  This includes\nprovision of standard data sets for evaluation of algorithms  For example  ImageNet is a database of\n14 197 122 images from 27 ‘high-level’ categories including animals  food  and vehicles  Each category has\nat least 51 sub-categories  allowing for highly speciﬁc classiﬁcations3  Other public databases include\nMixed National Institute of Standards and Technology  MNIST  database  a database of hand-written\ndigits4  and Caltech 256  a database of 265 object categories such as helicopters  planes  motorbikes  and\nschool buses5  These data sets and others like them have provided a benchmark for computer vision\nresearch  Many researchers point to the existence of these open data sets as the primary drivers for recent\nsuccesses in image classiﬁcation technologies  such as deep learning \n\nConversely  few well-curated public data sets have been provided for the mammography community \nThese include the Digital Database for Screening Mammography  DDSM 6  the Mammographic Imaging\nAnalysis Society  MIAS  database7  and the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications  IRMA  project8 \nAlthough these public data sets are useful  they are limited in terms of data set size and accessibility  For\nexample  most researchers using the DDSM do not leverage all its images for a variety of historical\nreasons  When the database was released in 1997  computational resources to process hundreds or\nthousands of images were not widely available  Additionally  the DDSM images are saved in non-\nstandard compression ﬁles that require the use of decompression code that has not been updated or\nmaintained for modern computers  Finally  the region-of-interest  ROI  annotations for the\nabnormalities in the DDSM were provided to indicate a general position of lesions  but not a precise\nsegmentation for them  Therefore  many researchers must implement segmentation algorithms for\naccurate feature extraction \n\nWhile there are substantial challenges in using the DDSM for method evaluation  due to its size and\nother unique characteristics  we believe that it can still be a powerful resource for imaging research  The\nDDSM is a database of 2 620 scanned ﬁlm mammography studies  It contains normal  benign  and\nmalignant cases with veriﬁed pathology information  The scale of the database along with ground truth\nvalidation makes the DDSM a useful tool in the development and testing of decision support systems\ndespite the fact that the images are scanned ﬁlm instead of full ﬁeld digital mammograms  This is because\nthere is currently no mammography database of this size publicly available  We report here the\ndevelopment of  and propose to release  the CBIS-DDSM  Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM  an\nupdated version of the DDSM providing easily accessible data and improved ROI segmentation  This\nresource will contribute to the advancement of decision support system research in mammography \nsupplying a standardized mammography data \n\nPerformance statistics of selected CADe methods for the detection of abnormalities\n\nAuthors Size of Data set  Cases

already contains a large amount of information for each of its 2 620 cases  However  some\ninformation is limited  speciﬁcally the ROI annotations  while other information is difﬁcult to access  We\nhave solved these issues by updating the ROI segmentations and by gathering and reformatting the\nmetadata into a more accessible format  Figure 1 shows a diagram of the processes performed to prepare\nthe data set  image decompression and reannotation and metadata extraction and reformatting \n\nDescription of DDSM\nThe DDSM is a collection of mammograms from the following sources  Massachusetts General Hospital \nWake Forest University School of Medicine  Sacred Heart Hospital  and Washington University of\nSt Louis School of Medicine  The DDSM was developed through a grant from the DOD Breast Cancer\nResearch Program  US Army Research and Material Command  and the necessary patient consents were\nobtained by the original developers of the DDSM6  The cases are annotated with ROIs for calciﬁcations\nand masses  as well as the following information that may be useful for CADe and CADx algorithms \nBreast Imaging Reporting and Data System  BI-RADS  descriptors for mass shape  mass margin \ncalciﬁcation type  calciﬁcation distribution  and breast density  overall BI-RADS assessment from 0 to 5 \nrating of the subtlety of the abnormality from 1 to 5  and patient age \n\nParse semantic features\nDDSM provides metadata in the form of ics ﬁles  These ﬁles include the patient age  the date of the study \nas well as the date of digitization  the dense tissue category  the scanner used to digitize  and the\nresolution of each image  Additionally  those cases with abnormalities have OVERLAY ﬁles that contain\ninformation about each abnormality  including type of abnormality  mass or calciﬁcation  and the\n\nPerformance statistics of selected CADx methods for the classiﬁcation of masses\n\nAuthors Size of Data set  Cases  Public or Private Data Classiﬁcation

DOI  10 1038/sdata 2017 177 3\n\n\n\nBI-RADS descriptors mentioned above  These metadata have been extracted and compiled into a single\ncomma-separated values  CSV  ﬁle \n\nRemoval of questionable mass cases\nIt has been noted by other researchers that not all DDSM ROI annotations are accurate9  and we found\nthat some annotations indicate suspicious lesions that are not seen in the image  Due to this issue  we\nacquired the assistance of a trained mammographer who reviewed the questionable cases  In this process \nwe found 339 images in which a mass was not clearly seen  These images were removed from the ﬁnal\ndata set  Additionally  several cases were removed by TCIA due to personal health information in the\nimages \n\nImage decompression\nDDSM images are distributed as lossless joint photographic experts group  JPEG  ﬁles  LJPEG  an\nobsolete image format  The only library capable of decompressing these images is the Stanford PVRG-\nJPEG Codec v1 1  which was last updated in 1993  We modiﬁed the PVRG-JPEG codec to successfully\ncompile on an OSX 10 10 5  Yosemite  distribution using Apple GCC clang-602 0 53  The original\ndecompression code outputs data in 8-bit or 16-bit raw binary bitmaps6  We wrote python tools to read\nthis raw data and store it as 16-bit gray scale Tag Image File Format  TIFF  ﬁles  These ﬁles were later\nconverted to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine  DICOM  format  which is standard for\nmedical images  This process is entirely lossless and preserved all information from the original\nDDSM ﬁles \n\nImage processing\nThe original DDSM ﬁles were distributed with a set of bash and C tools for Linux to perform image\ncorrection and metadata processing  These tools were very difﬁcult to refactor for use on modern systems \nInstead  we re-implemented these tools in Python to be cross-platform and easy to understand for\nmodern users \n\nAll images in the DDSM were derived from several different scanners at different institutions  The\nDDSM data descriptions provide methods to convert raw pixel data into 64-bit optical density values \nwhich are standardized across all images  Optical density values were then re-mapped to 16-bit gray scale\nTIFF ﬁles and later converted to DICOM format for the data repository \n\nThe DDSM automatically clips optical density values to be between 0 05 and 3 0 for noise reduction \nWe perform this clipping as well  but provide a ﬂag to remove the clipping and retain the original optical\ndensity values \n\nImage cropping\nSeveral CAD tasks require only analyzing abnormalities  the portion of the image in the ROI  without\nneeding the full mammogram image  We provide a set of convenience images  which are focused crops of\nabnormalities  Abnormalities were cropped by determining the bounding rectangle of the abnormality\nwith respect to its ROI \n\nMass segmentation\nMass margin and shape have long been proven substantial indicators for diagnosis in mammography \nBecause of this  many methods are based on developing mathematical descriptions of the tumor outline \nDue to the dependence of these methods on accurate ROI segmentation and the imprecise nature of\nmany of the DDSM-provided annotations  as seen in Fig  2  we applied a lesion segmentation algorithm\n described below  that is initialized by the general original DDSM contours but is able to supply much\nmore accurate ROIs  Figure 2 contains example ROIs from the DDSM  our mammographer  and the\nautomated segmentation algorithm  As shown  the DDSM outlines provide only a general location and\nnot a precise mass boundary  The segmentation algorithm was designed to provide exact delineation of\nthe mass from the surrounding tissue  This segmentation was done only for masses and not calciﬁcations \n\nLesion segmentation was accomplished by applying a modiﬁcation to the local level set framework as\npresented in Chan and Vese10–12  Level set models follow a non-parametric deformable model  thus can\nhandle topological changes during evolution  Chan-Vese model is a region-based method that estimates\nspatial statistics of image regions and ﬁnds a minimal energy where the model best ﬁts the image \nresulting in convergence of the contour towards the desired object  Our modiﬁcation of the local\nframework includes automated evaluation of the local region surrounding each contour point  For low\ncontrast lesions  small local region is determined  and excessive curve evolution is thus prevented  On the\nother hand  for noisy or heterogeneous lesions  a relatively large local region is assigned to the contour\npoint to prevent convergence of the level set contour into local minima  Local frameworks require an\ninitialization of the contour  and thus in our case the original DDSM annotation was used as the level set\nsegmentation initialization \n\nStandardized train/test splits\nSeparate sets of cases for training and testing algorithms are important for ensuring that all researchers\nare using the same cases for these tasks  Speciﬁcally  the test set should contain cases of varying difﬁculty\n\nwww nature com/sdata/\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 4 170177 | DOI  10 1038/sdata 2017 177 4\n\n\n\nin order to ensure that the method is tested thoroughly  The data were split into a training set and a\ntesting set based on the BI-RADS category  This allows for an appropriate stratiﬁcation for researchers\nworking on CADe as well as CADx  Note that many of the BI-RADS assessments likely were updated\nafter additional information was gathered by the physician  as it is unconventional to subscribe BI-RADS\n4 and 5 to screening images  The split was obtained using 20% of the cases for testing and the rest for\ntraining  The data were split for all mass cases and all calciﬁcation cases separately  Here ‘case’ is used to\nindicate a particular abnormality  seen on the craniocaudal  CC  and/or mediolateral oblique  MLO \nviews  which are the standard views for screening mammography  Figure 3 displays the histograms of\nBI-RADS assessment and pathology for the training and test sets for calciﬁcation cases and mass cases  As\nshown  the data split was performed in such a way to provide equal level of difﬁculty in the training and\ntest sets  Table 3 contains the number of benign and malignant cases for each set \n\nCode availability\nThe code used to generate these data sets from a raw dump of the DDSM was written in Python v2 7 9 \nIt is publicly available as a git repository on GitHub at github com/fjeg/ddsm_tools \n\nData Records\nThe images are distributed at the full mammography and abnormality level as DICOM ﬁles  Full\nmammography images include both MLO and CC views of the mammograms \n\nAbnormalities are represented as binary mask images of the same size as their associated\nmammograms  These mask images delineate the ROI of each abnormality  Users can perform an\nelement-wise selection of pixels within an abnormality mask that was created for each mammogram  For\nconvenience of abnormality analysis  we have also distributed images containing just the abnormalities\ncropped by the bounding box of their ROI  Abnormality ﬁles have been separated into Java Network\n\nFigure 2  Example ROI outlines from each of the four BI-RADS density categories  The Dice’s coefﬁcients\n\nare provided for each

format  speciﬁcally as decompressed\nimages and updated metadata extraction code  as well as by providing improved ROI segmentation and\ntraining and testing splits for evaluation  The methods for the validation of the ROI segmentation are\ngiven below \n\nSegmentation evaluation\nIdeally  we would provide hand-drawn segmentations for each mass lesion in CBIS-DDSM  However  this\nwould be a prohibitively large task to accomplish  We thus used an automated segmentation algorithm\nwith the goal of providing better segmentations than those available in the DDSM  Since the\nsegmentations we provide for the mass lesions in CBIS-DDSM were generated by our automated\nalgorithm  we evaluated the segmentations in CBIS-DDSM by comparing ROIs from 118 images in CBIS-\nDDSM with hand-drawn outlines that were provided by an experienced radiologist  We computed the\n\nBenign Cases Malignant Cases\n\nCalciﬁcation Training Set 329 cases  552 abnormalities  273 cases  304 abnormalities \n\nCalciﬁcation Test Set 85 cases  112 abnormalities  66 cases  77 abnormalities \n\nMass Training Set 355 cases  387 abnormalities  336 cases  361 abnormalities \n\nMass Test Set 117 cases  135

original DDSM annotations and the newly hand-drawn annotations  DH D  The\nDice coefﬁcient is a common metric for validity of image segmentation  Additionally  we use the\nWilcoxon signed rank test to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of DH C as compared to DH D  We\nutilized this test instead of a standard t-test due to the non-normal distributions of Dice coefﬁcients  as\nseen in Fig  4  Finally  we examined the histogram and statistics of the difference between DH C and DH D \n\nThe average DH C was 0 792± 0 108  and the average DH D was 0 398± 0 195  Figure 4 shows the\nhistogram of DH C and DH D for each of the 118 new hand-drawn images  The histogram shows that the\nmajority of the images were automatically segmented with high correlation to the hand-drawn ROIs \nThe Wilcoxon

the computer method decreases\nwith increase in breast density  Though DH C and DH D are comparable in some cases  particularly in\nhigher density cases  the computer-generated ROIs were in much higher agreement with the hand-drawn\nROIs and are overall much better segmentations \n\nReferences\n1  Nishikawa  R  M  & Gur  D  CADe for early detection of breast cancer-current status and why we

heterogeneous disease featuring several different phenotypes\nwith consistently different biological characteristics  Neuroligins are neural cell adhesion\nmolecules that have been implicated in heterotopic cell adhesion  In humans  alterations in\nneuroligin genes are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases  Until recently  neuro-\nligins have been shown to be abundantly expressed in blood vessels and also play a role\nimplicated in the growth of glioma cells  Here we report increased expression of neuroligin\n4X  NLGN4X  in breast cancer  We found NLGN4X was abundantly expressed in breast\ncancer tissues  NLGN4X expression data for all breast cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell\nLine Encyclopedia  CCLE  was analyzed  Correlation between NLGN4X levels and clinico-\npathologic parameters were analyzed within Oncomine datasets  Evaluation of these bioin-\nfomatic datasets results revealed that NLGN4X expression was higher in triple negative\nbreast cancer cells  particularly the basal subtype and tissues versus non-triple-negative\nsets  Its level was also observed to be higher in metastatic tissues  RT-PCR  flow cytometry\nand immunofluorescence study of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells validated\nthat NLGN4X was increased in MDA-MB-231  Knockdown of NLGN4X expression by\nsiRNA decreased cell proliferation and migration significantly in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer\ncells  NLGN4X knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in induction of apoptosis as deter-\nmined by annexin staining  elevated caspase 3/7 and cleaved PARP by flow cytometry \nHigh NLGN4X expression highly correlated with decrease in relapse free-survival in TNBC \nNLGN4X might represent novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast

with this cancer remains 2 to 3\n\nyears [1]  Clinical management and treatment outcome in patients with breast cancer may\n\nvary due to its high heterogeneity at the histopathologic and molecular levels [2] as evident by\n\nclinicopathological characteristics and molecular markers  Breast cancer is a heterogeneous\n\ndisease that has been classified into five major biologically distinct intrinsic subtypes  luminal\n\nA  luminal B  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2  HER2  overexpressing  basal-like \n\nand normal-like [3]  Despite advances in early detection and understanding of the molecular\n\nbasis of breast cancer biology  about 40% of the patients with early-stage breast cancer have\n\nrecurrent and metastatic disease [4]  Improving our understanding of the molecular mecha-\n\nnisms of the metastatic process might also improve clinical management of the disease  Tumor\n\nmetastasis consists of a complex series of events including cell migration  invasion  adhesion\n\nand blood vessel formation  Initiation of metastasis requires invasion  which is enabled by epi-\n\nthelial to mesenchymal transition of cancer cells  The process of tissue invasion and metastasis\n\ninvolves a series of attachment and detachment events based on cell or substrate attachment [5] \n\nOne crucial step during tumor invasion is loss of cancer cells adhesiveness to the extracellular\n\nmatrix component of basement membrane and mesenchymal tissue  It is believed that these\n\ninvasive cells have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition  EMT  which is associ-\n\nated with increased expression of cell-adhesion molecules such as laminin  α6β4 integrins  and\nCD44 [6]  Cell junctions like adherens  septates and tight junctions play an important role in the\n\ncontrol of cell proliferation  intercellular barrier formation  cellular differentiation  survival  apo-\n\nptosis and angiogenesis [7]  Cell-adhesion molecules such as ICAM  CD146  and the glycopro-\n\ntein NMB play an important role in mediating metastasis [8–10]  Neuroligins constitute a family\n\nof neuronal transmembrane synaptic proteins whose structural and biochemical characteristics\n\nare indicative of a role in heterotypic cell adhesion [11  12]  The neuroligin  NLGN  gene family\n\nconsists of five members  NLGN1 at 3q26  NLGN2 at 17p13  NLGN3 at Xq13  NLGN4 at Xp22 \n\nand NLGN4Y at Yq11  [13]  Their large extracellular N-terminal domain is homologous to ser-\n\nine esterases  They are of great importance in mediating synapse formation in the central ner-\n\nvous system  and they interact with neurexins from the opposite side  in trans  of the synaptic\n\ncleft in a calcium-dependent manner [14]  Both proteins display a strong and selective synapse\n\nformation which promotes activity between neurons in vitro  When expressed in non-neuronal\ncells  they mediate synaptogenesis between the cells and the adjacent neurons [15  16]  Besides\n\nbeing neuronal proteins  neuroligins have been implicated in vascular remodeling during angio-\n\ngenesis [17]  Recent studies have shown a mitogenic effect of NLGN3 in glioma proliferation\n\nand progression [18]  Recent studies highlight the role of NLGN1 in stabilizing laminin interac-\n\ntion with integrins suggests the importance of this molecule in mediating cell adhesion  Other\n\nstudies have shown that NLGN1 is overexpressed in a metastatic model of prostate cancer and is\n\nresponsible for cell adhesion [19]  Our previous studies using a selection from a combinatorial\n\nrandom peptide library against breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines identified several peptides\n\n[20] mimicking neuroligin  NLGN-1  3 and NLGN4X  In this study  we sought to determine\n\nthe expression of NLGN4X  its relevance and functional significance in breast cancer \n\nMaterials and methods\nCell lines and culture conditions\nAll cell lines were obtained from

cells play an important role in the develop-\n\nment and progression of cancer  Cell adhesion molecules provide a mechanistic role in the\n\nprocess of cancer metastasis and invasion [25  26]  The metastatic event involves a series of\n\nconsecutive attachment and detachment events that are based on cell-to-cell and cell-to-sub-\n\nstrate interactions  Invasive tumor cells’ ability to reach the blood  lymph nodes  and distant\n\norgans depends highly on the adhesive interaction with the basement membrane and extracel-\n\nlular matrix of the target host organ  Several cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM 1  laminin\n\nand fibronectin have been associated with the invasive process  growth  and metastasis of\n\nbreast tumors  [27]  This is the first study to link the expression of neuronal cell adhesion mol-\n\necules  neuroligins  to breast cancer  Here we show that the expression of NLGN4X is signifi-\n\ncantly higher in several subset of breast cancer  according to the CCLE database  This was\n\nfurther confirmed with flow cytometry analysis on the two selected cell types that are represen-\n\ntative of different breast cancer cell subtypes and that express a range of NLGN4X  MCF-7\n\n ER+/PR+/HER2−/low NLGN4X  and MDAMB231  ER−/PR−/HER-/very high NLGN4X \nImmunofluorescence confocal microscopy of MDA-MB-231 cells with anti-NLGN4X anti-\n\nbody again confirmed the presence of NLGN4X  The bioinformatics Oncomine TGCA data\n\nrevealed that NLGN4X expression was increased in metastatic tissue  It is possible that\n\nNLGN4X can modulate the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells  and possibly play a role\n\nin the ability of cancer cells to metastasize to distant sites  These observations are supported by\n\nthe fact that NLGN4X expression predicts relapse-free breast cancer survival outcomes in\n\nFig 8  Effect of NLGN4X on cell migration and proliferation  A  Quantification of area migrated in NLGN4X knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells compared with\nscrambled

in\n\nbreast carcinoma and lymph node metastasis  30 out of 40 and 6 out of 10 breast cancer tissues\n\nand lymph node metastasis  respectively were positive for NLGN4X  We did not find any dif-\n\nference in staining of NLGN4X in ER+  PR+ vs ER-  PR- breast cancer tissues \n\nNLGN4X protein and mRNA was effectively down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells after\n\nsiRNA transfection  The NLGN4X siRNA-transduced cells showed inhibition in cell prolifera-\n\ntion and migration in MDA-MB-231  indicating the migration and proliferation of TNBC\n\ncells were regulated by NLGN4X expression  The decrease in proliferation was mediated by\n\ninduction of apoptosis by NLGN4X knockdown as evident by elevated levels of cleaved PARP\n\nand caspase 3/7 activity  The depletion of NLGN4X also resulted in an increase of cells in both\n\nthe early stages and late stages of apoptosis  These suggest the role of NLGN4X as being essen-\n\ntial for cancer cells survival \n\nBased on these data  it is a good possibility that and NLGN4X can be used as a biomarker\n\nfor breast cancer and for prediction of survival outcomes of patients with hormone positive \n\nHer+ subtype and ER-  basal subtype  To the best of our knowledge  this is the first study to\n\nevaluate the prognostic significance of neuroligins expression in breast cancer  Further\n\ndetailed studies are required to elucidate the mechanistic role of these adhesion proteins in\n\nbreast cancer progression and metastasis \n\nFig 9  Effect of NLGN4X knockdown on apoptosis and apoptotic markers  A  The fluorescence

a benign entity  its uncommon concurrence \nwith cancer may lead physicians to pursue unsolicited aggres-\nsive diagnostic and therapeutic measures  Hence  DLN should \nbe included in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy \nin malignancies \n\nCase Report\n\nA 56-year-old Hispanic female patient with past medical his-\ntory of stage III-B left breast invasive ductal carcinoma triple-\nnegative was diagnosed in 2010  She underwent modified \nradical mastectomy  axillary lymph node dissection  and neo-\nadjuvant TAC  docetaxel plus doxorubicin plus cyclophospha-\nmide  and radiation completed in 2010 \n\nReview of her medical history was significant for diabetes melli-\ntus type II  hypertension  dyslipidemia  normocytic anemia  and \nright brachiocephalic vein thrombosis managed with Coumadin \n\nIn 2016  the patient presented with diffuse lymphadenopa-\nthy involving bilateral axillary and inguinal lymph nodes  sus-\npicious for recurrence of malignancy  No fever  chills  or skin \nlesions were reported  Complete review of systems was not \ncontributory \n\nLab values were  hemoglobin  11 6 g/dL  Hct  36 2%  MCV  \n88 1 fL  WBC  4 85×103/µL  and PLt  219×103/µL  Vitals were  \nt  37 3°C  BP  128/72  P  97  RR  18 \n\nOn physical examination  generalized lymphadenopathy was \nnoted  which was more pronounced on the right axilla  No skin \nlesions or organomegaly were appreciated \n\nThe patient underwent multiple imaging modalities  Following \nthe initial presentation  a PET scan was performed  showing hy-\npermetabolic lymph nodes in the right axillary and subpectoral \n\nregion  worrisome for malignancy  a lateral right axillary lymph \nnode measured 1 4×1 1 cm with an SUVmax of 6 0  and a sub-\ncentimeter right interpectoral lymph node showed SUVmax of \n3 6  These lymph nodes were contralateral to the patient’s left \nbreast carcinoma  Subcentimeter mildly FDG-avid lymph nodes \nwere seen in the left axilla  A millimetric left axillary lymph node \nshowed SUVmax of 1 8  Mildly FDG-avid bilateral level IIA cer-\nvical lymph nodes were seen  the more prominent one on the \nright  showing SUVmax of 3 6 and measuring 7 mm in short axis \n\nMultiple hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen in the ret-\nroperitoneum  left paraaortic region  left common iliac chain  \nand left external iliac chain  A hypermetabolic node along \nthe posteromedial aspect of the left psoas muscle measured \n1 5 cm in diameter  with an SUVmax of 8 3  A left external ili-\nac lymph node measured 2 1×1 5 cm with an SUVmax of 5 2  \nThe pattern of nodal disease was very suggestive of lympho-\nma  which may be an incidental finding in this patient with a \nhistory of breast cancer \n\nInterestingly  diffuse mildly increased tracer uptake was seen \nthroughout the spleen  which may have been related to ex-\ntramedullary hematopoiesis secondary to anemia or lympho-\nmatous infiltration \n\nHence  a subsequent right axillary lymph node needle core bi-\nopsy was performed and revealed follicular and interfollicu-\nlar lymphoid hyperplasia  without malignancy  The lymphade-\nnopathy persisted  so a follow-up abdomen and pelvis CT scan \nwith contrast was done and showed slightly enlarged left com-\nmon iliac lymph nodes  Figure 1  with subcentimeter paraaor-\ntic lymph nodes  Figure 2 \n\nA PET scan done at 4-month interval revealed progression \nof lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm  with sta-\nble diffuse increased uptake in the spleen  which could repre-\nsent lymphoproliferative disorder  or an infectious or inflam-\nmatory process \n\nConcurrent left inguinal lymph node needle core biopsy dem-\nonstrated follicular and interfollicular hyperplasia  Figure 3  \nscattered pigmented macrophages  Figure 4  and rare eo-\nsinophils  suggestive of dermatopathic lymphadenitis with-\nout malignancy \n\nA scheduled screening right breast mammogram showed no \nevidence of right breast malignancy  with interval enlargement \nof intramammary lymph nodes in the upper outer quadrant re-\nlated to known lymphoproliferative process  with stable right \naxillary lymphadenopathy  Follow-up chest  abdomen  and pel-\nvis CT scans revealed minimal interval increase in size of left \naxillary lymph nodes  as well as stable mildly enlarged retro-\nperitoneal and left external iliac lymph nodes

interval \nresolution of the previously noted diffuse increased uptake of \ntracer by the spleen  A final right axillary lymph node needle \ncore biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of dermatopathic lymph-\nadenitis without malignancy  Spontaneous resolution of der-\nmatopathic lymphadenitis was achieved without any further \nintervention or treatment \n\nDiscussion\n\nDermatopathic lymphadenitis  also known as lipomelanotic re-\nticulosis  or Pautrier–Woringer disease  is a rare type of benign \nlymphatic hyperplasia associated with a variety of exfoliative \nor eczematoid type inflammatory erythrodermas  The axillary \n\nand inguinal regions are most commonly affected  although \noccasionally it can present in the head and neck as well [5] \n\nDLN is often seen in patients with skin diseases  especially \nmycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome  but has rarely been \ndescribed in the absence of clinical skin disease  DLN was \nfirst coined by Hurwitt et al  The relationship between lymph \nnode hyperplasia and cutaneous disease was first described \nby Wise et al  although it was later established by Pautrier \nand Woringer as lipomelanotic reticulosis [6 7] \n\nIn adults and children  there is a range of non-neoplastic  \nnon-infectious etiologies for lymphadenopathy  These in-\nclude reactive lymphoid hyperplasia  RLH  dermatopathic \nlymphadenitis  DLN  Rosai- Dorfman disease  Castleman dis-\nease  Kimura disease  Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease  and lymph-\nadenopathy associated with autoimmune and metabolic/\nstorage disease  Differentiating between these nodal enti-\nties and diagnosing DLN is mostly based on the lymph node \nbiopsy  FNA  [8] 18F-FDG PET/CT  as a sensitive and noninva-\nsive whole-body imaging technique  can also be used as a \nvaluable aid in the diagnostic workup [9]  In a review by Hu \net al  of F-FDG PET/CT characteristics in malignancies vs  be-\nnign lymphadenopathy  the SUV max  of malignant tumors \n 6 3±2 4  was significantly greater than that of benign lesions \n 2 9±2 0   P<0 001  Receiver-operating characteristic curve \nanalysis showed that the SUVmax cutoff value of 3 5 had a \n\nFigure 3   Lymph node with follicular

on fine-needle aspiration cytology include melanin-lad-\nen macrophages with variable pigment  large  histiocytic clus-\nters with blood vessels at the center  characteristic histiocytes \nwith elongated vesicular nuclei  nuclear grooves  crumpled and \nconvoluted nuclei  and pseudonucleoli  and absence of or very \nfew tingible body macrophages  Positivity on immunostaining \nfor S-100 and negativity for CD68 aid in the diagnosis [11] \n\nIn our case  distinguishing DLN and breast cancer lymph node \ninvolvement depended on multiple characteristics  PET scan \nfindings of higher SUVmax in malignancies compared to benign \nlymphadenopathy  and the tendency of breast cancer to metas-\ntasize to regional axillary lymph nodes in contrast to the ten-\ndency of DLN to have widespread involvement of lymph nodes \n\nReferences \n\n 1   Miranda RN  Khoury JD  Medeiros LJ  Dermatopathic \nLymphadenopathy  In  Atlas of Lymph Node Pathology  Miranda RN  Khoury \nJD  Medeiros LJ  eds

cancer recurrence  This should be taken into consideration \nwhen evaluating lymphadenopathy in patients with a cancer \nhistory  as this presentation may not always be due to infec-\ntion or malignancy  but can be due to a reactive condition such \nas DLN [6]  making the differential diagnosis of DLN an impor-\ntant entity to keep in mind  even in the absence of skin lesions \n\nThis case also suggests that extensive workup in an asymp-\ntomatic patient with initial negative findings for malignancy \nrecurrence is of low diagnostic yield due to the benign course \nand spontaneous resolution of this disease \n\nConflicts of interest\n\nNone \n\n 6  Srinivasamurthy BC  Saha K  Senapati S  Saha A  Fine needle aspiration cy-\ntology of dermatopathic lymphadenitis in an

However  potential myocardial\ninduced by these 2 types of drugs not only affect the\nis of patients  but also limit their applications in\n] Myocardial damages caused by chemotherapy drugs\ned into acute  subacute  tachycardias or bradycardias \nial effusion  and heart failure  Once it developed into\nve heart failure  mortality can reach as high as 48% [4 5]\n\ne  it is of great signiﬁcance to timely screening and early\n\nCurrent diagnostic methods of myocardial damage used in clinic\ninclude electrocardiograph  ECG  Doppler echocardiography \nbrain natriuretic peptide  cardiac troponin-T  and creatine\nkinase-MB fraction levels [6 7] Among these  ECG has the best\ncost performance and is most commonly used  For patients with\nacute or subacute myocardial damage which usually caused by\nedema of myocardial cells and myocardial cell vacuolar\ndegeneration  the ECG manifested with nonspeciﬁc ST-T  ST\nsegment-T wave  alternations  lowing and ﬂatting of QRS wave\n QRS complex  and prolongation of QT interval  However  for\npatients with chronic myocardial damage  the changes in ECG\nsigns are transient and not easy to be captured [8–10] A simple\nECG detection cannot instantly reﬂect the degree of myocardial\ndamage in patients after chemotherapy  and commonly used\nclinical cardiac markers are lack of enough sensitivity and\nspeciﬁcity for detection [6 8]\n\nIschemia-modiﬁed albumin  IMA  is produced by human\nserum albumin  HSA  which local structure changed when it\nﬂows through ischemic tissues  Local tissues can produce\noxidative stress reaction when myocardial ischemia occurred \nand the N-terminal amino acid sequence of albumin was\noxidatively modiﬁed  which result in IMA formation  IMA\nconcentration rapidly increased in 5 to 10 minutes postmyo-\ncardial ischemia in peripheral blood  and sustained increase\nduring the course of ischemia  it would lasted for 2 to 4 hours \nand returned to baseline level in 6 to 10 hours [11

amplified in human breast cancer  \nhuman squamous cell lung cancer  and several other cancer types [1–3]  This amplicon is \ngenerally focal in nature  but has several discreet regions that can be amplified \nindependently of each other [4]  Accordingly  it is likely that this genomic region harbors \nseveral driving oncogenes  with at least one in each sub-region  Indeed  there are numerous \nreports in the literature documenting the transforming potential of at least six different genes \nfrom this amplicon [5–14]  For several years  our laboratory has been interested in the role \nplayed by one of these candidate oncogenes  the histone methyl transferase  NSD3  formerly \nknown as WHSC1L1  and we have published evidence for its amplification and \noverexpression in the SUM-44 human breast cancer cell line  primary human breast cancers  \nand its transforming function when overexpressed in MCF-10A cells  More recently  we \ndemonstrated that NSD3 can drive high level expression of ERa and induce estrogen-\nindependent  but estrogen receptor-dependent proliferation and survival of SUM-44 breast \ncancer cells [2  4  15  16]  These findings are consistent with data obtained by other labs that \nhave identified NSD3 as one of several genes in the amplicon that are associated with a poor \noutcome in ERa-positive breast cancer [6  17–22]  NSD3 has also been shown to have \ntransforming ability in other model systems  and has been implicated as a driving oncogene \nby GISTIC analysis of large datasets derived from human breast cancer specimens [23]  \nThus  there is a significant body of literature supporting the notion that NSD3 is an \nimportant oncogene in breast and other cancers in which the 8p11 region is focally \namplified  However  because of the complexity of this genomic region  and because FGFR1 \nis a neighboring gene on the amplicon that is almost always co-amplified and overexpressed \nwith NSD3  the oncogenic role of NSD3 in human breast cancer has not yet been widely \naccepted [24]  To investigate further the potential of NSD3 to act as a breast cancer \noncogene  we developed a transgenic mouse model with targeted expression of NSD3 to the \nmammary epithelium  In this report  we demonstrate that NSD3 transgenic FVB mice \nexhibit altered mammary gland morphology during development  differentiation  and \ninvolution  resulting in a profound lactation defect caused by the failure of the alveoli to \nundergo full functional differentiation  By 40 weeks of age  many of these mice developed \nmammary gland hyperplasias  dysplasias  carcinoma in situ  and mammary carcinomas  \nThus  these results extend our in vitro results and show that targeted expression of NSD3 to \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page

methods\nChemicals and antibodies\n\nAll reagents used for carmine staining of whole mounts  including ethanol  xylene  and \nglacial acetic acid  were purchased from Fisher Scientific  Hampton  NH  unless stated \notherwise  The NSD3 antibody used for western blotting and immunostaining was \npurchased from ProteinTech Group Inc   Cat  No  11345-1-AP  and the ERa antibody was \npurchased from Santa Cruz  Cat  No  sc-7207  Primers used for genotyping were purchased \nfrom IDT \n\nTransgenic mice\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee  IACUC  at the Medical University of SC \n MUSC  approved all animal experiments  AR#3397  For the purposes of this study  \nFVB/N mice were used to generate NSD3 and KAT6A transgenic mouse colonies  The \ninbred FVB/N strain is commonly used for the production of transgenic mice  as they \nproduce large litters and their large pronuclei can withstand microinjection of the transgene  \nMale and female WT FVB/N mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories  Bar Harbor  \nME  and bred under typical conditions with unlimited access to food and water  Targeted \nexpression of NSD3 and KAT6A to the mammary gland was achieved by cloning each \ntransgene into the MKbpAII vector with an MMTV promoter  Cloning and preparation of \nNSD3 and KAT6A constructs as well as generation of transgenic mice was performed by the \nGene Function Core at MUSC following the standard protocol for production of transgenic \nmice \n\nNSD3 and KAT6A genotyping\nTo identify positive transgenic pups  tail snips were obtained from 3 week-old pups before \nweaning  Tails were incubated overnight at 55 °C in digestion buffer and DNA was purified \nusing the ZR Genomic DNA™ Mini Prep Kit  Zymo Research  Irvine  CA  Genotyping by \nPCR was performed with the following primers  NSD3 For  5′-\nATACTCTGAGTCCAAACCGGG-3′ and NSD3 Rev  5′-GTGTGAGCGCTCTTCAG-3′  \nKAT6A For  5′-GGGGCAAAGTTTGGGTG-3′ and KAT6A Rev  5′-\nCAGGATGGATGGCCACTGTT-3′  PCR

 Virgin mammary glands were \nharvested at 12 weeks of age and mammary glands of females at mid-pregnancy were \nharvested between day 12 and 14 post-mating  Lactating mammary glands were taken 7–10 \ndays following the birth of litters  and at least 2 weeks were allowed for involution to occur \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 3\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 May

spread on microscope \nslides  Polysine pre-cleaned microscope slides  Thermo Scientific  MA  and prepared for \ncarmine staining  Briefly  once the glands adhered to the slide  approximately 1–2 min  they \nwere fixed in 100% ethanol/30% acetic acid  3 1  at room temperature overnight  The \nfollowing day  slides were washed in 70% ethanol for 15 min  then in distilled water for 5 \nmin  The glands were then stained overnight with carmine alum [1 g Carmine  Sigma-\nAldrich C-6125  2 5 g Aluminum potassium sulfate  Sigma-Aldrich C-237 086  in 500 ml \nwater]  The tissues were then washed in 75  95  and 100% ethanol for 15 min each and \ncleared in xylene overnight  For long-term storage  whole mounts were stored in methyl \nsalicylate  Sigma-Aldrich  St  Louis  MO  Tumors harvested from NSD3 transgenic females \nwere cleanly excised and fixed in formalin overnight \n\nTissue processing and staining\nWhole mounts and tumors were processed by the Biorepository and Tissue Analysis

biotinylated secondary \nantibody  Vector  CA  USA  for 30 min and ABC reagent  Vector  CA USA  for 30 min  \nImmunocomplexes were visualized by DAB  Dako  Glostrup  Denmark  reaction and \nsections were counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting \n\nResults\nDelayed development in pups from NSD3 transgenic female mice\n\nTo further our studies on the oncogenic role of the breast cancer candidate oncogene NSD3  \nwe generated a transgenic mouse line in which NSD3 expression was targeted to the \nmammary gland  To identify potentially positive transgenic pups  tail biopsies were taken \nfrom 2 week-old mice and PCR was performed to detect the transgene  thereby identifying \nfounder  F0  mice  Once founder mice were of breeding age  both male and female F0 mice \nwere mated with wild-type  WT  FVB/N mice to establish F1 offspring \n\nThe first goal of these experiments was to determine if targeted expression of NSD3 in the \nmammary gland would have observable effects on mammary gland biology through the \nnormal growth  differentiation  and involution cycle of the mouse mammary gland  Early on \nin our observations  we noticed that pups born to NSD3 transgenic female mice were \nunderdeveloped  By contrast  pups born to WT females mated with NSD3 transgenic males \ndid not display any developmental defects  Fig  1  This was readily apparent at day 9  at \nwhich point pups nursed by NSD3 transgenic females were not only significantly smaller \nthan pups born to wild-type mothers  but also showed delayed hair growth and eye opening \ncompared to pups nursed by WT females  However  pups born to WT females mated with \nNSD3 transgenic males and nursed by WT females did not display this developmental lag  \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 4\n\nBreast Cancer Res

developmental lag displayed in pups nursed by NSD3 transgenic females was \nevident in both WT and NSD3 transgenic pups  giving the first indication that this \ndevelopmental delay was due to a lactation defect present in the NSD3 transgenic females \nand not a result of NSD3 expression in the pups \n\nLactation deficiency in NSD3 transgenic females\nTo further investigate the influence of mammary gland-targeted expression of NSD3 on \nmammary gland biology  mammary glands from virgin  mid-pregnant  lactating  and post-\nlactating mice were harvested for whole mount and histologic analysis  As seen in Fig  2a  \nmammary glands from 12 week-old virgin transgenic females displayed increased ductal \nbranching and terminal bud formation compared to WT female virgins  Additionally  \nmammary glands taken from NSD3 transgenic females mid-pregnancy  12–14 days  Fig  2b  \nshowed more numerous and densely packed alveolar buds compared to WT females during \npregnancy  Although these phenotypes were subtle  blind scoring of these mammary gland \nwhole mounts identified mammary glands from transgenic mice 100% of the time  The \nphenotypic differences between mammary glands from lactating transgenic females versus \nwild-type mice were not subtle and were consistent with the lactation defect hypothesized \nbased on the growth of the pups as described above  Mammary glands from lactating \ntransgenic mice showed evidence of gross defects in the full functional differentiation of \nmany of the alveoli in these mammary glands  Fig  2c  This failure to achieve full \nfunctional differentiation was observed in every lactation-state mammary gland we observed \nin transgenic females  and is consistent with the growth retardation observed in the pups of \nthese mice  In addition  examination of post-lactation mammary glands from wild-type and \ntransgenic mice showed that while post-lactation mammary glands from WT female mice \nhad undergone involution  glands from transgenic females failed to completely involute and \nshowed evidence of hyperplasia  Fig  2d \n\nMammary hyperplasia  dysplasia  and tumorigenesis in NSD3 transgenic females\nTo examine the long-term effects of mammary gland-targeted expression of NSD3  a group \nof 25 transgenic and wild-type females were maintained until they reached one year of age \nand monitored weekly for tumor development  We first palpated mammary tumors in two \ntransgenic mice at 40 weeks of age  and thereafter  several additional transgenic parous \nfemales developed mammary tumors at ages between 40 and 50 weeks  Overall  five of the \n25 transgenic mice  all of which were parous females  developed mammary tumors  By \ncontrast  none of the WT mice developed tumors or any other morphologic abnormalities  \nOnce tumors reached a size of 1 cm3  the mice were euthanized and the tumors were excised \nand fixed in formalin for histological analysis  At the same time  the remaining mammary \nglands were harvested from tumor-bearing females and whole mounts were prepared  \nInterestingly  mammary glands from tumor-bearing mice exhibited numerous ductal and \nalveolar hyperplasias and ductal dysplasias  Fig  3  Histological analysis of these mammary \nlesions revealed a wide variety of abnormalities including areas that would be identified as \nproliferative and non-proliferative fibrocystic disease in humans  such as alveolar and ductal \nhyperplasia  adenosis  microcyst formation  and columnar cell change  Papillary lesions \nwere also identified  In addition  areas of epithelial atypia  dysplasia  and ductal carcinoma \nin situ  DCIS  were commonly observed  Patterns of DCIS were similar to those seen in \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 5\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat

identifiable micropapillary  cribriform  and clinging-type carcinoma  Patterns \nof invasive carcinoma markedly resembled that seen in high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma \nin humans with often solid or trabecular type growth patterns that exhibit a high mitotic rate \nand increasing degrees of necrosis as the tumors increased in size  No lesions or tumors were \nobserved in mammary glands of age-matched wild-type female mice  consistent with \npublished reports on the background incidence of mammary tumors in FVB mice  A total of \nfive of the 25 transgenic mice followed to 50 weeks of age developed frank mammary \ntumors  All of these mice also exhibited areas of mammary hyperplasia  dysplasia  and \ncarcinoma in situ in other mammary glands  In addition  three mice that did not develop \npalpable tumors during this time exhibited mammary hyperplasias and dysplasias  In all  95 \nmammary glands from the 25 mice were examined  with structural abnormalities identified \nin 18 of the 95 whole mounts  Fig  4 \n\nIt is noteworthy that in the course of these studies  we also generated KATA6A  Myst3  \ntransgenic mice  as we have previously implicated this gene from the 8p11-p12 region as a \nbreast cancer oncogene [14]  In contrast to the results obtained with the NSD3 transgenic \nmice  KATA6 mice did not exhibit any altered morphologic phenotypes or lactation defects  \nand never developed mammary pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions \n\nTo confirm transgene overexpression in the mammary glands of transgenic mice-bearing \ntumors or hyperplasias/dysplasias  immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the \nhistological sections from these mammary glands  Figure 5a shows that indeed  these \nmammary gland lesions and tumors stained positively for NSD3  as well as ERa  consistent \nwith our recently published association between NSD3 and ER expression in human breast \ncancer cell lines [16]  Finally  when tumors were harvested from transgenic female mice  \npieces of the tumor were subjected to enzymatic dissociation and plated into primary \nculture  After one to two weeks in culture  cells were harvested and assessed for expression \nof NSD3 by western blot analysis  Figure 5b confirms that these mouse mammary tumor \ncells express high levels of NSD3 protein \n\nIn summary  these studies demonstrate the oncogenic potential of NSD3 when expression is \ntargeted to the mammary gland of FVB mice and support the hypothesis that NSD3 is a \ndriving breast cancer oncogene from the 8p11 amplicon \n\nDiscussion\n8p11-p12 amplification is associated with poor survival and distant recurrence in luminal \nbreast cancer [1  3  4  17]  We and others have shown that overexpression of several genes \nwithin the 8p11-p12 region can provide a pathological gain-of-function to breast cells [15  \n16  22]  Within focal regions of gene amplification  it is often difficult to determine which \ngenes are most important and act as driving genes  Driving genes provide a necessary \ngrowth advantage that is essential for tumor survival  whereas while passenger genes are \noften amplified with driving genes  they are not necessary for proliferation or survival  \nPrevious published data are consistent with the notion that the 8p11-p12 amplicon contains \nboth driver and passenger genes  and studies from other laboratories have proposed different \ndrivers [2  4  15  25  26]  Predictions based on Cancer Genome Atlas data  including GISTIC \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 6\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat  Author manuscript  available

putative 8p11 amplicon driving genes  and \nhave identified NSD3 as a driving gene in multiple tumor types  including breast cancer \n[23]  In the present study  we demonstrated that targeted expression of NSD3 in the \nmammary epithelium of FVB mice resulted in drastic morphological alterations in the \nmammary gland  inhibited functional differentiation  and resulted in the development of \nhyperplasias  dysplasias  carcinoma in situ  and mammary carcinoma development \n\nWe first observed that targeted expression of NSD3 to the mammary epithelium blocked \nfunctional differentiation of the alveolar units in the mammary gland resulting in stunted \ndevelopmental growth of the offspring when compared to pups born to WT females  The \ndevelopmental lag was evident by postpartum day 9  pups nursed by NSD3 females had \ndelayed hair growth compared to pups nursed by WT females  This phenotype persisted \nthrough weaning age  resulting in significantly smaller NSD3 transgenic female-nursed \npups  In contrast  pups nursed by WT females displayed normal developmental patterns  \nInterestingly  the developmental lag was evident in all pups nursed by NSD3 transgenic \nfemales regardless of the genotype of the pups  Indeed  carmine staining of mammary glands \nfrom lactating NSD3 transgenic females showed areas where alveoli had failed to undergo \nfull functional differentiation \n\nIn addition to the lactation deficiency seen in NSD3 females  these mice developed \nmammary gland hyperplasias  dysplasias  and carcinomas  Tumors from NSD3 transgenic \nfemales presented as infiltrating ductal carcinomas with high nuclear grade  These tumors \nwere not well circumscribed and displayed irregular borders  The phenotypes of these mouse \nmammary carcinomas are significant because they are similar to the phenotypic \ncharacteristics observed in human breast cancers  Furthermore  the majority of glands in \ntumor-bearing NSD3 transgenic females showed areas of hyperplasia  dysplasia  and \ncarcinoma in situ \n\nConclusions\nPrevious studies from our lab and others have demonstrated the potent transforming \nproperties of NSD3  which is consistent with its role as an important driving oncogene on \nthe 8p11-p12 amplicon [15  16  22]  Here  we provide direct evidence for NSD3 as a breast \ncancer oncogene by showing that targeted expression of NSD3 in the mouse mammary \ngland prevents alveolar differentiation and results in development of pre-malignant lesions \nand mammary gland ductal carcinomas  At the present time  the only clinical studies that \nhave been performed in patients exhibiting the 8p11 amplicon have focused on targeting the \nFGFR1 gene  which is present on the amplicon and is often co-amplified with NSD3  The \nresults of these clinical studies have been disappointing in both breast and lung cancer \npatients bearing the amplicon [27  28]  These clinical findings suggest that FGFR1 is not a \nmajor driving oncogene in 8p11 amplified breast and lung cancers  Thus  it is now important \nto consider NSD3 as an important driving oncogene and a potential druggable target in \nbreast cancer patients  and perhaps lung cancer patients  bearing the 8p11 amplicon and \nexhibiting amplification and overexpression of NSD3 \n\nTurner-Ivey et al  Page 7\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat  Author

BRCA2  gene mutations can identify \nwomen at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer  These testing results can be used to select preventive interventions and guide \ntreatment  Differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive \ninterventions after testing have not previously been examined  \nPeriod Covered  2009–2014 \nDescription of System  Medical claims data from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters \ndatabases were used to estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA testing among women \naged 18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States  \nboth nationally and regionally \nResults  From 2009 to 2014  BRCA testing rates per 100 000 women aged 18–64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance \nincreased 2 3 times  102 7 to 237 8  in metropolitan areas and 3 0 times  64 8 to 191 3  in nonmetropolitan areas  The relative \ndifference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37% in 2009  102 7 versus 64 8  \nto 20% in 2014  237 8 versus 191 3  The relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan \nareas decreased more over time in younger women than in older women and decreased in all regions except the West  Receipt of \npreventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service  \nthe percentage of women who received a mastectomy was similar  the percentage of women who received magnetic resonance \nimaging of the breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas  as low as 5 8% in 2014 to as high as 8 2% in 2011  than metropolitan \nareas  as low as 7 3% in 2014 to as high as 10 3% in 2011  and the percentage of women who received mammography was lower \nin nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was similar in later years \n\nInterpretation  Possible explanations for the 47% decrease \nin the relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the \nstudy period include increased access to genetic services in \nnonmetropolitan areas and increased demand nationally as \na result of publicity  The relative differences in metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were smaller among \nwomen at younger ages compared with older ages \n\nCorresponding author  Katherine Kolor  Office of Public Health \nGenomics  Division of Public Health Information Dissemination

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPublic Health Action  Improved data sources and surveillance tools are needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA testing in \nthe United States  monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for BRCA testing  and assess receipt of preventive interventions \nfor women with BRCA mutations  Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic disparities in receipt of BRCA testing \nwhile simultaneously educating the public and health care providers about U S  Preventive Services Task Force recommendations \nand other clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and counseling \n\nIntroduction\nGenetic mutations in the breast cancer 1  BRCA1  and \n\nbreast cancer 2  BRCA2  genes can increase breast cancer risk \nin women by age 70 years from 7% to an estimated 45%–65% \nand can increase ovarian cancer risk by age 70 years from 0 6% \nto 17%–39%  1 2  Genetic testing based on personal and \nfamily health history criteria can identify women with BRCA \nmutations who could benefit from preventive interventions \nthat can decrease cancer risk  BRCA testing for women who \nhave received these cancer diagnoses can be used to make \nsurgical and drug treatment decisions  3 4   \n\nInterventions for women with BRCA mutations for cancer \nprevention and earlier detection include enhanced screening \n e g  receiving mammograms at a younger age and more \nfrequently than lower risk women along with magnetic \nresonance imaging [MRI]  risk-reducing medications such \nas tamoxifen or raloxifene  and prophylactic surgery to \nremove the breasts  ovaries  or both  Prophylactic mastectomy \ncan reduce the risk for breast cancer by 85%–100%  and \nprophylactic oophorectomy can reduce the risk for ovarian \ncancer by 69%–100% and breast cancer by 37%–100%  1  \nFor women who have breast cancer  prophylactic contralateral \nmastectomy might be offered as an option to reduce the risk for \ncontralateral breast cancers  5  BRCA testing is approved by \nthe Food and Drug Administration as a companion diagnostic \ntool to guide treatment with poly ADP-ribose  polymerase \n PARP  inhibitors among women with ovarian cancer who \nhave already undergone multiple lines of chemotherapy  6 7  \nPhase III clinical trials have reported promising results for the \nPARP inhibitor olaparib as a treatment for breast cancer in \nwomen with BRCA mutations  8  \n\nSeveral clinical guidelines are available to help specialty and \nprimary care providers to determine whether BRCA genetic \ncounseling and testing is appropriate for their patients  \nThe 2013 U S  Preventive Services Task Force  USPSTF  \nBRCA guideline recommends that primary care providers \nassess women for increased risk for BRCA mutations using \nfamily health history to identify women who might benefit \nfrom genetic counseling  1  The National Comprehensive \nCancer Network  NCCN  guidelines specify family and \npersonal history criteria that warrant additional genetic \nrisk assessments  3  In addition  the USPSTF and NCCN \n\nguidelines review preventive interventions for women \nidentified with BRCA mutations  When a BRCA mutation is \nidentified  other family members can be tested for the known \nmutation  i e  cascade testing  to identify others at increased \nrisk for cancer  1 3  A Healthy People 2020 objective is to \nincrease rates of genetic counseling for women with a family \nhealth history indicating an increased risk for breast or ovarian \ncancers  9  BRCA genetic counseling and testing are usually \ncovered  in network without cost sharing  by most health \ninsurance plans as preventive services when used in accordance \nwith USPSTF recommendations  10 \n\nBRCA testing guidelines generally recommend both pretest \nand posttest genetic counseling by a trained health care provider \n 1 11  As of 2016  approximately 5 000 genetic counselors \nwere practicing in the United States  12  The geographic \ndistribution of genetic service providers has historically been \nuneven  with a concentration in urban areas and academic \nmedical centers  However  a 2016 survey of genetic counselors \nfound that nearly half reported serving smaller  more rural \npopulations  12  Alternative genetic services delivery models  \nsuch as telephone counseling  13  outreach clinic services \n 14  and telemedicine genetic services  15–17  are being \nincorporated by genetic counselors to complement in-person \ncounseling and to help improve overall access to care  e g  in \nrural areas  In addition  genetic services  such as BRCA genetic \ncounseling and testing  are being offered by specialists who \nare not geneticists  including oncologists and obstetrician-\ngynecologists  18 19 \n\nA comparison of changes over time in BRCA testing rates \nand receipt of preventive interventions after BRCA testing in \nurban and rural areas at the national and regional levels could \nhelp to document the evolution of differences in service use  \nHowever  the available data for monitoring BRCA testing in the \nU S  population and its subgroups are limited  For example  \nclaims data can be used to assess use of health services  and \nspecific billing codes for BRCA testing have been available since \n2001  20  However  BRCA test billing codes have changed \nover time  and before 2013  nonspecific billing codes were also \nused for BRCA testing  which hinders complete ascertainment \nof these tests from claims data  21  Furthermore  numerous \nfactors might influence variations in BRCA test use in the \nUnited States  For example  a substantial increase in BRCA \ntesting occurred in 2013 after publication of a celebrity’s \n\n\n\nSurveillance Summaries\n\nMMWR / September 8  2017 / Vol  66 / No  15 3US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\neditorial describing

direct-to-consumer advertising \ncampaign that was intended to raise awareness about BRCA \ntesting among women with a personal or family history of \nbreast or ovarian cancer  24  Racial/ethnic disparities in rates \nof BRCA testing and follow-up preventive services have been \nreported  25  attributed in part to socioeconomic factors and \nphysician referral patterns  26 \n\nTo examine differences over time and by census region in \nBRCA testing rates in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas \nin the United States  this report analyzes health claims data \nfrom the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial \nClaims and Encounters  CCAE  databases  This report presents \nrates of BRCA testing  for any reason other than testing for \nknown Ashkenazi mutations  from 2009 to 2014 among \nwomen aged 18–64 years  In addition  this report describes \nreceipt of preventive services  i e  mammography  breast MRI  \nand mastectomy  and genetic counseling among women who \nhad BRCA tests  These findings can be used by public health \nofficials and practitioners to better understand differences \nin the implementation of genomic medicine applications in \nmetropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas and identify areas of \npotential need and growth \n\nMethods\nMedical claims data from 2009 to 2014 for women aged \n\n18–64 years were extracted from Truven Health Analytics \nMarketScan CCAE databases  27  a proprietary data system \nintegrating information from inpatient services  outpatient \nservices  including laboratory tests  and outpatient pharmacies \nprovided by a nationwide convenience sample of employers \nand employer-sponsored commercial insurance plans that \ncover employees and their dependents  The MarketScan \nCCAE databases contain enrollment data and longitudinally \nlinked health care use and expenditure data  MarketScan \nclaims and patient-level information  including age  sex  \ngeographic location  diagnostic codes  and procedure codes  \nwere analyzed  Both partial-year and full-year enrollees \nwere included  Residential status  nonmetropolitan and \nmetropolitan  of enrollees was mapped from the five-digit zip \ncode of the

The residential status of women \nwho changed their status  i e  from nonmetropolitan to \n\nmetropolitan or the reverse  was determined by where they \nlived the most months during that year \n\nReceipt of both preventive-associated and treatment-\nassociated BRCA testing was ascertained from outpatient \nand inpatient claims  Claims of BRCA testing were extracted \nusing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System \n HCPCS  codes  S3818–S3823  and Current Procedural \nTerminology  CPT  codes  81211–81217  Four subtypes \nof BRCA tests were defined based on billing codes  full-gene \nsequencing  known mutation tests  Ashkenazi panel  and large \nrearrangement tests  which are typically done at the same \ntime as or after full-gene sequencing tests  Women who had \nBRCA panel tests for Ashkenazi mutations were excluded \nfrom the final analyses of BRCA testing rates to avoid inflating \ndifferences between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas \nbecause almost all Ashkenazi panel testing was concentrated \nin metropolitan areas  Women who had Ashkenazi panel \ntesting accounted for approximately 5% of women who had \nany BRCA testing during the study period and ≤0 1% of all \nwomen aged 18–64 years  When calculating BRCA testing \nrates  women who had Ashkenazi panel tests were excluded \nfrom the numerator   However  the data contain no measure \nof ethnicity that could be used to exclude women of Ashkenazi \nancestry from the denominator  \n\nThe annual calendar-year receipt rates of any BRCA test and \nsubtypes were calculated as follows  the number of women \nenrollees aged 18–64 years who had at least one claim in \nthe calendar year that contained one of the BRCA testing \nprocedure codes divided by the total number of women aged \n18–64 years enrolled at any point during that year  multiplied \nby 100 000  For each study year  enrollee age was defined as \nthe age on January 1  or at the start of enrollment period for \npartial-year enrollees  Rates also were calculated by age group \n 18–34  35–44  45–54  and 55–64 years  and by U S  census \nregion  Northeast  Midwest  South  and West   28  Adjusting \nBRCA

genetic service providers  The lower rate also might reflect \ngeneral factors such as poverty  lower educational attainment  \nand lack of health insurance  which have previously been \nimplicated in health care and preventive service access disparities \nin urban and rural areas  30  Although significant differences \nwere found in the sample age distribution between metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas  adjusting the BRCA testing rates by \nage did not change the general findings or conclusions \n\nBRCA mutations are found in all racial/ethnic groups  \nhowever  certain populations  notably Ashkenazi Jews  have \nboth higher frequencies of specific BRCA mutations and are \nconcentrated in metropolitan areas  which might therefore \ndifferentially affect metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA \ntesting rates  In this study  women who received BRCA testing for \nAshkenazi mutations were excluded to minimize potential bias \n\nThe decreased disparity in testing rates between metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas from 2009 to 2014 could reflect a \ndecreasing reliance on specialists for genetic testing for BRCA   \nIn 2013  the USPSTF recommendation stated that trained \nhealth professionals  including primary care providers  could \nprovide genetic counseling about BRCA mutation testing to \nidentify women deemed to be at risk for BRCA mutations based \non family history  1  Because small proportions of women \nwho received genetic testing for BRCA had claims for genetic \ncounseling throughout the period  both in metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas  differences in access to genetic \ncounseling services are unlikely to have been an important \nfactor  however  genetic counseling billing codes might not \ninclude all instances of counseling services  31 32 \n\nFinally  the coverage of BRCA counseling and testing under \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  ACA  when \nthese services are provided in accordance with USPSTF

during the study period  Although \nthe ACA provision that requires many health plans to \npromote in-network coverage without cost sharing for certain \nUSPSTF-recommended services became effective in September \n2010  a clarification issued in February 2013 might have \nincreased testing  along with other factors discussed  22–24  \nThis additional guidance specified that BRCA testing and \ncounseling  if determined appropriate by a woman’s health care \nprovider  is covered as a preventive service  10  A recent study \nshowed that in the 2 years after the 2013 ACA clarification  \nthe percentage of women with no out-of-pocket expenses \nincreased  33 \n\nThe relative difference in testing rates between metropolitan \nand nonmetropolitan areas generally decreased over the study \nperiod across all age groups but decreased most among women \naged 18–34 years and least among women aged 55–64 years  \nWomen aged 18–34 years had the highest relative growth \nin BRCA testing compared with older age groups for both \nmetropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas  Younger persons \nmight adopt the use of newer health care services more \nquickly  and access to services might present less of a barrier for \nyounger than for older age groups  34  The regional analyses \n\ndemonstrated that national increases in BRCA testing can mask \nimportant differences in population subgroups  For example  in \nthe West  BRCA testing increased more over the study period \nin metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas  unlike \nthe other regions examined  This might indicate that the West \nhas unique challenges in reaching nonmetropolitan areas with \nBRCA testing \n\nAmong women with BRCA mutations  lower receipt of \npreventive services such as MRI in nonmetropolitan areas \ncould reflect barriers to access  lower risk for having a BRCA \nmutation among those tested  or a higher proportion of BRCA \ntesting performed based on family health history compared \nwith personal history of cancer  The percentage of women \nwho received a mastectomy or an MRI after BRCA testing \npeaked in 2011 both in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan \nareas  the decreasing percentages observed from 2012 to 2014 \ncould reflect a shift over time toward a higher proportion of \nBRCA testing done based on family health history compared \nwith personal history of cancer  35  The percentage of women \nwho received a mastectomy was similar in metropolitan and \nnonmetropolitan regions within 90 days and 1 year after BRCA \ntesting  however  a longer follow-up period might

specific to BRCA testing  Claims data also might \nbe subject to recording errors or adjudication errors  and the \nreliability of the coding of BRCA tests might have changed over \ntime  These factors might have affected the completeness of \nascertainment of BRCA tests  particularly before 2013  21 41  \nThird  the OMB metropolitan-nonmetropolitan classification \nscheme is an imperfect proxy for rural-urban classification for \nseveral reasons  For example  large metropolitan areas might \ncontain rural areas that might be far from an urban center  \nwhich might reduce the overall rates of BRCA testing observed \nin metropolitan areas and present an incomplete assessment of \nBRCA testing in nonmetropolitan areas due to misclassification  \nIn addition  residence in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan \narea was determined by the primary beneficiary  who might \nhave lived in a different area than the woman who received \nthe test  e g  young women who were on a parent health \ninsurance plan but did not live with the parent and spouses \nwho were on the same insurance plan but lived in different \nstates  Residence in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area \nmight have changed at the time of BRCA testing and might \nalso have changed for multiyear enrollees  Among women who \nhad BRCA testing  <1% had testing over multiple years  and \n<1% of those changed residential status  Fourth  the outcomes \nof BRCA tests and whether women met current BRCA testing \nguidelines could not be determined from medical claims data  \nTherefore  determining whether the lower levels of testing in \nnonmetropolitan areas represented proportionately lower use \nof appropriate testing compared to metropolitan areas was \nnot possible  Finally  the billing codes used to identify genetic \ncounseling services were expected to identify only a fraction \nof women who received genetic counseling because genetic \ncounseling is often billed under evaluation and management \ncodes when attended by a physician  31 32  and counseling \nmight be provided by clinicians other than genetic counselors  \nTherefore  these findings underestimate receipt of genetic \ncounseling services  Mammography and MRI percentages \nare likely overestimates because both screening and diagnostic \nindications are included  42 \n\nConclusion\nAlthough BRCA testing rates were lower in nonmetropolitan \n\nareas  they increased proportionally more than in metropolitan \nareas  Regional and age differences in BRCA testing rates reveal \nspecific population subgroups with greater metropolitan and \nnonmetropolitan differences  Administrative data used in this \nreport can help public health officials monitor changes over \ntime in the differences in BRCA testing rates and receipt of \n\npreventive services between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan \npopulations to address differences in BRCA testing rates  \nspecifically  and  possibly  genetic services  in general  However  \nadministrative data cannot be used to assess compliance with \nrecommendations for testing and preventive services  To \nmonitor the extent to which BRCA testing rates and receipt \nof preventive interventions after BRCA testing adhere to \nevidence-based guidelines and result in actions likely to prevent \ndeath from certain cancers  improved surveillance tools are \nneeded to determine the indications for and results of BRCA \ntesting  CDC funds state health departments to promote the \napplication of best practices for evidence-based breast cancer \ngenomics through

endocrine\ntherapy  and targeted therapy  overall survival rates of breast\ncancer have increased  however  these therapies have not\nproduced signiﬁcant changes in the prognosis of patients with\nbreast cancer accompanied by distant metastasis \nThe main sites of metastasis for breast cancer are the bone \n\nlung  and liver  whereas metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is\nrelatively rare  reported incidence rates are 2% to 18% of breast\ncancer cases  Importantly  gastric metastasis from invasive\nlobular breast carcinoma is reported to occur at a higher rate\nthan the metastasis from invasive ductal carcinoma [2] Gastric\ncancer has high incidence rates in Korea [1] and differentiation\nbetween primary gastric cancer and metastatic gastric cancer\nbased solely on clinical

to be\nlower for the diagnosis of gastric cancer compared with\nother cancer types  and this is attributed to issues\nd with physiological absorption of F-18 ﬂuorodeox-\nand involuntary movements by the gastric wall  Gastric\norphology is also associated with sensitivity of PET \nh the sensitivity of PET is high for papillary or ductal\na and poorly differentiated solid adenocarcinoma  high\native rates are reported for signet ring cell carcinoma and\nifferentiated nonsolid adenocarcinoma [4]\n\neral  it is difﬁcult to differentially diagnose primary\nancer and metastatic gastric

regions\nof the gastrointestinal tract in most cases  surgical treatment of\ngastric tumors is not recommended as a primary treatment\noption  Surgical treatment  such as bypass surgery  may be used\nin cases of complete intestinal obstruction or in emergencies  such\nas perforation of the gastric wall  McLemore et al treated some\npatients with gastric metastasis using conventional surgical\nprocedures for symptom relief  and reported no increase in\nsurvival rates after surgery  Speciﬁcally  they reported that the\npatient’s history of undergoing chemotherapy or

outcome\n\nduction\n\nncer  BC  is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy\nleading cause of cancer death among women\n\nworldwide [1] Although early detection and comprehensive\ntreatment have been implemented  the 5-year survival rate\namong patients with BC who develop metastatic disease is only\n24% [2] To improve the clinical outcome of patients  there is an\nurgent need for the development of early biomarkers that could\nprovide prognostic information regarding treatment response\nand disease progression \nAt present  evaluation of the metabolic tumor burden in BC is\n\ndependent on serum markers  including Cancer Antigen 15-3\n CA15-3  and Carcinoembryonic Antigen  CEA  The major\nissues with using these markers  however  are a lack of sensitivity\nand speciﬁcity  especially in early or localized disease [3 4]\n\nTherefore  in recent years  much effort has been devoted to the\ndetection and characterization of circulating cell-free DNA\n cfDNA  in BC  cfDNA is nucleic acid fragments that circulate in\nthe plasma  serum  and other bodily ﬂuids outside of cells  The\nﬁrst report was by Mandel and Metais in 1948 [5] but the topic\nattracted little attention in the scientiﬁc community  It was not\nuntil 1977 that cfDNA was recognized as a useful tool for\nmonitoring the effects of therapy in cancer patients [6] In healthy\nindividuals  cfDNA is derived from apoptotic cells and is\n\nted  measuring 185 to 200 base pairs  bp  in length \nas in cancer patients it results from apoptotic and necrotic\n\ncells [7 8] Therefore  elevated levels of long DNA

46%\n\nfrom 1995 to 2015 1 and it is now the most common cancer and the\n\nfifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Japanese\n\nwomen 2 Globally  between 5% and 10% of breast cancers are meta-\n\nstatic at the time of diagnosis 3 and ABC  including recurrent disease\n\nand mBC  is incurable 4 posing a significant public health burden and\n\nconsiderable treatment challenges 5\n\nFor postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC  endocrine therapy\n\nwith agents such as aromatase inhibitors  eg  anastrozole  letrozole \n\nor exemestane  is the standard first-line treatment6 and is recom-\n\nmended by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guide-\n\nlines 7 However  current first-line endocrine therapy alone may\n\nprovide only modest benefit in patients with HR+ ABC  and some\n\npatients may not respond at all 6 indicating the need for new treat-\n\nment options  In a randomized phase III trial of exemestane vs anas-\n\ntrozole as first-line therapy in Japanese women with HR+ ABC \n\nmedian time to progression was approximately 12 months in each\n\ngroup 8 Thus  there is interest in improving outcomes by combining\n\nfirst-line endocrine therapy with other agents \n\nPalbociclib is a potent  orally active  highly selective inhibitor of\n\nCDK4/6  it actively arrests cell cycle progression from the G1 phase\n\nto the S phase to inhibit DNA synthesis and the pathologic cellular\n\nproliferation characteristic of breast malignancies 9-11 Palbociclib\n\nshowed antiproliferative activity alone and synergistic activity with\n\ntamoxifen in ER+ luminal breast cancer cell lines 10 In clinical trials in\n\nnon-Japanese patients with retinoblastoma protein-positive solid\n\ntumors  single-agent palbociclib showed antitumor efficacy with an\n\nacceptable safety profile and was well tolerated 12 13 In an open-\n\nlabel  phase II PALOMA-1 trial  efficacy and safety of first-line letro-\n\nzole  2 5 mg QD  alone or in combination with palbociclib  125 mg\n\nQD  3 weeks on  1 week off [3/1 schedule]  was investigated in\n\nnon-Japanese postmenopausal women with ER+ and HER2  ABC 14\nMedian PFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than\n\nwith letrozole alone  20 2 vs 10 2 months  respectively  HR  0 49 \n\n95% CI  0 32-0 75  one-sided P =  0004  AEs with combination ther-\n\napy were predictable and manageable  neutropenia was the most\n\ncommonly reported AE 14 These findings were confirmed in the\n\nphase III PALOMA-2 trial in postmenopausal women with ER+/\n\nHER2  ABC who received letrozole with or without palbociclib  3/1\nschedule  as first-line therapy 15 Consistent with PALOMA-1  median\n\nPFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than with\n\nletrozole monotherapy  24 8 vs 14 5 months  HR  0 58  95% CI \n\n0 46-0 72  two-sided P  480 ms  based\n\non the mean value of triplicate ECGs  family or personal history of\n\nQT syndrome were also ineligible \n\n2 3 | Study treatment\n\nPatients received 125 mg palbociclib orally QD with food on days 1\n\nto 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off palbociclib treat-\n\nment  coadministered with letrozole 2 5 mg orally QD  Study treat-\n\nments were continued until radiologically documented PD according\n\nto RECIST  v1 1  symptomatic deterioration  unacceptable toxicity \n\nor withdrawal of consent \n\nPalbociclib dose interruptions or delays were permitted if patients\n\nexperienced the following protocol-specified treatment-related AEs \n\nuncomplicated grade 3 neutropenia  ANC  480 ms  more frequent ECG monitoring occurred per the investiga-\n\ntor’s best medical judgment until QTc was ≤480 ms  If these criteria\n\nwere met within 2 weeks of the dose interruption or cycle delay  pal-\n\nbociclib treatment was resumed  If not  resumption or permanent dis-\n\ncontinuation of palbociclib treatment was based on the investigator’s\n\nbest medical judgment of whether the patient was deriving clinical\n\nbenefit from treatment \n\nProtocol-specified palbociclib dose reductions were permitted \n\ndepending on the type and severity of toxicity reported  The recom-\n\nmended first dose reduction was from 125 to 100 mg/d  and the\n\nrecommended second dose reduction was from 100 to 75 mg/d \n\nPatients requiring >2 palbociclib dose reductions were discontinued\n\nfrom the study but remained in the follow-up phase  Subsequent\n\ntreatment cycles were given at the reduced dose level  dose re-esca-\n\nlation was not permitted  Patients who continued receiving letrozole\n\nremained in the active treatment phase of the study \n\nLetrozole dose interruptions for treatment-related toxicities were\n\npermitted based on the investigator’s judgment  Letrozole dose\n\nreductions were not permitted  Patients who discontinued letrozole\n\nbecause of treatment-related toxicity also discontinued palbociclib\n\nand  consequently  were discontinued from the active treatment\n\nphase of the study and instead entered the follow-up phase \n\n2 4 | Assessments\n\n2 4 1 | Efficacy\n\nDisease assessments included computed tomography or magnetic res-\n\nonance imaging of the chest  abdomen  pelvis  and any other sites of\n\ndisease as clinically indicated  clinical assessment of superficial disease\n\n including lesion measurements  and radionucleotide bone scans  All\n\nbaseline assessments were carried out before giving study drugs  pal-\n\nbociclib and letrozole  Postbaseline tumor assessments were done\n\nevery 12 weeks and bone scans  if applicable  every 24 weeks until\n\nevidence of disease progression  Radiographic disease progression\n\nusing RECIST or clinical disease progression  if photographed or palpa-\n\nble lesions  was assessed  Objective tumor response  using RECIST \n\nwas reported as ORR  percentage of patients with CR + PR  and DCR\n\n percentage of patients with CR + PR + stable disease lasting\n\n≥24 weeks  All radiographic or clinical  where applicable  efficacy\n\nevaluations were based on investigator assessments  OS was deter-\n\nmined every 6 months from the last dose of study treatment \n\n2 4 2 | Pharmacokinetics\n\nA subset of 6 patients underwent intensive PK sampling  and blood\n\nsamples were taken on cycle 1/day 15 at predose and at 1  2  4  6 \n\n8  10  and 24 hours after dosing  then at predose on cycle 2/day 15 \n\nFor this subset  plasma concentration-time data obtained after study\n\ndrug administration on cycle 1/day 15 were analyzed using non-\n\ncompartmental analysis methods to determine the following PK\n\nparameters  Cmax  tmax  AUCs  and CL/F  For assessment of palboci-\n\nclib plasma Ctrough  blood samples from all patients were collected on\n\nday 15 of cycles 1 and 2 before giving study drug  Plasma samples\n\nwere analyzed for palbociclib concentrations using a validated HPLC\n\nmethod with tandem mass spectrometry at PPD Development  Rich-\n\nmond  VA  USA  Lower limit of quantification for palbociclib was\n\n1 00 ng/mL \n\nMASUDA ET AL  | 805\n\n\n\n2 4 3 | Safety\n\nSafety was assessed by treatment-related AEs and clinically signifi-\n\ncant changes in physical examination findings or abnormal laboratory\n\nassessments  AEs were reported throughout the study using Med-\n\nDRA version 18 1  International Council for Harmonisation  Geneva \n\nSwitzerland  and protocol-specified clusters of preferred terms \n\nbased on incidence  severity  using Common Terminology Criteria for\n\nAdverse Events  version 4 0  and investigator-assessed relationship\n\nto study treatment  Physical examinations and 12-lead ECGs were\n\ncarried out at baseline  day 1 of each cycle  and at the end of treat-\n\nment  Laboratory assessments  hematology and blood chemistry \n\nwere conducted at baseline  days 1 and 15 of cycle 1  and on day 1\n\nof each subsequent cycle \n\n2 5 | Statistical analyses\n\nPrimary endpoint of this study was the 1-year PFS probability of the\n\nlower limit of the 90% CI exceeding 40%  which would correspond\n\nto a median PFS of 9 months  assuming that PFS had an exponential\n\ndistribution  Sample size for this study was 32 patients to meet the\n\nabove criteria with a >80% probability based on the assumption that\n\nmedian PFS for patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole was\n\n18 months  Accounting for a 20% potential patient drop-out  total\n\nenrollment target was 40 patients \n\nThe FAS  defined as all patients who received ≥1 dose of palbociclib \n\nwas used for all efficacy analyses  Primary endpoint of 1-year PFS was\n\ndefined as the proportion of patients without PFS events  ie  PD or\n\ndeath from any cause  at 12 months after the first palbociclib dose  PFS\n\nand 90% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method \n\nSubgroup analyses of PFS were carried out to investigate the\n\neffects of baseline disease characteristics  ie  visceral vs non-visceral\n\nmetastases  length of disease-free

disease control  low\n\ntoxicity profile  and tolerability 26 Newer hormonal agents have\n\nimproved outcomes to some degree  but combination therapies of\n\nhormonal agents with agents targeting
