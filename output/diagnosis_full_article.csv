Background—Researchers are increasingly interested in using observational data to evaluate \ncancer outcomes following treatment  including cancer recurrence and disease-free survival  \nBecause population-based cancer registries do not collect recurrence data  recurrence is often \nimputed from health claims  primarily by identifying later cancer treatments after initial treatment  \nThe validity of this approach has not been established \n\n Research Design—We used the linked SEER- Medicare data to assess the sensitivity of \nMedicare claims for cancer recurrence in patients very likely to have had a recurrence  We selected \nnewly diagnosed stage II/III colorectal  CRC n=6 910  and female breast cancer  n=3 826  \npatients during 1994–2003 who received initial cancer surgery  had a treatment break  and then \ndied from cancer in 1994–2008  We reviewed all claims from the treatment break until death for \nindicators of recurrence  We focused on additional cancer treatment  surgery  chemotherapy  \nradiation therapy  as the primary indicator  and used multivariate logistic regression analysis to \nevaluate patient factors associated with additional treatment  We also assessed metastasis \ndiagnoses and end-of-life care as recurrence indicators \n\n Results—Additional treatment was the first indicator of recurrence for 38 8% of CRC patients \nand 35 2% of breast cancer patients  Patients ages 70 and older were less likely to have additional \ntreatment  p<0 05  in adjusted analyses  Over 20% of patients either had no recurrence indicator \nbefore death or had end-of-life care as their first indicator \n\n Conclusions—Identifying recurrence through additional cancer treatment in Medicare claims \nwill miss a large percentage of patients with recurrences

outcomes such as recurrence and \ndisease-free survival  DFS  following cancer treatment  Population-based cancer registries \ncollect information about all incident cancers reported within defined geographic areas and \nsome registries also conduct follow-up of their patients to determine vital status  However  \nregistries do not collect or report information on cancer recurrence  Registry collection of \nrecurrence and timing of recurrence data would be logistically challenging and very costly  \nCurrently information on recurrence has been limited to data reported from clinical trials  \nwhich include only small numbers of patients and are not representative of cancer patients \noverall \n\nTo overcome the lack of recurrence information in the cancer registry data  researchers have \nused health claims to impute recurrence and DFS for cancer patients by identifying claims \nfor cancer treatment or metastatic disease after the initial treatment period  Validations of \nimputed recurrence from claims against medical records have been limited by very small \nsample sizes and lack of generalizability 1 2\n\nDespite the lack of population-based validation  a number of studies have used health claims \nto impute cancer recurrence 3–10 These studies have primarily defined recurrence through \nalgorithms that have identified surgery  chemotherapy or radiation therapy  RT  administered \nbeyond the time of initial treatment  as reported on Medicare claims  This approach will \nmisclassify patients if they do not receive treatment for their recurrence  a particular concern \nfor elderly patients who are not offered or may decline additional cancer treatment  To date  \nthere has been no population-based assessment of the sensitivity of Medicare claims for \nidentifying recurrences from treatment-based algorithms \n\nIn this study  we used the linked SEER-Medicare data to assess the sensitivity of Medicare \nclaims to capture recurrence for patients diagnosed with Stage II/III colorectal  CRC  or \nfemale breast cancers  We chose these cancers and stages because they are common and \nthese patients are likely to undergo initial curative treatment  with a sizeable percentage \nhaving cancer recurrence following their initial care \n\nAlthough the SEER-Medicare data do not explicitly capture recurrence  we identified \npatients very likely to have had a recurrence  those with only a single cancer diagnosis who \nwere surgically treated  had a cancer treatment-free interval  and later died from their cancer  \nOur assessment included reviewing Medicare claims for possible indicators of recurrence \nfollowing initial care  Our primary focus was whether claims for additional cancer treatment \n defined as surgery  chemotherapy and RT  were sensitive indicators of whether a patient \nhad a recurrence  We assessed if there was variation in the characteristics of patients who \nreceive additional treatment for recurrence  In addition  we assessed if other measures-- \ndiagnosis codes for metastasis or end-of-life care-- were sensitive indicators of recurrence  \nFor an indicator of recurrence to be useful for studies of disease-free survival  it must be \nreported accurately near the time when the recurrence was first diagnosed  Therefore  we \nalso examined the timing of each of the indicators in relation to time of diagnosis and death \n\nWarren et al  Page 2\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor

National Cancer Institute’s  NCI  Surveillance  Epidemiology and End \nResults  SEER  registries to Medicare claims 11 The SEER data are population-based and \ninclude clinical information about incident cancer for patients living within defined \ngeographic areas  representing approximately 28% of the US population 12 For each patient  \nthe SEER data contain a unique case number  demographic information such as age  sex and \nrace  the number of primary incident cancers  month and year of diagnosis  type of surgery \nperformed  site and stage of disease at diagnosis  and vital status  For patients who died  \ninformation about the month and year of death and underlying cause of death was obtained \nfrom the National Death Index  Cause of death on death certificates is reportedly \nindependently of diagnoses reported on claims  The Medicare data used in this analysis \ninclude all inpatient hospitalizations  outpatient hospital services  physician services  durable \nmedical equipment claims  and hospice service for beneficiaries with fee-for-service \ncoverage  All files include dates of service and codes for specific diagnoses and procedures \nusing either ICD-9-CM codes  Health Care Procedure Codes  HCPCS  or National Drug \nCodes  NDC  For persons reported to SEER who were age 65 or older  94% have been \nlinked to the Medicare enrollment file  Using the linked SEER-Medicare data allowed us to \ntrack patients across time from cancer diagnosis until death  The NIH's Office of Human \nSubjects Research has determined that the SEER-Medicare data are exempt from human \nsubjects regulations \n\n Sample selection\nThe cohorts included all beneficiaries ages 65 and older who were diagnosed between 1994 \nand 2003 with Stages II or III CRC  n=18 127  or female breast cancer  n=8 173  as their \nonly primary cancer who also died of cancer between 1994 and 2008  Patients identified \nonly from death certificates or autopsy were excluded  CRC n=30  breast n=11  To ensure \nthat all claims were available  patients were required to be enrolled in Medicare Part A and \nPart B coverage and not in an HMO from the month of their diagnosis until death  excluded  \nCRC n=5 560  breast n=2 514  All patients were required to have received cancer-directed \nsurgery as initial treatment within 4 months of their cancer diagnosis  Cancer-directed \nsurgery was identified from Medicare claims  If no surgery could be identified from the \nMedicare data  then surgery was identified from the SEER data  Patients without cancer-\ndirected surgery were excluded  CRC n=2 160  breast n=1 085 \n\n Identification of Surveillance Period to Ascertain Recurrences\nTo identify the “surveillance period”  the time after initial treatment when recurrences could \nbe identified  we reviewed health claims from cancer diagnosis until death  For each patient  \nwe divided the claims after diagnosis into three periods  initial treatment  treatment-free \ninterval  and surveillance  Figure 1  The initial treatment period started on the date of \ncancer-directed surgery as reported on the Medicare claim or  if cancer directed surgery was \nonly identified from the SEER data  and no date of service was available  the last day of the \nmonth of diagnosis  Many patients received adjuvant therapy following their surgery  and as \n\nWarren et al

M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\na result  the ending date for the initial treatment period for patients receiving adjuvant \ntherapy was later than for those who only had surgery  To determine whether a patient \nreceived adjuvant therapy  we reviewed Medicare claims for 4 months following the date of \nsurgery to identify bills for chemotherapy or RT  If adjuvant therapy was not identified  \npatients were defined as having surgery only and their initial treatment period was defined as \n4 months after the date of surgery  For patients who received adjuvant therapy  we reviewed \ntheir claims for up to 12 months following the date of surgery to determine when their \nadjuvant treatment ended  defined as no claims for chemotherapy or RT for 90 consecutive \ndays  The date from the last adjuvant treatment claim was the end date of their initial \ntreatment period  Patients could have a break in adjuvant treatment of up to 60 days  \npotentially reflecting adverse events from chemotherapy or a short term delay  We excluded \npatients with a break in treatment of more than 60 days but less than 90 days because we \ncould not determine if the resumption of treatment after an extended break reflected \nadditional initial therapy or treatment for recurrent disease  We also excluded patients whose \ninitial treatment extended beyond 12 months  CRC n=3 467  breast n=737 \n\nThe treatment-free interval was defined as 90 days following the end date of the initial \ntreatment period  Following the last date of the treatment-free interval  patients entered the \nsurveillance period  The surveillance period extended until the last day of their month and \nyear of death  The surveillance period was the focus of our study for reviewing indicators of \nrecurrence \n\n Indicators of Recurrence\nDuring the surveillance period  we reviewed Medicare hospital  physician  outpatient facility \nand durable medical equipment claims for additional cancer therapy-chemotherapy  RT  or \ncancer-related surgical procedures  Our evaluation did not include hormone therapy for \nbreast cancer patients as most elderly breast cancer patients initiate hormone therapy at the \ntime of diagnosis and continue treatment for five years following diagnosis  We also \nreviewed claims for metastasis diagnosis and end-of-life care  including services such as \nhospice care and pain management  A complete list of diagnoses and procedures used for \neach indicator of recurrence can be found in the Appendix  Table \n\n Defining the Time of Recurrence\n First Indicator of Recurrence—We reviewed claims to determine which indicator of \nrecurrence was found as the first indicator  Because more than one indicator could occur \nsimultaneously  we created a mutually exclusive hierarchy for defining the first indicator  \nadditional therapy  diagnosis of metastatic disease  or end-of-life care  Some patients with a \nmetastasis diagnosis as their first indicator may have been referred shortly thereafter for \nadditional treatment  Therefore  we reviewed their claims to determine if they received \nadditional therapy within 2 weeks of the metastasis diagnosis  If additional therapy was \nidentified  we classified the first indicator as being “additional therapy” rather than a \nmetastasis diagnosis  We also determined the number of patients with no indicator of \nrecurrence \n\nWarren et al  Page 4\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\nGiven increasing interest in measuring disease-free survival  we compared the median time \nfrom diagnosis until recurrence for each first indicator of recurrence  We also estimated for \neach first indicator the median time from recurrence until death  Median times are presented \nin forest plot graphs  showing variation in median time by reporting the lower and upper \nquartiles  We report median times instead of mean times  as the means were skewed by \noutliers \n\n Assessing Patient Factors Associated with Receipt of Additional Therapy\nBecause prior studies have used receipt of additional cancer treatment to impute \nrecurrence 3–10 we calculated the percent of patients who had additional treatment at at any \ntime during the surveillance period  We used separate multivariate logistic regression \nmodels to assess the association between stage at diagnosis  patient age  race or sex and \nreceipt of additional treatment for CRC and breast cancer patients  All analyses were \nperformed using SAS software  version 9 2  SAS Institute Inc  Cary  NC \n\n RESULTS\nThe final cohort included 6 910 CRC patients and 3 826 breast cancer patients   Table 1  \nSixty-four percent of CRC patients and 56 6% of breast cancer patients were age 75 and \nover  Most CRC patients presented with Stage III cancer  59 7%  whereas most breast \ncancer patients presented with stage II  74 2%  To evaluate potential biases introduced by \nour cohort selection  we compared the age at diagnosis for patients in our cohort with all \nelderly CRC and breast patients in the SEER-Medicare data who had the same clinical \npresentation and years of diagnosis but did not die from cancer  The age distributions for the \ntwo cohorts were similar  although those who died from cancer were slightly more likely to \nbe age 75+ than those who did not die  CRC-64 1% vs  59 9%  breast cancer-56 7% vs  \n53 1%  Following diagnosis  mean survival for CRC patients was 34 3 months  with a mean \nof 25 9 months in the surveillance period  For breast cancer patients  mean survival was 45 6 \nmonths with 37 0 months in the surveillance period \n\n First indicator of recurrence\nFor both CRC and breast cancer patients  slightly more than one-third had additional therapy \nas their first indicator of recurrence  the type of additional therapy varied by cancer site and \nstage  Table 2  A diagnosis of metastatic disease  without additional therapy within 2 \nweeks  was also a common first indicator  reported in 36 0% of the CRC patients and 45 7% \nof the breast cancer patients  The remaining patients either had no indicator of recurrence or \nthe first indicator was end-of-life care  25 2% and 19 1% for CRC and breast cancer patients  \nrespectively \n\n Patient characteristics associated with additional cancer treatment\nThe percentage of patients ever having a claim for additional cancer therapy at any time \nduring the surveillance period was similar for CRC and breast cancer patients  60 0% and \n62 2%  respectively  data not shown  Patient characteristics were associated with receipt of \nadditional cancer treatment in adjusted analyses  Table 3  Older patients  particularly those \naged 80 and older  were significantly less likely to receive additional treatment compared to \n\nWarren et al

receive \nadditional cancer therapy than were men  OR= 0 87  95% CI  0 79–0 97 \n\n Timing of recurrence\nThe median time from diagnosis until the first indicator of recurrence varied by the cancer \nsite  stage at diagnosis  and indicator  Figure 2  For both CRC and breast cancer patients  \nthose with additional therapy as their first indicator of recurrence had shorter median times \nto recurrence than for those with other first indicators  For CRC patients  both metastasis and \nend-of-life indicators occurred about 2 months later than additional therapy  while for breast \ncancer patients  metastasis indicators and end-of-life indicators were found about 5 and 7 \nmonths later than additional therapy indicators  A reverse pattern was observed for the \nmedian time from the first indicator of recurrence until death  Figure 3  The longest median \nsurvival following first indicator of recurrence was observed for patients whose first \nindicator was additional treatment  while the shortest median survival was for patients with \nend-of-life care as the first indicator  7 months shorter for CRC patients and 10 months \nshorter for breast cancer patients \n\n DISCUSSION\nIn this study  we assessed the sensitivity of the Medicare claims to detect cancer recurrence \nin patients who received initial cancer directed treatment  had a treatment-free interval  and \nlater died from their cancer  Our results demonstrate that algorithms that rely only on \nascertainment of additional cancer treatment to identify recurrence will significantly \nunderestimate its frequency  Less than 40% of CRC and breast cancer patients had additional \ntreatment as their first indicator of recurrence and about a third never had additional \ntreatment reported in the Medicare claims  Patients who do not receive additional cancer \ntreatment were primarily persons ages 70 and older and for CRC  women  These findings \nsuggest that prior studies that have relied on additional treatment codes in the SEER-\nMedicare data to impute recurrence are systematically misclassifying recurrences  \nparticularly for elderly populations  and the findings should be interpreted cautiously  3–10\n\nWhile this study was conducted in CRC and breast cancer patients  we do not believe that \ntreatment-based algorithms would have better performance for patients with other \nmalignancies  Indeed  we expect that treatment-based algorithms would have poorer \nperformance for prostate cancer  Because a sizeable number of prostate cancer patients \neither do not receive any therapy at diagnosis  or receive hormone ablation therapy as \nprimary or neoadjuvant therapy  it is difficult to identify whether claims for additional \ntherapies such as surgery or RT represent primary therapy or secondary therapy at \nrecurrence \n\nMetastasis codes were found to be a frequent first indicator of recurrence in our analysis  \nPrior studies have reported a relatively low positive predictive value  PPV  of metastasis \ncodes on claims for identifying metastatic disease in the SEER-Medicare data  ranging from \n58–66% for breast cancer and 64–69% for colorectal cancer 13–15 Although the addition of \nmetastasis codes will improve the sensitivity of treatment-based algorithms for identifying \n\nWarren et al  Page 6\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript

patients will be incorrectly classified as having metastatic \ndisease when they do not  Thus  we conclude that metastasis codes on Medicare claims are \nnot an accurate way to identify recurrence \n\nAbout 25% of CRC patients and almost 20% of breast cancer patients either had no indicator \nof recurrence before death or had end-of-life care  shortly before death  as their first \nindication of recurrence  For these patients  there is no way to infer from claims when \nrecurrence was first diagnosed \n\nThis study has a number of strengths  We developed a definition of initial treatment that \nconsidered the variation of patterns of initial care  accounting for time required for adjuvant \ntherapy  This approach likely resulted in a more accurate identification for each patient of \nwhen initial treatment actually ended than if we had applied a fixed time for initial treatment \nto all patients  Our analysis included a large population-based cohort of Medicare enrollees \ndiagnosed with non-metastatic cancer who later died from cancer  Use of Medicare claims \nallowed for longitudinal tracking of recurrence indicators  Reporting of surgery  \nchemotherapy and RT from the Medicare and SEER data has been found to be \ncomplete 16–20 In addition  Medicare has a designated hospice benefit which allowed us to \nidentify accurately when patients initiated hospice care \n\nThere were also limitations with this study  The SEER-Medicare data do not report if and \nwhen a recurrence occurs  and as a result  we did not have a “gold standard”  such as a \nmedical record  to evaluate claims for identifying recurrence  Instead  we identified cohorts \nof patients who very likely experienced a recurrence - those with non-metastatic disease who \nreceived initial treatment  had a treatment-free interval and who died from their cancer  Our \napproach has face validity to capture a cohort of patients who had a recurrence  However  \nthis approach excluded patients with recurrence who did not die of cancer within the period \nof observation  Thus we were not able to assess the predictive value or specificity of the \nMedicare claims to identify recurrence  We attributed all hospice admissions to the patient \nhaving cancer  although some patients who died from their cancer may have had other \nconditions that resulted in the hospice admission  Some patients may have had evidence of \nrecurrence not captured in the Medicare claims  such as patients receiving care from other \ninsurers  e g  the Veteran’s Administration  In our analysis  we restricted the cohort to \npatients with a single cancer and any cancer death  relying on the death certificate for cause \nof death  There have been questions about the accuracy of cause of death on death \ncertificates for some conditions  However several studies that have focused exclusively on \ncancer have found high agreement between clinicians’ assessment of cause of death with \nwhat was reported from the death certificate  21–23 Finally  although the age distribution of \nthe Medicare patients who died from cancer was relatively similar to those with a \ncomparable clinical presentation who did not die from cancer  those who did not die from \ncancer may be more likely to have been treated or differed systematically from those who \ndied from their cancer  These findings may not be generalizable to younger populations who \nmay be more likely to receive cancer therapy following recurrence \n\nFindings from our analysis have practical implications for studies designed to use health \nclaims for studies of comparative effectiveness or cancer outcomes  With an increasing \n\nWarren et al  Page 7\n\nMed Care  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 August 01

expensive and \nchallenging to conduct  there is mounting interest in leveraging health claims to evaluate the \nreal world consequences of treatment interventions  For cancers with favorable prognosis  \noverall survival is an imperfect endpoint  Evaluation of disease-free and recurrence-free \nsurvival is of increasing importance  Unfortunately  our findings demonstrate that Medicare \nclaims are not a viable resource for estimating recurrence  Ideally  as software for electronic \nhealth records  EHR  is being refined  development of standardized approaches for defining \nand recording recurrence will be a priority for the oncology community  Such information \nwill enable improved cancer surveillance and better assessment of treatment effectiveness  \nUntil information from the EHR is available  use of Medicare data to assess recurrence will \nmiss many patients and those identified will not be representative of all patients with \nrecurrence \n\n Supplementary

integration of screening breast MRI into the ongoing \nfollow up of these women \n\nKeywords\nHodgkin Lymphoma  HL  Breast Imaging  Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging  MRI \n\nINTRODUCTION\nLong-term survivors of Hodgkin Lymphoma  HL  are at an increased risk of developing a \ntreatment-related secondary malignancy  1  In particular  girls and young women under the \nage of 30 treated with chest radiotherapy have a significantly increased lifetime risk of \ndeveloping breast cancer compared to the general population  2–4  Based on this increased \nrisk  the American Cancer Society  the American College of Radiology  and the Society of \nBreast Imaging recommend annual screening breast magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  as \nan adjunct to annual screening mammography for these patients  5  6  These \nrecommendations  based on expert consensus opinion  have evolved from the experience of \nscreening breast MRI in women with a strong family history of breast cancer or those with a \nBRCA 1 or 2 mutation  7  8 \n\nFor survivors of HL  however  there are limited data and experience as to how to optimally \nincorporate breast MRI into their long-term follow up and health maintenance  Although \nbreast MRI has a high sensitivity for detecting breast cancer  it has a modest specificity \ncompared to mammography  9  Furthermore  overall costs raise important questions  \nincluding timing of initiation of screening MRI  frequency of its use  and whether there are \nclinical and/or HL treatment-related factors that might predict which patients would benefit \nmost from additional breast imaging \n\nThe goal of the current study is to evaluate breast imaging in a group of women previously \ntreated with chest irradiation for HL  In this report  we review and characterize the \nmammographic and breast MRI findings as well as breast biopsies in a cohort of women \npreviously irradiated for HL to determine features that may help guide the optimal use of \nscreening breast MRI in this patient population \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWith institutional review board approval  a retrospective review of all patients treated with \nchest irradiation for HL at Stanford University Medical Center was performed  Between \n1961 and 2008  980 females were identified  Only those patients who had breast imaging \nperformed at our institution  including mammography and/or breast MRI  were included  as \noutside breast imaging studies were not available for review  Records were reviewed to \ndetermine the age at radiotherapy treatment  radiotherapy dose received  mammographic and \nbreast MRI findings  breast biopsy results if applicable  and the incidence of breast \ncarcinomas detected \n\nHorst et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available

oblique \nimages  When abnormal findings were identified  diagnostic mammography was performed \nto include lateral medial images as well as spot or magnification views as indicated  Since \n2002  mammography was performed using a GE 2000D Senographe or Essential digital \nmammography unit  GE Milwaukee  Wisconsin  equipped with R2 Computer Assisted \nDetection  CAD  systems  Sunnyvale  CA  Since 2004  all diagnostic mammography was \nperformed using digital technology  All mammographic and MR images were reviewed by \ndedicated  fellowship trained breast diagnostic radiologists  Imaging characteristics were \nreported according to the ACR BI-RADS Reporting System  10  Patients with suspicious or \nindeterminate mammographic findings underwent focused ultrasound  US  and US-guided \nor stereotactic biopsy if indicated  Pathology was recorded and correlated retrospectively \nwith the mammographic findings \n\nBreast MR imaging was performed in a 1 5-T scanner  Echospeed  GE Medical Systems  \nMilwaukee  WI  All images were obtained in the prone position with a dedicated phased \narray breast coil  MRI Devices  Waukesha  WI  Whole breast rapid dynamic MR images \nand high-spatial-resolution fat-nulled MR images were contemporaneously acquired by \nusing a combination of dynamic 3-dimensional  3D  spiral MRI to obtain initial kinetic \nenhancement curves during the wash-in phase of gadolinium  GD  contrast by methods \npreviously described  11–13  Intravenous GD  Gadoteridol  Bracco Diagnostics  Princeton  \nNJ or Magnevist  Berlex  Berlin  Germany  at a dose of 0 1 mmol/kg was infused as a rapid \nbolus at a rate of 2 to 3 mL/s using a power injector  Spectris  Medrad  Immediately \nfollowing this injection  high-spatial-resolution transfer  3DSSMT  imaging was done to \ncollect information regarding morphology followed by additional dynamic 3D spiral MRI to \nobtain delayed kinetic enhancement curves  The raw data were then post processed on the \nGE Advantage Windows workstation  Advantage Windows  GE  Milwaukee  WI   12  13  \nThese curves were classified as highly suspicious  rapid initial uptake with washout or \nplateau  indeterminate suspicion  rapid initial uptake with sustained late phase  or low \nsuspicion  slow uptake with a persistent late phase   12  The MRI was timed in relation to \nthe menstrual cycle in cases where it was feasible with respect to the patient’s availability  \nregularity of her cycle  and if it did not significantly delay any workup and treatment of a \npreviously diagnosed cancer  Menstrual cycle information was recorded on a breast history \nform that was available for evaluation by the diagnostic radiologist at the time of \ninterpretation  Screening MRI studies  defined as MRI studies performed as a screening \ntechnique without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer  were obtained annually  alternating \nevery 6 months with screening mammography  Diagnostic MRI studies  defined as \npreoperative breast MRI studies performed for workup of a breast cancer that was diagnosed \nby another modality  were obtained after completion of diagnostic mammography and/or \nultrasound \n\nMR imaging characteristics reported included size and morphology of any mass  the location \nin the breast  the description of mass margins  and the dynamic enhancement patterns \naccording to the ACR BI-RADS MRI Reporting System  14  15  Patients with suspicious or \nindeterminate MRI findings concerning for cancer underwent second-look focused US  If \nthe finding was identified by US  a biopsy was performed under US guidance  If the finding \nwas not seen by US  an MRI-guided biopsy was performed by methods previously described \n\nHorst et al  Page 3\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript

retrospectively with \nthe abnormal MRI findings \n\nPathology records for the needle biopsies performed by mammographic  US  or MRI \nguidance were reviewed and categorized as benign or malignant  The number of cancers \ndiagnosed  the method of detection  and the pathologic features were recorded  Descriptive \nstatistics were used to assess the type of breast imaging these patients received  the number \nof biopsies prompted by each imaging technique  the results of the biopsies  the incidence of \nbreast cancer  and the age and time since HL treatment for those diagnosed with a breast \nmalignancy  Given that the relative risk of developing breast cancer is greatest in those \npatients who were treated with chest irradiation at the age of 30 years or younger  3  17–20  \nthe data were also analyzed separately for those treated for HL ≤ 30 years of age  Data were \nalso assessed according to the era in which the breast cancer was diagnosed  as breast MRI \nwas not routinely available in most academic centers until 1995 and the ACR guidelines for \nscreening breast MRI were not introduced until 2007  5 \n\nRESULTS\nBetween 1961 and 2008  980 female patients were treated

1  3%  at the time of prophylactic mastectomy after a negative mammogram \nand MRI  and 1  3%  as an incidental finding on PET imaging for workup of a pleural \neffusion  Of the 10 cancers detected by palpable abnormalities  7 were interval cancers that \nappeared in between screening mammography  The remaining developed in women who \nhad not yet initiated screening mammography  Twenty-four cancers were invasive ductal \ncarcinoma with  n=8  or without  n = 16  ductal carcinoma in situ  DCIS  Eleven  31%  \nwere DCIS only  No patients in this cohort were diagnosed with invasive lobular

only began to utilize breast MRI in 1995  and that the \nACR guidelines for screening breast MRI were not introduced until 2007  the dates in which \npatients were diagnosed with breast cancer were reviewed  Table 6  Of the 35 cancers \ndiagnosed in 33 patients  1  3%  was diagnosed before 1995  This cancer was diagnosed by \nscreening mammography  with no screening MRI studies performed prior to 1995  Between \n1995 and 2007  62 screening mammograms and 8 screening breast MRI studies were \nperformed  Twenty-one cancers  60%  were diagnosed during this time  with 6 diagnosed by \npalpation  14 by screening mammography  and 1 by PET for evaluation of pleural effusion  \nAfter 2007  33 screening mammograms and 24 screening breast MRI studies were \nperformed in this cohort  Thirteen cancers  37%  were diagnosed after 2007  with 2 by \npalpation  10 by screening mammography  and 1 by prophylactic mastectomy \n\nDISCUSSION\nIt is well documented that young women treated with chest irradiation for HL have an \nincreased risk of breast cancer  particularly those treated before the age of 30 years  2  21  \nSince this risk appears to increase as early as 8 years after radiotherapy treatment  experts \nhave recommended that these women initiate screening mammography at age 25 or 8 years \nafter treatment  2  3  22  23  Many women in this risk category  however  are unaware of \ntheir increased risk and do not undergo regular screening mammography  24  25  Even with \nthe earlier initiation of screening mammography  many breast cancers are still detected by \npalpable findings on clinical examination  26 \n\nMore recently  screening breast MRI has been recommended for this patient population as \nan adjunct to mammography based on the observed risk  5–6  While breast MRI has a high \nsensitivity for detecting breast cancer  particularly for those with increased breast density  its \nroutine use has been controversial given the modest specificity that may result in false \npositive findings and benign biopsies  27  28  Since the establishment of these guidelines in \n2007  there have been limited data regarding patient compliance  biopsy rates  and cancer \ndetection rates in survivors of HL  The current study was designed to evaluate breast \nimaging practice patterns in this patient population at our institution leading up to the ACR \nguidelines for screening breast MRI \n\nWe found that despite the introduction of breast MRI in 1995  only 21% of the patients in \nour cohort underwent screening breast MRI  with 5% undergoing screening breast MRI only \nafter having been diagnosed with a contralateral breast cancer  An additional 12% \nunderwent preoperative MRI for workup of a breast cancer that had been established by \nanother modality  while the remaining 67% underwent mammography only  These data \nsuggest slow adoption of breast MRI in this cohort compared to its use in other high-risk \npatient groups  7 \n\nYet with the establishment of the ACR guidelines in 2007  there has been increased \nawareness of the potential benefit of screening breast MRI in addition to screening \nmammography  In a cohort of 91 women with a history of chest irradiation  Sung et al  at \nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 4 mammographically occult cancers \n\nHorst et al  Page 6\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 April 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nwith the use of screening breast MRI  29  These findings are similar to Freitas et al  at the \nUniversity of Toronto  where 4 breast cancers in a cohort of 98 women previously treated \nwith chest radiotherapy were diagnosed by screening MRI only  30 \n\nInterestingly  11 of the 35 cancers detected in our series  31%  were DCIS  which appeared \nas calcifications on mammography  This is similar to Sung et al  where 3 of 10 cancers \n 30%  identified were in situ carcinomas detected on screening mammography only  29  \nThe results of both series support the recommendation that MR imaging should be used as \nan adjunct to  and not in place of  mammography in this patient population \n\nOur study is limited by its retrospective nature from a single institution and its small sample \nsize with a limited number of breast MRI studies  It also is limited by potential selection \nbias  as we did not have complete information about the other female HL survivors who did \nnot have breast imaging performed at our institution to verify that the study population is not \na biased population  In addition  we did not have breast imaging studies that may have been \nperformed at outside institutions  Our results  however  provide preliminary information for \nthe design of future studies \n\nAn ongoing study by Ng et al at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Dana-Farber \nCancer Center is prospectively evaluating the role of screening breast MRI in women \npreviously treated with mantle irradiation for HL at age ≤ 35 and more than 8 years beyond \ntreatment  31  Preliminary results of 148 women demonstrated that while the addition of \nscreening breast MRI contributed to the detection of an additional 5 cancers that would have \notherwise been missed by mammography  it also resulted in 18 unnecessary biopsies in 14 \nwomen  Similar to our series  Ng et al reported one cancer  DCIS  that was identified on \nprophylactic mastectomy but was missed by imaging  further highlighting the need for even \nmore improvements in breast imaging \n\nFinally  when evaluating the use of breast MRI in this population  a main limitation is the \nera in which patients are evaluated and the time delay between introduction of an imaging \nmodality and its adoption into clinical practice  As our cohort only included imaging studies \nup until 2008  we were not able to evaluate the impact of the 2007 guidelines on the use of \nbreast MRI  Future studies will explore breast MRI after 2008 and its effect on breast cancer \ndetection \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe role of screening breast MRI in women previously irradiated for Hodgkin Lymphoma is \nevolving  Further education of patients and physicians is important to increase awareness of \nmore sensitive breast cancer screening modalities in this high-risk population  Additional \nstudies are warranted to determine the optimal timing and frequency of screening breast \nMRI with the goal of earlier detection and improved breast cancer outcomes in these \nwomen \n\nHorst et al  Page 7\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2017 April 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor

Oncology\n\nAshley Adams  BA\nSouth East Area Health Education Center\n\nAbstract\nPurpose—To analyze a multidisciplinary community experience with oncoplastic breast surgery \n OBS  and postoperative radiation therapy  RT \nMethods—The records of 79 patients with localized breast cancer who underwent OBS + RT \nwere reviewed  OBS included immediate reconstruction and contralateral mammoreduction  All \npatients had negative surgical margins  Whole breast RT was delivered without boost  A subset of \n44 patients agreed to complete a validated quality of life survey pre-RT  post-RT  6 months after \nRT  and at final follow-up assessing cosmesis and treatment satisfaction \n\nResults—Sixty seven patients  85%  were Caucasian  Median age was 62  Median interval \nbetween OBS and RT start was 9 6 weeks  Median RT dose was 46 Gy  Fourteen patients  18%  \ndeveloped surgical toxicities prior to RT  Five patients  6%  developed RT toxicities  Physician \nrating of cosmesis post-RT was  3% excellent  94% good  and 4% fair  Cosmesis was rated as \nexcellent or good by 87% of patients pre-RT  82% post-RT  75% at 6 months  and 88% at the final \nfollow-up  Treatment satisfaction was rated as “total” or “somewhat” by 97% of patients pre-RT  \n93% post-RT  75% at 6 months  and 96% at final follow-up  No significant relation was found \nbetween patient or treatment-related factors and toxicity  Local control is 100% at median follow-\nup of 2 9 years \n\nConclusions—OBS followed by RT resulted in acceptable toxicity and favorable physician-\nrated cosmesis in this large community series  Patients’ ratings of cosmesis and treatment \nsatisfaction were initially high  decreasing at 6 months  returning near baseline at final follow-up \n\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the past decade

oncologic and aesthetic outcomes  1–4  The existing medical \nliterature on this topic consists predominantly of surgical reports from university hospitals  \nMoreover  outcomes data are sparse in regard to combination treatment with OBS followed \nby postoperative radiation therapy  RT   5 6 \n\nCosmesis is a critical endpoint for breast conservation  There is strong evidence that after \nstandard lumpectomy followed by postoperative RT  cosmesis suffers with increasing breast \ntissue resection volumes  7–9  Since OBS techniques generally result in larger resection \nvolumes and increased surgical manipulation of breast tissue than lumpectomy  there is \nsignificant potential for worse aesthetic outcomes when OBS is followed by standard \npostoperative RT to the whole breast  10–12  In that regard  herein we present early \noutcomes  including patient reported cosmesis and satisfaction with OBS and RT at a large \ncommunity hospital \n\nMETHODS\nPatients with localized breast cancer who underwent OBS followed by standard RT at \nCoastal Carolina Radiation Oncology  CCRO  between July  2006 and February  2012 were \nreviewed  The protocol for gathering and reporting this data was reviewed and approved by \nthe Institutional Review Board of New Hanover Regional Medical Center  In 2011  the \nauthors initiated a prospective phase II clinical trial of hypofractionated RT after OBS and \nthese patients are excluded from the current analysis \n\nSurgery was performed as a single procedure in all cases  All patients had intraoperative \nevaluation of surgical margins by frozen section and  if initially positive  underwent \nimmediate re-excision  all with ultimately negative surgical margins  Patients underwent \npartial mastectomy with immediate ipsilateral reconstruction and contralateral \nmammoreduction  Reconstruction was achieved utilizing the Modified Wise pattern inferior \npedicle mastopexy in most cases  For patients with tumors in the 5 00 to 7 00 axis  a \nsuperior pedicle  superomedial pedicle  or free nipple graft were performed  Surgical \nmanagement of the axilla was dependent upon disease extent  During this time frame  \npatients found to have a positive sentinel node routinely underwent completion axillary \nnodal dissection \n\nThe time interval between surgery and the initiation of RT was recorded  Postoperative RT \nwas delivered utilizing standard fractionation of 1 8–2 0 Gy daily to the whole breast with \nno boost  since no tumor bed was discernible to target  The treating radiation oncologist’s \nevaluation of cosmesis was recorded at one to three months post-RT as  excellent  good  fair  \nor poor for each patient  No attempt was made to control for differences in perception of \ncosmesis among the treating physicians \n\nBeginning in November 2009  patients who had undergone OBS and were seen in \nconsultation at CCRO for consideration of postoperative RT were offered participation in a \nprospective quality of life analysis  These 44 patients agreed to complete the Radiation \nTherapy Oncology Group  RTOG  Quality of Life Baseline  QLB  questionnaire pre-RT  \npost-RT  and 6-months after RT assessing their cosmesis and satisfaction with treatment  \n\nMaguire et al  Page 2\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nFinal follow-up to assess patient reported cosmesis and treatment satisfaction was via \npersonal phone call from the lead author  The QLB questionnaire was the same instrument \nutilized for the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  NSABP  B39 trial  It \nincluded specific questions regarding breast size  shape  appearance and pain  as well as arm \npain and stiffness  However  for the purposes of the current analysis  patient reported \noutcomes were limited to overall cosmesis and treatment satisfaction  Possible choices for \npatients’ assessment of cosmesis were the same as those for physicians  excellent  good  fair  \nor poor  Patients were also provided choices within the QLB survey to describe their overall \ntreatment satisfaction pre-RT  post-RT  at 6 months  and at the final follow-up as  totally \nsatisfied  somewhat satisfied  neutral  somewhat dissatisfied  or unsatisfied  The first two \nchoices for this survey question were considered favorable \n\nDescriptive statistics were reported as frequencies  medians and ranges  A logistic regression \nanalysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of patient  tumor  and treatment \nfactors on the development of toxicity and ordinal logistic regressions assessed the \nrelationships between survey ratings and demographic/treatment variables  Comparisons of \nratings between pre-RT  post-RT  6MO  and final surveys were tested by using an \nANCOVA on the ranks  adjusting for the individual patient  Tests were run using SAS 9 0 \n SAS Institute  Cary NC  All tests were two tailed and a level of significance  α = 0 05 was \nused \n\nRESULTS\nDuring 2008–2011  79 patients were included in the study  Patients were predominantly \nCaucasian  85%  Table 1  with a median age of 61 9 years  The vast majority  91%  had \nAmerican Joint Commission on Cancer stage 0 – II disease \n\nAxillary surgery consisted of sentinel lymph node biopsy only in the majority of patients \n Table 2  Thirty patients  38%  received chemotherapy sequentially with RT  8  27%  of \nwhom received it neoadjuvantly  The median time interval between OBS and initiation of \nRT was 9 6 weeks  though this interval ranged from 3 to 35 weeks since 22 patients received \nchemotherapy adjuvantly  between surgery and RT  The median RT dose was 46 Gy \n\nFourteen patients  18%  developed surgical toxicities prior to the initiation of RT  Table 3  \nAmong 22 patients who underwent standard axillary lymph node dissection  4  18%  \ndeveloped symptomatic arm lymphedema  Other common surgical toxicities were mastitis \nand delayed wound healing  Five patients  6%  developed acute RT toxicities  all of which \nwere skin-related  The treating radiation oncologist rated patient cosmesis at 1–3 months \npost-RT as 3% excellent  94% good  and 4% fair  No significant relationship was found \nbetween toxicity and the treatment related variables of chemotherapy or radiation dose \n Table 4  At a median follow-up of 2 9 years  no patient had developed local or regional \nrecurrence \n\nBeginning in November 2009  forty-four patients received the RTOG QLB questionnaires \nfor prospective evaluation of their cosmesis and treatment satisfaction  Among this group  \n14 patients were excluded from the analysis for either not having completed a pre-treatment \n\nMaguire et al  Page 3\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor

22 subjects completed all baseline and follow-up \nquestionnaires for a complete response rate of 50%  However  those patients who had \ncompleted the pre-treatment survey and at least one follow-up survey were included  for an \noverall response rate of 68%  Figure 1 \n\nCosmesis was rated as excellent or good by 87% of patients pre-RT  82% post-RT  75% at 6 \nmonths  and 88% at the final follow-up  Patient ratings at pre-RT  post-RT  6 months  and at \nfinal follow-up were not significantly different from each other  nor did ratings significantly \nincrease or decrease over time  p = 0 7795  Table 5  An ordinal logistic regression of the \ncosmesis rating showed that age  whether chemotherapy was received  RT dose  time to RT  \nor follow-up time had no significant effect on pre-RT  post-RT  6 month  or final follow-up \nscores \n\nTreatment satisfaction was rated as “total” or “somewhat” by 97% of patients pre-RT  93% \npost-RT  75% at 6 months  and 96% at final follow-up  p = 0 1638  As with cosmesis  \nratings at each follow-up interval did not significantly differ from each other  There was a \nsimilar trend revealing lower treatment satisfaction at 6 months which improved at final \nfollow-up  The ordinal regression analysis showed no relationship between demographic or \ntreatment variables and treatment satisfaction  Though we tried to include race as a factor  \nthe inclusion of this variable in the regression analysis resulted in quasi-separation of data \ndue to small numbers  12 African American patients  which required this variable to be \nremoved from the model \n\nDISCUSSION\nThis report describes reasonable early results with breast conservation utilizing oncoplastic \nbreast surgery  OBS  followed by postoperative radiation therapy  RT  to the whole breast  \nReports from major university hospitals reveal favorable evaluations of cosmesis by the \ntreating surgeons  13–16  The current report reveals similar favorable  albeit early  \nevaluations by radiation oncologists  However  since evaluations were made by the treating \nphysician  bias is a factor  More importantly  patients’ prospective evaluation of early \ncosmesis and overall satisfaction with OBS followed by RT was relatively high  These \nresults are comparable to patients’ assessments of their aesthetic outcomes in reported \nsurgical series  17 18  There was a decrement in cosmesis as evaluated by patients at six \nmonths after completing surgery and RT  This difference was not statistically significant  an \nunsurprising result given the relatively small size of the group in this report  Unfortunately  \na control group of patients treated with OBS alone  no adjuvant RT  is lacking  Thus  it \nremains unknown whether the trend of decline in QOL scores at six months after completion \nof postoperative RT may be clinically significant  Potential reasons for this decline in \npatients’ perceived cosmesis at 6 months after treatment include RT fibrosis  progressive \nsurgical scarring  or merely patients’ evolving opinions of their cosmesis over time  The \nupward trend in patient reported cosmesis and treatment satisfaction between the 6 month \nmark and final follow-up is encouraging  However  since the final follow-up for these two \npatient reported outcomes was via phone call from the lead author  patients may have \nreported answers which they thought would be more pleasing to the physician \n\nMaguire et al  Page 4\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\nAuthor M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIn regard to long-term oncologic outcomes  the relatively short follow-up in the current \nreport limits meaningful commentary for this group of patients with early stage breast \ncancer  The surgical literature supports an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate ranging \nfrom 0–2% annually for patients with early stage disease treated with OBS  19–21  Details \nare lacking about delivery of postoperative RT in most OBS reports  making the current \nreport quite valuable  Because post-lumpectomy RT has been proven to improve not only \nlocal control but also survival  it remains a standard component of breast conservation \ntherapy  22  The potential to achieve more “widely negative” surgical margins with OBS \nmay tempt some surgeons to forego patient referral to radiation oncology  Unfortunately  \nthere is no data to substantiate the seemingly intuitive assumption that wider margins result \nin improved local tumor control or survival  Which subset of patients treated with \noncoplastic techniques for their breast conserving surgery  if any  does not require \npostoperative RT in order to minimize cancer recurrence risk  This question remains to be \nanswered  ideally via a clinical trial \n\nShorter RT fractionation schemes have proven to be safe and effective in randomized trials \nfor patients with early stage breast cancer treated with standard lumpectomy  23 24  \nHowever  theoretical concerns arise with respect to fibrosis when higher daily doses of RT \nare delivered after large volume breast resections  and in patients undergoing OBS  the \nsurgery is more extensive than that of a standard lumpectomy  Our group has initiated a \nphase II clinical trial evaluating cosmesis with hypofractionated RT after OBS to evaluate \nthis question  Accrual has been brisk and trial closure is anticipated in late 2013 \n\nThere are other limitations to the current study  The retrospective nature of the analysis on \nthe entire patient cohort  N=79  may have resulted in selection bias  The authors have \nattempted to account for this potential bias by including all patients who underwent OBS  \nwere referred for radiation oncology consultation  and underwent postoperative RT at \nCCRO  The quality of any retrospective case series is also dependent upon the accuracy and \ncompleteness of the medical record  No attempt was made to account for differences in \nperceived cosmesis among the treating radiation oncologists  The prospective subgroup \nassessment of cosmesis and overall treatment satisfaction is limited by small numbers and \nmoderate questionnaire response rate  Multivariate analysis of the potential impact of patient \nand treatment factors on toxicity revealed no clear correlation  though this type of analysis is \nalso hampered by small sample size  With a larger prospective patient cohort  as in our \nongoing clinical trial  comparisons over time  between baseline and post-treatment  may be \nmore meaningful \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOncoplastic breast surgery followed by standard whole breast RT yielded an acceptable \ntoxicity profile and favorable physician-rated cosmesis in this large community series  \nPatients’ ratings of cosmesis and treatment satisfaction were relatively high overall  with an \napparent nadir at 6 months after surgery and adjuvant RT  Late cosmesis  as well as long-\nterm oncologic outcomes  will be evaluated for a similar group of patients treated on our \nprospective phase II trial of oncoplastic breast surgery followed by hypofractionated RT \n\nMaguire et al  Page 5\n\nAm J Clin Oncol  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2016 August 01 \n\nAuthor

affects many dimensions of life and directs their cultural  \nsocioeconomic  and even political perspectives  Gunes Murat & Azadarmaki  2008 \n\nIslamic frameworks may lead Muslims to attribute the causes of illness  directly or \nindirectly  to God’s will  For example  a study of African American  Arab American  and \nSouth Asian American Muslims found that participants believed both health and illness to be \ndecreed by God  human agents were thought to play a secondary but complementary role \n Padela  Gunter  Killawi  & Heisler  2012  In another study of South Asian Muslim women  \nbreast cancer was often seen as a “disease of fate” ordained by God  Johnson  et al  1999  \nAmong Somalis in Minnesota  Deshaw also observed a fatalistic belief that disease \nexpresses the will of God  and the authors inferred that this notion may pose a barrier to \nseeking preventive care  DeShaw  2006  In a study of Arab American immigrants in New \nYork  respondents commented that cancer was a punishment from God for their religious \nfailings  Shah  et al  2008  To the extent that individuals see a particular illness as a result \nof God’s will or from their own spiritual failings  they may decide that that the illness is not \nto be treated  On the other hand  religious beliefs may also provide positive resources in the \nface of illness  as when faith in God provides psychological strength to a cancer patient \nundergoing chemotherapy  Powe & Finnie  2003 \n\nIn a positively-focused  Islamic-centered framework  however  Muslims might turn to Islam \nitself as a source of healing  Alrawi  et al  2011  Thus  if Muslims believe that health is \nconstituted by  and results from  observance of the teachings and practices of Islam  they \nmay turn to worship practices in order to restore their health  A study of Afghani elders in \nCalifornia found that they believed an individual’s health depended upon whether the \nindividual adhered to Islamic guidelines and performed religious rituals  and the elders \nengaged in worship practices for the purpose of healing  Morioka-Douglas  Sacks  & Yeo  \n2004  Other studies have found that that Muslim patients experience physical and mental \nbenefits from religious practices such as prayer  fasting  and recitation of the Qur’an \n Carroll  et al  2007  Indeed  many Islamic observances  like sexual monogamy  ritual \ncleansing  dietary strictures  and avoidance of alcohol and drugs  probably do promote \nhealth \n\nMuslims might also turn to traditional healing practices that are described in the Qur’an and \nthe hadith  These may include the use of black seed  herbs  and special foods like honey  \nOther practices  such as cupping  are prescribed or conducted by specialized healers  Alrawi  \net al  2011  Importantly  individuals may use Islamic healing practices in addition to  or in \nlieu of  the treatments offered by the professional medical domain  In the latter case  by \nturning to Islamic healing practices  some Muslims delay or altogether avoid seeking \nmedical attention from which they would benefit  There are few empirical studies to account \nfor how these decisions are made or to document how often such decisions occur \n\nPilot Study on Afghan Women’s Breast Health Behaviors\nIn 2007  with funding from University of California’s Breast Cancer Research Program  the \nauthors

Northern California view their breast health  The specific aims of the \nstudy were   1  to identify what Afghan community members believe to be their greatest \nconcerns and barriers to breast health care  including both cultural and religious attitudes \nthat may facilitate or hinder their seeking care  and  2  to identify the women’s knowledge \nabout and attitudes toward breast health care  Shirazi  Bloom  Shirazi  & Popal  2012  \nUsing Community Based Participatory Research  CBPR  the researchers worked \ncollaboratively with Afghan community members to frame the inquiry and distill the \ninformation gathered \n\nThe pilot study conducted in-depth  semi-structured interviews with 53 non-English \nspeaking  first generation immigrant  Muslim Afghan women  40 years and older  with no \nhistory of breast cancer  Study results indicated a very low level of knowledge about breast \ncancer in this group  low screening rates  and a lack of awareness of symptoms  risk factors  \nand screening procedures  Major barriers to screening included  an absence of culturally and \nlinguistically appropriate breast health education information and programs  language \ndifficulties  lack of transportation  low health literacy  embarrassment and modesty  Shirazi  \net al  2012 \n\nIn-depth interviews also highlighted the centrality of spiritual and Islamic beliefs in the lives \nof Afghan women  These women frequently mentioned the notion of faith  they believed \nhealth to be a blessing from God  Allah  and understood their bodies to be gifts from God  \nThey considered themselves responsible to do everything in their power to survive or \novercome health problems and to seek medical treatment as necessary  The women \ncommented that  in their religious faith  life is sacred and must be respected and protected \nwith care  Another religious matter was the women’s perspective of the status of women \naccording to Islam  Contrary to common Western stereotypes  many believed that Islam \nregards women as independent members of society who are equal to men in basic human \nrights and the pursuit of education and knowledge  Many expressed interest in reinforcing \nappropriate Islamic teachings as a way not only to empower women to acquire knowledge \nabout breast health care  but also to improve men’s understanding of the issues  Shirazi  et \nal  2012 \n\nThe pilot study’s results produced the following recommendations   1  Training of “grass \nroots” bilingual members of the community in all aspects of the program including planning  \ndesign  implementation  and evaluation   2  incorporation of male-specific educational \nsessions led by male health advisors   3  use of narrative communication consistent with the \nAfghan oral culture where storytelling is used to relate information and cultural/religious \nvalues  and  4  inclusion of Islamic faith components that are inspirational and relevant to \nthe lives of the women and their male gatekeepers  e g  husbands  brothers  and that will \ninfluence these men to understand the women’s needs and support them \n\nDeveloping a Culturally Competent Framework Using CBPR\nThe inclusion of community-based Islamic and cultural concepts fits well with the Afghan \nculture of collective identity and with Islamic views on health and well-being  It also \nprovides valuable guidelines for ensuring that any intervention is culturally specific by \n\nShirazi et al  Page 3\n\nJ Relig Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 February 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

Based Participatory Research  CBPR  principles  a Community \nAdvisory Board  CAB  was formed  composed of community leaders  healthcare providers  \nacademic research partners  a cultural consultant  community navigators  and women from \nthe community  The main goal of the CAB is to ensure the development of culturally \nappropriate cancer intervention programs  Israel  Eng  & Schuiz  2005  Meetings of the \nCAB are structured to help develop a partnership where there is equality of control and \nparticipation by the community and research partners \n\nTo ensure a shared understanding of both research and the CBPR approach  training sessions \nwere conducted by research scientists  These scientists trained community leaders on \nvarious aspects of research  and the community leaders provided feedback and cultural and \nreligious input emphasizing the key elements of conducting research in the community  \nCommunity leaders and CAB members were actively involved  and their views on cultural \nissues were incorporated into our framework \n\nIn designing a faith-based breast health education framework  we considered the women’s \npreferences for formats and how messages and information should be presented  Most \nimmigrant Afghan women are linguistically isolated in their homes  The women we \ninterviewed were enthusiastic about meeting in small groups  where information could be \nshared and passed on to other women through word of mouth  Family relationships in the \nAfghan culture and Muslim religion  however  were understood to be fundamental  In \naddition  men’s gatekeeping roles  together with the traditional understanding and \nexpectation of men as the heads of the household and caretakers of the family  often \ncontrolled women’s decisions about their healthcare needs  Many women commented that \nthese factors not only created communication barriers with healthcare providers  but also \ndecreased the women’s ability to make appropriate healthcare decisions  Therefore  the CAB \nrecommended providing an education program using cultural/religious values to reach male \nfamily members  Because of the sensitive nature of the educational information about \nwomen’s bodies  and out of respect for conservative Afghan cultural practices  members of \nthe CAB suggested that the educational sessions be conducted in gender-specific groups led \nby Health Advisors  HAs  of the same gender \n\nIn the discussion of the findings from the interviews  our CAB decided that the small group \neducational sessions should be interactive  with question-and-answer sessions and \nstorytelling in which breast cancer survivors might share their personal narratives with \nhopeful messages and perspectives  The literacy rate  even in their native Farsi/Dari or \nPashto  is very low—40% had no formal education—so participants expressed a strong \ndesire for educational resources  tools and formats with visual and oral components  these \nbeing perceived as most effective for learning about breast health  Videos or programs \nshown on Afghan TV and websites could also be incorporated into educational material \n\nThe CAB felt that  given the many comments from interviewees expressing the centrality of \nreligion  religious ideas including quotes from the Quran and Prophet Mohammed about the \nimportance of preserving one’s health should be incorporated in educational curricula for \nboth women and their male family members  Reinforcing Islamic teachings would not only \n\nShirazi et al  Page 4\n\nJ Relig Health  Author manuscript

relatives to understand the women’s \nneeds and support them \n\nIncorporating Islamic Concepts\nWe identified several Islamic concepts that can facilitate the framing of determinants for \nhealth and encourage positive healthcare behaviors among Afghan community members  \nThe element of Imaan  which means belief or faith  is the foundation on which the Islamic \nlifestyle is built  It highlights the importance of fellowship and community involvement and \nfosters an environment for social support by encouraging social organization  Da’waa \nliterally means “invitation ” inviting or calling people to know and learn about practices in \nreal life that are beneficial for their own and their community’s well-being  It applies to \nevery Muslim’s own family  relatives and friends  The main objective is to invite people to \nknow about and participate in the provision of basic needs for their community—such as \nfood  shelter  education and health care—through advocating for social justice  solidarity  a \npeaceful and safe environment  and healthy behavior  Taleem va Ta’alom  or the promotion \nof learning and teaching  is highly valued in Islamic culture because Islam considers \neducation to be a sacred duty for both men and women  Shura  or collaboration  is a basic \nIslamic principle that ensure that the views of the community are taken into consideration in \nall affairs and calls for transparency and accountability  The concept of Shura is also used to \nemphasize gender justice and equality in a variety of situations  such as interpersonal \nrelationships within the family and the community \n\nThese concepts provide a framework for family members and kin  who occupy the center of \nthe Islamic lifestyle  The incorporation of these four Islamic constructs in breast health \neducation can help the majority of community members toward a collaborative \nunderstanding of the purpose of community health programs and the roles and \nresponsibilities of both men and women in supporting the well-being of their families and \ncommunity \n\nConclusions\nBased on the results of the pilot study  we received strong support from the Afghan \ncommunity to address barriers to breast cancer screening  Guided by CBPR principles  a \nmulti-component intervention program has been developed by a team of academic and \ncommunity partners to address unmet needs of the Muslim Afghan community  The Afghan \nWomen’s Breast Health Project  AWBHP  a culturally appropriate  faith-based intervention \nprogram for Afghan immigrant women  has been awarded a 5-year grant from the National \nInstitute of Health  To the best of our knowledge  the AWBHP is the first study that has used \na faith-based CBPR approach to enhance breast cancer knowledge and screening among \nimmigrant Afghan women  This research represents a formative area of study with respect to \n 1  better understanding of role of community partners and  2  experience in faith-based \nhealth promotion research  which has received limited attention in the literature of public \nhealth  Specific emphases on cultural competency  community ownership  interdependence  \nand capacity building will be keys to success  Israel  et al  2001  Israel  et al  1998 \n\nShirazi et al  Page 5\n\nJ Relig Health  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 February 01 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the development and planning of the AWBHP involves much \nmore than just a Farsi/Dari translation of materials and messages  Rather  it consists of \ncollective strategies  culturally tailored for appropriateness and competency  The program \nrecognizes the importance of faith and spirituality in this community and  by incorporating \nIslamic components that are important and inspirational to the lives of participants  it \nreframes Islam as a facilitator of women’s health  Crucially  the AWBHP is geared towards \ndefining and delivering key Islamic messages that will promote breast health care among \nMuslim Afghan women \n\nAmerican Muslims are one minority group for whom a shared religious identity may have \nimportant health impacts that are independent of race  ethnicity  and socioeconomic status  \nNumbering between 5 and 7 million in the US  Muslims represent a growing minority \npopulation that is racially  ethnically  and socioeconomically diverse  Allied Media Corp  \n2000  A large proportion are immigrants from Islamic countries  Therefore  the framework \nwe propose may provide a template for reaching a wide range of Islamic communities in the \nUS by treating religious beliefs and their influence on health and healthcare-seeking \nbehavior as facilitators  and not merely as “cultural barriers ” At the conclusion of the five-\nyear intervention  the AWBHP will be evaluated and best practices and recommendations \nfor a faith based program to address breast cancer screening will be adopted  We anticipate \nthat if the program is successful  we will have a model for religious and culturally tailored \nevidenced-based education and breast cancer awareness programs for Muslim immigrant \nwomen  whether they speak Farsi/Dari  Afghan and Persian women  or other dialects/\nlanguages  The knowledge gained and the guidelines developed will have an impact that \nreaches far beyond the Afghan community in Northern California \n\nReferences\nAllied Media Corp  Muslim American Demographic

of targeted therapies has been\n\ndeveloped to pinpoint specific mutations in cancer [1  2]  For example  several\n\ndrugs have been developed that inhibit PI3K signaling  which is dysregulated in\n\ncancers of the breast  colon  and ovary  among others [3–6]  Some of these\n\ntargeted therapies can improve tumor perfusion  and hence  delivery of imaging\n\nagents such as FDG  while independently modifying intrinsic glucose demand [7] \n\nOn the other hand  highly angiogenic tumors or tumors with aberrant vascular\n\nsignaling may have limited capacity for nutrient or drug delivery [8]  The limited\n\ndelivery of FDG  for example  could lead to an incorrect perception that the\n\ntumor’s demand for glucose is low  It is therefore important to identify whether\n\nperceived changes in glucose uptake are caused by vascular or true glycolytic\n\nchanges \n\nClinically  immunohistochemistry  IHC  and 18-FDG Positron Emission\n\nTomography  PET  imaging are widely accepted methods for glucose imaging \n\nIHC can effectively quantify glucose transporters  GLUTs  in tumors [9]  but\n\nrequires labor-intensive ex vivo tissue processing and staining  PET imaging is\n\nanother invaluable clinical tool for measuring glucose uptake in tumors or\n\nmetastases [10–12]  PET offers necessary insight into tumor metabolism  but the\n\nmethod is not without limitations  for example  limited spatial resolution [13] and\n\nprohibitive cost \n\nAdditionally  both PET and IHC can inform on oxygenation properties of\n\ntissue  IHC can be used to quantify hypoxic fraction via staining with\n\nnitroimidazoles  e g  pimonidazole or EF5  [9  14  15]  but cannot provide kinetic\n\ninformation due to sample preparation  PET can report on both hypoxia and\n\nblood flow to further inform on the tumor microenvironment  PET hypoxia\n\nimaging with nitroimidazole compounds exhibit low tumor to background\n\ncontrast  however [16]  Additionally  either hypoxia or blood flow imaging with\n\nPET requires the use of additional tracers  further increasing the complexity and\n\ncost of the technique [17  18] \n\nLike FDG  the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG has been shown to serve as a\n\nmarker of glucose uptake in a variety of cell and animal models [19–24]  Uptake\n\nof 2-NBDG can be imaged using a host of optical imaging techniques  These same\n\noptical techniques can also be leveraged to measure tumor vascular blood flow\n\nand oxygenation without the use of exogenous tracers [25  26]  Our group has\n\ndeveloped an in vivo optical imaging strategy that utilizes a combination of 2-\n\nNBDG uptake and oxygenation to report on tumor metabolism [27]  We used our\n\nimaging strategy in a dorsal skin flap model of murine breast cancers and\n\nidentified four parameters that describe the tumor vasculature and uptake kinetics\n\nof 2-NBDG  vascular oxygenation  SO2  rate of delivery of 2-NBDG  RD  rate of\n\nclearance of 2-NBDG  RC  and glucose uptake  2-NBDG60  We used these\n\nparameters to demonstrate that the delivery kinetics of 2-NBDG in vivo have\n\nprofound effects on uptake and  in turn  perceived glycolytic demand  Several\n\ngroups have demonstrated a similar phenomenon with FDG-PET  showing that\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 2 / 20\n\n\n\nknowledge of blood flow is crucial to interpreting FDG-PET based glucose uptake\n\n[18  28]  For example  Specht and colleagues showed that using the ratio of the\n\nmetabolic rate of FDG  MRFDG  to blood flow as a surrogate for metabolism was\n\na better indicator of long-term fate than using MRFDG alone [28] \n\nLikewise  we sought here to demonstrate that correcting uptake of 2-NBDG \n\nNBDG60  by the rate of delivery  RD  showed improved contrast between distinct\n\ntumor phenotypes  The first aim of the current study was to demonstrate that the\n\nratio 2-NBDG60/RD serves as a delivery-corrected measure of glucose uptake in\n\nmurine dorsal skin flap window chamber models containing normal tissues and\n\ntumors  Importantly  the ratio was able to distinguish specific uptake of 2-NBDG\n\nfrom accumulation of a fluorescent control  2-NBDLG  which is identical to 2-\n\nNBDG in molecular weight and fluorescent spectrum  but is unable to undergo\n\nactive transport into the cell [29]  The ratio 2-NBDG60/RD was then leveraged to\n\ncompare different tumor phenotypes and to characterize the dependence of\n\nglucose uptake on vascular oxygenation within these tumors  Our results showed\n\nthat 2-NBDG60/RD was an effective endpoint for comparing in vivo glucose uptake\n\nof metastatic 4T1 and nonmetastatic 4T07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas\n\nderived from the same spontaneous parental tumor [30]  Further  the addition of\n\nvascular information revealed metabolic heterogeneity within the tumors  The\n\nresults presented here indicate that optical imaging of 2-NBDG/RD and vascular\n\nendpoints can reveal interesting and distinct phenotypes in normal tissue and\n\ntumors \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture Maintenance and Seahorse Assay\n\nTwo murine mammary carcinoma cell lines  4T1 and 4T07  were used in this\n\nstudy  Though arising from the same tumor  the cell lines have distinct different\n\nmetastatic potential [31]  4T1 cells have been shown to metastasize throughout\n\nthe body to organs such as the lung  liver  bone and brain  4T07 is able to seed\n\ninto the lung and liver but it fails to engraft to form metastatic nodules  Both cell\n\nlines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium  DMEM  Gibco \n\nCarlsbad  California  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%\n\nantibiotics and kept free from contaminants  Cells were passaged every 2–3 days\n\nand kept incubated at 37 0 C˚ and 5 0% O2 \n\nA Seahorse Glycolytic Stress Test [Seahorse Biosciences  Massachusetts  USA]\n\nwas used to measure the metabolic properties of 4T1 and 4T07 cells  Oxygen\n\nconsumption rate  OCR  and extracellular acidification rate  ECAR  were\n\nmeasured every 11 minutes  OCR was calculated based on changes in dissolved\n\noxygen in the cell media and ECAR was calculated based on detection of changes\n\nin free proton concentration in the cell media  Between minute 22 and minute 33\n\nof the assay  25 mM glucose was injected to each well  Between minute 55 and\n\nminute 66  1 uM oligomycin was injected to each well  Oligomycin inhibits\n\noxygen

different days and each assay contained 4 replicate wells of each\n\ncell line \n\nDorsal Window Chamber Implantation\n\nAll animal work was performed according to the recommendations of the

Number  A170-12-06  Female nu/nu athymic mice  NCI \n\nFrederic  Maryland  8–10 weeks old and weighing between 20–25 g  were used for\n\nall in vivo studies  Murine dorsal window chambers were implanted according to\n\nthe sterile procedure detailed by Palmer [33]  Briefly  mice were anesthetized via\n\ni p  administration of ketamine  100 mg/kg  and xylazine  10 mg/kg  and\n\nimplanted

dorsal chamber to cover the exposed tissue  Animals were housed\n\non-site at Duke University under standard 12-hour light/dark cycles  During\n\nhousing  all animals were provided ad libitum access to food and water \n\nImaging Platform\n\nOur imaging system and procedure have both been described in detail [27  34]  A\n\nZeiss Axioskop 2 microscope fitted with a 2 5x objective  NA50 075  was used for\n\nboth trans-illumination vascular imaging and epi-illumination fluorescence  2-\n\nNBDG  imaging  A liquid crystal tunable filter  LCTF  was used for hyperspectral\n\nimaging  and a DVC 1412 CCD camera  DVC Company  recorded all images \n\nHyperspectral imaging was used for all 2-NBDG  2-NBDLG  and SO2 imaging \n\nTrans-illumination images were acquired from 520 to 620 nm in 10 nm\n\nincrements and used to calculate SO2  A 470 nm bandpass excitation filter  40 nm\n\nbandwidth  was used for 2-NBDG/2-NBDLG imaging  with a collection\n\nwavelength of 525 nm  10 nm bandwidth  Flow imaging was performed using a\n\nZeiss Axio Observer microscope fitted with a broad-spectrum halogen source \n\nDiscrete red blood cells were imaged through a 5x objective  Zeiss FLUAR  0

the integration time used for imaging  The average pixel\n\nintensity of the corresponding rhodamine image was then used to linearly scale 2-\n\nNBDG and 2-NBDLG images \n\nImaging Procedure\n\nDuring the 6-hour period prior to imaging  animals were fasted but allowed access\n\nto water  Immediately before imaging  blood glucose was measured from the tail\n\nvein using a FreeStyle Lite Blood Glucose Meter  Abbott Laboratories  Illinois \n\nUSA  Mice were then anesthetized with 2% v/v isoflurane mixed with air  which\n\nwas reduced to 1–1 5% v/v isoflurane for maintenance  The mouse was kept on a\n\nheated stage for the duration of imaging  Prior to 2-NBDG injection trans-\n\nillumination images were recorded for vascular characterization  Background\n\nfluorescence images corresponding to endogenous fluorescence from cellular FAD\n\nand stromal collagen at 525 nm were also recorded prior to injection [35]  A\n\n100 mL injection of 6 mM 2-NBDLG  6 mM 2-NBDG  or 10 mM 2-NBDG in\n\nsterile saline was then administered via tail vein  Fluorescence from the tracer was\n\nrecorded for 60 minutes  continuously for the first 10 minutes  every 30 seconds\n\nfor the next 30 minutes and every 3 minutes for the final 20 minutes of imaging \n\nFor the hyperemia study  which was conducted to extend the range of red blood\n\ncell velocities  mice were subjected to an hour of breathing hypoxic gas  10% O2 \n\nbalance N2  and then allowed to breathe room air for 10 minutes  Imaging began\n\nimmediately following the 10-minute reoxygenation period using the imaging\n\nprotocol described above  Mice receiving two perturbations  6 mM and 10 mM \n\n2-NBDG and 2-NBDLG  or baseline and post-hypoxia imaging  were imaged on\n\ntwo consecutive days to allow for 2-NBDG clearance and ample recovery from\n\nanesthesia  At the completion of imaging  mice were euthanized by injectable\n\neuthanizing agent  Euthasol  Virbac  USA  0 05 mL via i p  injection  in\n\naccordance with a protocol approved by The Duke University Institutional\n\nAnimal Care and Use Committee  An overview of methods is shown in Fig  1 \n\nCalculation of Vascular and Metabolic Parameters\n\nTrans-illumination images were collected in 10 nm increments from 500–600 nm\n\nand used to create an image cube  x y l  Our procedure was previously described\n\nin detail [27]  A modified form of the Beer-Lambert law uses the extinction\n\ncoefficients of [HbO2] and [dHb] to calculate the concentrations of each absorber\n\nat each pixel  We then calculate total hemoglobin content  [THb]\n\n [HbO2]+[dHb]  and SO2  [HbO2]/[THb]  at each pixel  The presence or\nabsence of [THb] was used to segment the images into vascular and tissue space \n\nrespectively \n\nAfter 2-NBDG injection  fluorescence images were collected  for a period of\n\n75 minutes  A kinetic uptake curve was created from the  x y t  data for each  x y \n\npixel location  As shown in Fig  1  the initial rate of delivery  RD  and glucose\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 5 / 20\n\n\n\nuptake  2-NBDG60  were calculated from the time course for each pixel  RD was\n\ncalculated from the rise to the initial peak of the curve as  Imax-I0 /Tmax  where\n\nsubscript 0 corresponds to a baseline image captured prior to 2-NBDG injection \n\n2-NBDG60 is defined as glucose uptake  We showed previously that 2-NBDG\n\nfluorescence at 60 minutes is confined to the intercellular space [27] \n\nFor 4T1 and 4T07 tumors  each endpoint  2-NBDG60  RD  2-NBDG60/RD  was\n\nadditionally parsed by SO2  For each 2-NBDG60  RD  or 2-NBDG60/RD image \n\nevery tissue pixel in the tumor area was assigned to an SO2 group according to the\n\nSO2 of the nearest vascular pixel  In a given image  there were as many as five SO2\n\nFig  1  Outline of methods   A  Timeline of imaging events  Mice that were imaged under two imaging conditions were imaged on subsequent days  The\norder of imaging was scrambled to minimize order effects   B  A 6 mM injection of 2-NBDG was given and imaged for at least 60 minutes  and the

perturbation group  Each mouse was used for up to two\nimaging sessions  with 24 hours between sessions  The groups were randomized to minimize bias from imaging order  and an analysis of variance

pixels for each endpoint was then represented as a survival\n\ncurve  1-cumulative distribution  stratified by SO2  Curves were then averaged\n\nwithin a tumor type  4T1 or 4T07  Each curve then represents the mean of\n\ndistributions of 2-NBDG60  RD  or 2-NBDG60/RD pixels at a given SO2 level from\n\nup to 8 mice \n\nThe blood flow imaging procedure has previously been described in detail [26] \n\nIn short  a video of individual red blood cells flowing through vessels in a non-\n\ntumor bearing window chamber was collected  taking advantage of the absorption\n\nproperties of hemoglobin  A cross-correlation was performed between subsequent\n\nframes to track red blood cell movement  For each mouse  we calculated both\n\nblood velocity and 2-NBDG delivery  RD  in the image region surrounding the\n\nvessel with the fastest blood velocity  This allowed us to achieve a wide range of\n\nblood velocities over which to correlate blood velocity with RD  For a given\n\nmouse  the same region was selected in corresponding blood velocity and 2-\n\nNBDG images  and kept consistent between days \n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nSeahorse assay results were compared with unpaired student’s t-tests  Results\n\nshowing 6 mM and 10 mM doses of 2-NBDG  kinetics at baseline and after\n\nhypoxia  or endpoints from 2-NBDG and 2-NBDLG imaging were compared\n\nusing a student’s paired t-test  Each paired test corresponds to the same cohort of\n\nmice being imaged on consecutive days under two different imaging parameters \n\nImaging order was scrambled in all studies- for example  half the mice received\n\n6 mM 2-NBDG on day 1 and 10 mM 2-NBDG on day 2  and half received 10 mM\n\n2-NBDG on day 1 and 6 mM 2-NBDG on day 2  Correlations between parameters\n\nwere determined by Pearson’s linear correlation  For tumor studies containing\n\nmultiple groups  a one-way analysis of variance  ANOVA  was performed to test\n\nfor global differences and a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test was used to compare\n\nbetween groups  Survival curves were compared using repeated measures\n\nANOVA  For all analyses  differences between groups were deemed significant at a\n\n95% confidence level  p#0 05  The Statistics Toolbox in MATLAB  MathWorks \n\nUSA  was used for all statistical tests \n\nResults\n\nDelivery-corrected 2-NBDG-uptake inversely correlates with blood\nglucose concentration\n\nFig  2

indistinguishable from normal tissue  not shown \n\nDiscussion\n\nPreviously  our group determined that the in vivo rate of 2-NBDG delivery has\n\nsignificant effects on the uptake of 2-NBDG  and as a result  the perceived glucose\n\nuptake of the tissue [27]  We have here presented a method of utilizing the kinetic\n\nprofile of 2-NBDG uptake to correct for variations in delivery and uncover more\n\naccurately the glycolytic uptake in vivo  To validate our method of delivery\n\ncorrection  we first showed that the rate of delivery was significantly correlated\n\nwith delivery-linked variables  Varying the injected concentration of 2-NBDG\n\nfrom 6 mM to 10 mM was sufficient to cause an increase in the rate of delivery \n\ndue to an increased 2-NBDG fluorescence at 5-minutes after injection  Upon\n\nfurther investigation of the 6 mM and 10 mM cohorts  we found that there was\n\nno difference in Tmax between groups  p50 50  not shown  The difference in RD\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 14 / 20\n\n\n\nwas explained by a difference in the intensity 2-NBDGmax between groups  which\n\nwas expected to vary with injected dose \n\nWe further wished to show that RD varies with variations in the time of\n\ndelivery  Hypoxia has been shown to increase red blood cell velocity in normal\n\ntissue  for example rat brain [38]  which we hypothesized would cause a resulting\n\nincrease in the delivery speed of 2-NBDG  The injected concentration of 2-NBDG\n\nwas kept constant at 6 mM to avoid confounding effects  We found that one hour\n\nof breathing hypoxic gas  10% O2  balance N2  followed by 10 minutes of\n\nbreathing room air was sufficient to increase the velocity of red blood cells in\n\nnormal  non-tumor  vasculature  As hypothesized  we saw a corresponding\n\nincrease in the rate of 2-NBDG delivery  Prior to hypoxia  the range of blood flow\n\nvelocities was not sufficient to obtain a wide range of 2-NBDG delivery rates \n\nHyperemia significantly increased the blood velocity range allowing for an\n\nimproved correlation with RD  R50 87  p 0 05  This is not surprising because\nmetabolic substrate delivery is tightly correlated to demand in normal tissue\n\n[39  40] and glucose demand is increased by hypoxia [41] \n\nTo investigate whether correction for delivery effects altered the relationship\n\nbetween glucose and 2-NBDG  we calculated the correlations between 2-NBDG60\nand blood glucose concentration and between 2-NBDG60/RD and blood glucose\n\nconcentration  A moderate inverse correlation was seen between 2-NBDG60/RD\nand blood glucose concentration  R520 61  p50 02  as well as between 2-\nNBDG60 and blood glucose concentration  R520 52  p50 05  not shown \nindicating that 2-NBDG competition with blood glucose is real  and not an\n\nartifact of delivery correction  The trends we observed are consistent with in vitro\n\nstudies of oral neoplasia showing that 2-NBDG uptake is competitively inhibited\n\nby glucose  and 2-NBDG fluorescence decreases with increasing glucose\n\nconcentration [19]  Further  2-NBDG uptake has been shown to increase with an\n\nincrease in glucose demand  For example  Sheth and colleagues showed in vivo\n\nthat 2-NBDG uptake in the brain increases greatly during a seizure  a well-\n\nestablished instance of increased glucose demand [23]  In accordance with these\n\nfindings  we now show that blood glucose competes with 2-NBDG in vivo  and\n\ncaution that major variations in blood glucose may change the interpretation of 2-\n\nNBDG data \n\nWe then asked if 2-NBDG60/RD was capable of distinguishing between\n\ncontrolled instances of varied tracer uptake in vivo  We used 2-NBDG in\n\nunperturbed normal tissue in vivo  taking advantage of the baseline level of\n\nglucose demand  To simulate a contrasting situation of negligible demand in vivo \n\nwe used the fluorescent molecule 2-NBDLG  which has been developed for use as\n\na 2-NBDG control substance [29]  Though identical in molecular weight and\n\nfluorescent spectrum to 2-NBDG  2-NBDLG is unrecognized by the GLUT\n\nreceptors and cannot be actively transported into the cell  Instead  2-NBDLG\n\nfluorescence may represent non-specific adsorption onto the cell membrane or\n\nuptake through damaged membrane [29]  2-NBDLG fluorescence may also\n\ncorrespond to tracer accumulation in the interstitial space  though we have shown\n\nthat the specific probe 2-NBDG clears the interstitial space by 60 minutes after\n\nImaging of Fluorescently-Labeled Glucose in Breast Cancers\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115529 December 19  2014 15 / 20\n\n\n\ninjection [27]  We hypothesized that  for a given animal  uptake of 2-NBDG\n\nwould exceed uptake of 2-NBDLG  Interestingly  2-NBDG and 2-NBDLG\n\nfluorescence intensities at 60 minutes were indistinguishable in each animal  In a\n\nseparate experiment  we found that the average fluorescent intensity of 100 nM 2-\n\nNBDLG in solution was approximately 25% greater than the fluorescent intensity\n\nof 100 nM 2-NBDG  data not shown  indicating a greater fluorescence quantum\n\nyield for the control solution  We caution that care must be taken to properly\n\ncalibrate for differences in fluorescent behavior when using a control marker for\n\n2-NBDG in vitro or in vivo  Our results showed that our correction by RD was able\n\nto account for the difference in fluorescence intensity between 2-NBDLG and\n\n2-NBDG  After correcting for a greater max intensity of 2-NBDLG  2-NBDG\n\naccumulation was approximately 3-fold higher than 2-NBDLG accumulation in\n\nall animals  indicating that we were able to identify stereo-specific uptake \n\nSince metabolic substrate delivery is tightly controlled in normal tissue [39  40] \n\nexternal perturbations were needed to observe significant changes in delivery and\n\ndemand  This allowed us to validate our method in a controlled way  However \n\nour ultimate goal was to utilize our strategy to characterize tumors  where delivery\n\nand demand may be ‘‘mis-matched’’  Using PET to find discrepancies between\n\nblood flow and FDG delivery has proven useful for characterizing disease in heart\n\nand brain tissue [42  43]  Specht  et al  were among the first to use functional\n\nimaging to uncover an altered relationship between tumor metabolism and blood\n\nflow that existed in breast cancer subtypes [28]  We  too  hypothesized that our\n\nmethod correlated to the long-term fate of different tumor subtypes- in particular \n\nmetastatic potential  As previously mentioned  4T1 is a metastatic murine\n\nmammary tumor line  and 4T07 is a non-metastatic sister murine mammary\n\ntumor line [30  31]  An assessment of 2-NBDG60/RD values averaged over the\n\nentire tumor regions revealed that glycolytic uptake of the 4T1 tumors far\n\nexceeded that of 4T07 tumors  as shown by our previous results [27] and now\n\ncorroborated by a Seahorse assay \n\nWe additionally showed that these differences are not due to differences in\n\noxygenation  as average SO2  vascular density and oxygen consumption rate were\n\ncomparable between 4T1 and 4T07 tumors  Our in vivo and Seahorse in vitro\n\nresults are consistent with previous work showing that lactate concentration in\n\ntumors both fuels tumor growth and is predictive of metastasis [44–47]  Recently \n\nSonveaux et  al have proposed a mechanism which may underlie the association\n\nbetween lactate and tumor aggressiveness  They showed that lactate upregulates\n\nHIF-1 in endothelial cells  and that blocking lactate entry through monocarbox-\n\nylate transporter 1 can prevent endothelial migration and tumor angiogenesis\n\n[48] \n\nLastly  we wanted to investigate regional trends in 2-NBDG uptake  as it is well\n\nestablished that the tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous with\n\nrespect to oxygenation [36  37  49]  For example  vascular remodeling in tumors\n\nleads to areas of decreased oxygen delivery to the cells  Studies in window\n\nchambers have shown that tumor tissue can approach anoxia as close as 100 um\n\nfrom a vessel [50]  However  cells are often able to compensate by increasing\n\nImaging of

uptake\n\nto increase as SO2 decreases  A combination of low 2-NBDG uptake and low SO2 \n\nhowever  may indicate non-viable cells chronically starved of both glucose and\n\noxygen [51  52]  Modeling has shown that glucose diffuses farther than oxygen\n\n[53] and that glucose concentration decreases only slightly over a distance of  30\ncells from a vessel [54]  We excluded pixels farther than 150 mm from a vessel to\nensure that non-viable cells were not mischaracterized \n\nInterestingly  we observed in 4T1 that 2-NBDG60 uptake was lowest in regions\n\nof very low oxygenation  Looking at RD reveals that diminished delivery\n\ncontributes to low levels of 2-NBDG uptake in hypoxic regions  After correcting\n\nfor decreased delivery to viable cells  the poorly oxygenated 4T1 regions showed\n\nelevated 2-NBDG60/RD compared to tumor’s well-oxygenated regions  On the\n\nother hand  4T07 tumors did not exhibit hypoxic regions nor regions of poor 2-\n\nNBDG delivery  As in 4T1 tumors  2-NBDG60/RD increased significantly as\n\nvascular oxygenation decreased in 4T07 \n\nIn addition to sustaining the highest 2-NBDG60 at all oxygenation levels  the\n\n4T1 tumors also had lower RD than 4T07 tumors or normal tissue  For our\n\ndataset  a lower RD corresponded to a longer 2-NBDG delivery time-to-max \n\nindicating impeded delivery  mean Tmax 4T1510 88 min  mean\nTmax 4T0757 20 min  mean Tmax norm54 42 min  Tumors often have impeded\ndelivery of nutrients due to the immature and tortuous vessels created by\n\nangiogenesis [37]  Interestingly  some tumors with long capillary transport times\n\nadapt by upregulating aerobic glycolysis [55]  This type of Warburgian\n\nmetabolism would be consistent with our findings for 4T1  which had sustained\n\nhigh glucose uptake across oxygen levels \n\nAs a last consideration  it is important to note that our strategy may be\n\nparticularly effective in regions of poor delivery  identified by slow blood velocity\n\nor hypoxia  Mankoff and colleagues have demonstrated with FDG-PET that a\n\nmismatch between tumor metabolism and blood flow  in particular high\n\nmetabolic rate relative to blood flow  is an indicator of poor prognosis in tumors\n\n[56]  For this reason  we have developed our method to help us quickly identify\n\ntumor regions with poor delivery but sustained 2-NBDG uptake  Additionally \n\nhypoxia is an indicator of poor prognosis in regard to treatment response \n\nrecurrence  and overall outcome [57–59]  so the ability to identify hypoxic tumor\n\nregions is crucial  With further development  our method of imaging delivery-\n\ncorrected 2-NBDG uptake and oxygenation is well-poised as a tool for pre-clinical\n\nand clinical tumor characterization \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to

unclear  In this study  we used a meta-analysis of two prognostic GWAs and a\nreplication cohort to identify the strongest associations and to evaluate the loci suggested in previous studies  We attempt\nto identify those SNPs which could impact overall survival irrespective of the age of onset \n\nMethods  To facilitate the meta-analysis and to refine the association signals  SNPs were imputed using data from the 1000\ngenomes project  Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios  HR  in 536 patients from the POSH\ncohort  Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer  and 805 patients from the HEBCS\ncohort  Helsinki Breast Cancer Study  These hazard ratios were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects meta-\nanalysis and a p-value threshold of 561028 was used to determine significance  Replication was performed in 1523\nadditional patients from the POSH study \n\nResults  Although no SNPs achieved genome wide significance  three SNPs have significant association in the replication\ncohort and combined p-values less than 5 661026  These SNPs are  rs421379 which is 556 kb upstream of ARRDC3\n HR = 1 49  95% confidence interval  CI  = 1 27–1 75  P = 1 161026  rs12358475 which is between ECHDC3 and PROSER2\n HR = 0 75  CI = 0 67–0 85  P = 1 861026  and rs1728400 which is between LINC00917 and FOXF1 \n\nConclusions  In a genome wide meta-analysis of two independent cohorts from UK and Finland  we identified potential\nassociations at three distinct loci  Phenotypic heterogeneity and relatively small sample sizes may explain the lack of\ngenome wide significant findings  However  the replication at three SNPs in the validation cohort shows promise for future\nstudies in larger cohorts  We did not find strong evidence for concordance between the few associations highlighted by\nprevious GWAs of breast cancer survival and this study \n\nCitation  Rafiq S  Khan S  Tapper W  Collins A

cases per 100 000  it remains the\n\nmost common cancer in the UK and accounts for 31% of new\n\ncancer cases in women  The latest age-standardised survival rate\n\nfor breast cancer in England is predicted to be 85% at 5 years \n\nfalling to 65% at 20 years [1]  Traditionally prognostic informa-\n\ntion is derived from tumour phenotypic characteristics including\n\ntumour size  stage  and grade  These tumour phenotypes and\n\ncancer cell surface receptors such as oestrogen receptor  ER  and\n\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER2  are also used\n\nto guide treatment  Although the breast cancer survival rate has\n\nPLOS ONE | www plosone org 1 December 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 12 | e101488\n\n\n\n\n\nimproved  the response to treatment and longevity of patients is\n\noften unpredictable even between those with similar tumours and\n\ngeneral health  More recently tumour genomic profiling experi-\n\nments have suggested cancer molecular signatures may give more\n\naccurate prognostic information [2–4]  These signatures may\n\npredict outcome better than conventional histopathology based\n\nrisk algorithms but are not in routine clinical use [5] \n\nFamilial studies suggest a genetic component for breast cancer\n\nprognosis [6 7]  The familial contribution to prognosis may arise\n\nas a result of the background genotype affecting acquired tumour\n\ncharacteristics which influence prognosis  Indeed high penetrance\n\npredisposition genes which lead to the consistent development of\n\nspecific breast tumour sub-types have been identified [8 9]  Low\n\npenetrance risk SNPs tend to be associated with either ER positive\n\nor ER negative breast cancer but often not both [10–14]  In\n\naddition there may be pharmacogenomic effects of background\n\ngenotype on response to cancer treatment  It is anticipated that\n\ngenome wide association studies  GWAs  with sufficient sample\n\nsize and genetic coverage may lead to novel insights into common\n\ninherited genetic variants which influence prognosis \n\nIn the past few years several GWAs of breast cancer survival\n\nhave been reported  These studies have had limited success and\n\nnone of them have identified variants that are associated at\n\ngenome wide levels of significance [15–19]  While small sample\n\nsizes are likely to be of one of the main factors responsible for the\n\nmodest levels of significance and lack of concordance between the\n\nGWAs  small effect sizes  incomplete genetic coverage  and\n\nphenotypic heterogeneity could also contribute and need to be\n\naddressed \n\nIn this study  we used a meta-analysis to combine evidence from\n\ntwo GWAs consisting of 536 patients from the POSH cohort\n\n Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary\n\nbreast cancer  and 805 patients from the HEBCS cohort  Helsinki\n\nBreast Cancer Study  A further 1523 patients from the POSH\n\ncohort were used to validate the most significant SNPs  With a\n\ncombined sample size of 2864 participants  this analysis has 81%\n\npower to detect effects of modest sizes  HR$1 25  p = 0 05  and\nwith relatively rare SNPs  MAF=10%  The cohorts used in this\n\nanalysis have a high incidence of breast cancer related mortality\n\nand well documented tumour and treatment data which make\n\nthem ideal for the purpose of exploring genetic factors influencing\n\nprognosis  In addition  these cohorts are similar in terms of their\n\npatient recruitment from regional medical centres  duration of\n\nprospective follow-up  and documentation of breast cancer related\n\nmortality \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAll participants from POSH and Helsinki gave written informed\n\nconsent  all were female  The POSH study received approval from\n\nthe South and West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee\n\n MREC 00/6/69  The Helsinki breast cancer study received\n\napproval from the Ethical Committee of the Departments of\n\nOncology and Obstetrics and Gynaecology  Helsinki University\n\nCentral Hospital \n\nBreast cancer patients and genotyping\nBreast cancer cases were selected from the POSH study and the\n\nHelsinki breast cancer family Study  HEBCS  POSH study\n\nparticipants were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and were\n\naged forty or younger at diagnosis  the mean age at diagnosis in\n\nthis cohort is 36 years  Recruitments to the POSH cohort were\n\nmade between January 2000 and January 2008 from oncology\n\nclinics across the UK and the majority  98%  of patients presented\n\nsymptomatically  The recruitment  data collection and follow up\n\nprocedures for the POSH study participants are described in detail\n\nelsewhere [20] \n\nThe HEBCS samples were collected in Helsinki  Finland and\n\nare representative of breast cancer case series at the recruitment\n\ncentre during the collection periods  unselected sporadic and\n\nfamilial cases collected between 1997 and 2004  All of the cases\n\nused in the meta-analysis had histopathological and survival data \n\nDetailed information on the patient series and data collection has\n\npreviously been published [21]  The mean age at diagnosis was\n\n56 8 years \n\nStage 1 discovery dataset\nIn stage-1  574 participants from the POSH study were selected\n\nfor the discovery phase of the analysis aimed at hypothesis\n\ngeneration [20]  In keeping with a recent GWAS which identified\n\nfive new breast cancer susceptibility loci by enriching cases by\n\nrecruiting individuals with family history of breast cancer [22] \n\nTable 1

selection of triple negative cases genotyped\n\nin a collaboration aimed at risk associated SNPs in triple negative\n\nbreast cancer [11] and a second group enriched for exceptionally\n\nshort survival genotyped as described previously [23]  We\n\nobserved 236 breast cancer specific deaths in the POSH discovery\n\nset patients \n\nIn HEBCS  805 cases were selected from the patient series\n\ndescribed earlier [22]  including 423 unselected cases collected\n\nbetween years 1997 and 2000 as well as 140 cases collected\n\nbetween years 2001 and 2004  with 242 additional familial cases \n\nThe GWAS series was specifically enriched for cases with reduced\n\nsurvival  in the form of distant metastasis or death at the time of\n\nthe initiation of the study in 2008  resulting in 301 breast cancer\n\nspecific deaths at the time of analysis \n\nStage-2 replication Samples\nA further 1523 breast cancer patients from the POSH study\n\n[20] unselected for any survival differential were used for\n\nreplication in stage-2  At stage 2  there were 293 breast cancer\n\nspecific deaths \n\nGenome wide genotyping\nGenotyping of 574 POSH phase-1 breast cancer cases was\n\nconducted using the Illumina 660-Quad SNP array  Genotyping\n\nwas conducted in two separate batches at two locations  The Mayo\n\nClinic  Rochester  Minnesota  USA  genotyped 274 triple negative\n\nbreast cancers  negative for ER  PR and HER2  [11]  The\n\nremaining 300 POSH patients were genotyped at the Genome\n\nInstitute of Singapore  GIS  National University of Singapore \n\nthese were selected based on either short duration of breast cancer\n\nspecific survival  2 years  or long duration of breast cancer\nspecific survival  4 years  In order to ensure complete\nharmonisation of genotype calling  the intensity data from GIS\n\nand MAYO were combined and the genotyping module of\n\nIllumina’s Genome Studio software was used to generate\n\ngenotypes  A GenCall threshold of 0 15 was selected and the\n\nHumanHap660 annotation file was used  Of the 300 samples\n\ngenotyped in Singapore  3 were excluded from analysis because\n\nthey had sample call rates lower than 95%  No individuals among\n\nthe two hundred and seventy four triple negative cohort genotyped\n\nat the Mayo clinic were excluded from analysis based on poor call\n\nrate  The genotyping accuracy for SNPs genotyped by GIS and\n\nMayo were over 99% \n\nGenotyping of the HEBCS samples was conducted using the\n\nIllumina 550 platform as previously described [24]  SNP quality\n\ncontrol  QC  measures were implemented using Plink  The initial\n\nsample size of 832 was reduced to 805  following quality control\n\nmeasures to remove patients with  unidentified affectation status\n\nand gender discordance

Helsinki\n\nwhose genotypes did not concur with a European ancestry \n\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used GenABEL [26] in R 2 14 0 environment to perform\n\nsurvival analysis using post-QC genome wide SNP data  Follow-up\n\ntime was calculated as the difference between the date of diagnosis\n\nof breast cancer and the date of death due to breast cancer or the\n\ndate of last follow-up if still alive and right-censored at 10 years \n\nDistant disease free interval was calculated as the time from\n\ndiagnosis to occurrence of metastasis  We excluded patients with\n\ncontralateral or ipsilateral cancers for testing association with\n\ndistant disease free interval  All the Cox-proportional hazard\n\nmodels were adjusted for ER-status  Kaplan-Meier plots were\n\ngenerated using STATA v11 0 and IBM SPSS statistics 19 \n\nMantel-Haenszel Fixed effects meta-analysis was performed using\n\nthe metan module in STATA v11 0 [27]  For multivariate models\n\nwe used ER-status  metastasis stage  0 or

used to\n\ndetect heterogeneity in association estimates between POSH and\n\nHEBCS  Genome wide meta-analysis was performed using\n\nMetABEL [28] \n\nGenome wide imputation and meta-analysis\nWe imputed genome wide SNP information in POSH and\n\nHEBCS based on European phase 1 and release version 3\n\nhaplotypes  The reference haplotypes are derived from the 1000\n\ngenomes project which is the most comprehensive catalogue of\n\nhuman genetic variation including SNP  Indels and CNVs \n\nQuality control measures applied to imputed data included\n\nexcluding SNPs with HWE p-value 161026  MAF  5%  and\n\ngenotyping call rate  90% and individuals call rate  90% \nGenome wide survival analysis of imputed information was\n\nperformed in R-2 14 0 using GenABEL  Meta-analysis of results\n\nfrom GenABEL was performed using MetABEL  For imputing\n\ndata we used MACH  http //www sph umich edu/csg/abecasis/\n\nMACH/index html  We used VCFtools - v0 1 9 0 to generate\n\nplink

reference haplotypes for imputation analysis \n\nManhattan and Regional plots\nManhattan and QQ-plots were generated in R using the plot\n\ncommand  Regional plots were generated using LocusZoom [29] \n\nSample size calculations\nSample size calculations were performed in R 2 14 2 using\n\nsurvSNP package  The event rate used for power calculations was\n\n0 29 and a two-sided alpha of 0 05 was applied \n\nGene Expression variation by SNP\nWe used Genevar 3 2 0 to study variation in expression levels by\n\nSNP genotypes available from the MuTHER pilot project while\n\nusing NCBI Build 36 Ensembl 54 as reference [30]  Twin pairs\n\nwere divided into two groups of unrelated individuals  Expression\n\ndata from Lymphoblastoid cell lines are reported here  In addition\n\nwe used SNP and

\n\nResults\n\nPOSH stage-1 and HEBCS meta-analysis\nGenome wide genotype data were available from 536Caucasian\n\nparticipants of the POSH study and 805 Caucasian participants of\n\nthe HEBCS study  A total of 475 141 SNPs with observed\n\ngenotypes were available for meta-analysis in both the studies after\n\nexcluding SNPs based on QC criteria  In stage-1 we used fixed-\n\neffects meta-analysis to pool hazard ratio estimates from the 536\n\nPOSH and 805 Helsinki breast cancer patients  Table 1  In the\n\ntwo study meta-analysis we found five SNPs which were associated\n\nat p-values lower than 9 961026  Table 2  Figure 1  The 25 most\nassociated loci were selected for replication in POSH stage-2\n\npatients  For loci with more than one SNP associated with survival \n\nthe most significant SNP and any other SNP s  from the same\n\nlocus which were not in high LD with the lead SNP  r2 0 6  were\nselected for follow up in stage-2  Table 3 \n\nReplication testing in POSH stage-2 samples\nA total of 18 SNPs with independent association signals were\n\ntested for replication in POSH stage-2 validation samples\n\n n = 1523  One SNP demonstrated high duplicate error rate  \n8%  and was excluded from analysis  Of the 18 SNPs which were\n\nformally tested for replication  two demonstrated replication\n\nsignals in the validation cohort  Nine of the eighteen SNPs which\n\nwere tested for replication were observed to be associated in the\n\nsame direction as in the POSH and HEBCS meta-analysis  In the\n\nstage-1 and stage-2 meta-analysis the strongest association signal\n\nwas observed at rs421379  The minor allele of rs421379 is found\n\nto be associated with a higher risk of breast cancer related death\n\n HR  95% CI  = 1 49  1 27–1 75  p = 1 161026   Figure 2  The p-\nvalue for Cochran’s heterogeneity test Q-statistic was not\n\nindicative of heterogeneity in meta-analysis estimate  p = 0 09 \n\nThis variant was previously identified as the most significantly\n\nassociated variant in a two stage GWAs for breast cancer survival\n\nin early onset cases from POSH  A weak replication signal in\n\nHEBCS allowed this SNP to be identified as the most strongly\n\nassociated variant in this study too  Figure 2  The second most\n\nsignificant variant was located at 10p14  where the minor allele of\n\nrs12358475 was associated with protective effect on breast cancer\n\nmortality  HR  95% CI  = 0 75  0 67–0 75  p = 1 861026 \n Figure 3  We observed another strong association with\n\nrs1728400 which is 113 6 kb upstream of the FOXF1 locus\n Table 3  In addition  the three SNPs  rs421379  rs12358475 and\n\nrs1728400  were also associated with distant disease free survival in\n\nthe same direction as those observed for overall survival times \n\nalthough none of these reached a genome wide level of significance\n\n Table 4 \n\nGenome wide imputation and meta-analysis\nFollowing quality control of imputed data we had 7105428\n\nSNPs available  maf $5%  in POSH stage-1 patients and 7353135\nSNPs available  maf $5%  in the HEBCS study  In the two study\nmeta-analysis we had close to 6 5 million SNPs available for

previously discussed\n\nthe potential biochemical pathways by which rs421379 could\n\nimpact survival times [19]  It is important to note that the previous\n\nGWAs study that we had undertaken was performed exclusively in\n\nearly onset cases alone  As such the findings from the current study\n\nare potentially important as these suggest a wider role for this\n\nvariant in altering survival times in older breast cancer patients \n\nWe did not observe any significant effect of rs12358475 and\n\nrs421379 on clinical factors associated with breast cancer mortality\n\nsuggesting that fluctuations in levels of clinical variables could be a\n\nby-product of disease rather than being driving factors \n\nrs12358475 is intergenic between ECHDC3  64 kb down-\nstream  and C10orf47  16 kb upstream  and 113 kb upstream of\n\nUPF2  ECHDC3 encodes enoyl CoA hydratase domain contain-\ning 3 which has been described as a new inhibitor of mitochondrial\n\nfatty acid oxidation [34]  Although the clinical significance of this\n\nprotein is not clear  it has been found to be differentially expressed\n\nin different breast cancer subtypes in mouse models [35] \n\nECDHC3 has also been shown to be differentially expressed in\nacute coronary syndrome [36]  UPG2 is involved in both mRNA\nnuclear export and mRNA surveillance and initiates nonsense-\n\nmediated mRNA decay  NMD  [37]  rs12358475 is predicted to\n\ndisrupt a binding site for transcription factors ETS1 and NFAT \nETS-1 is overexpressed in human breast cancer and this is\n\nindicative of poorer prognosis [38–40]

which is a putative\ntumour suppressor gene  This variant has previously been\n\nassociated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma along with other\n\nSNPs close to rs1728400 which demonstrated even stronger\n\nassociations [41]  As such if rs1728400t has a replicable impact on\n\nbreast cancer prognosis then it could act via a different set of\n\ntranscription factors than those activated in oesophageal carcino-\n\nma \n\nAlthough the study reported here is not the largest study\n\nundertaken for identifying common variants associated with breast\n\ncancer mortality [15 16]  it has several methodological strengths  It\n\nis the first study to Meta-analyse associations of common genetic\n\nvariants with breast cancer related mortality on a genome wide\n\nlevel across two independent prospective studies of breast cancer\n\npatients  Further both POSH and HEBCS are prospective studies\n\nof breast cancer patients who were recruited in similar clinical\n\nsettings and both cohorts have relatively high breast cancer specific\n\nmortality  As such  heterogeneity between causes of death is\n\nreduced in the meta-analysis  With respect to potential tumour\n\nphenotypic heterogeneity both studies were not selected for\n\nspecific breast tumour sub-types so this remains a potential\n\nmethodological problem if the effect of SNPs relates to a particular\n\ntumour sub-type or a particular modality of treatment \n\nIt was encouraging to note that 9 off the 18 SNPs which we had\n\nmarked for replication testing were associated in the same\n\ndirection as in the discovery set  Furthermore 4 of the 18 SNPs\n\nwhich were tested for replication had previously been identified as\n\namongst the top 50 associations in GWAs of breast cancer\n\nmortality in early onset patients  rs11723068  rs11491815 \n\nrs421379 and rs1578790 were the first  fourth  eighteenth and\n\n20th most strongly associated SNPs among the top 50 association\n\n[19] \n\nAlthough previous studies have not described any SNPs as\n\nirrevocably associated with survival at genome wide levels of\n\nsignificance [15 18]  we attempted to test associations of the most\n\nsignificant SNPs from these studies  None of the 10 SNPs which\n\nAzzato et al [15] tested for replication in the SEARCH study were\n\nassociated at p-values#0 05 in the POSH and HEBCS meta-\nanalysis results  The strongest replication signal we identified was\n\nwith rs17299684  HR=1 15  p= 0 07  Similarly the two SNPs\n\nhighlighted by Shu et al [18] as potentially associated with survival\n\nin the Chinese population  were not associated in our meta-\n\nanalysis  rs3784099  HR=0 94  P = 0 37 and rs9934948 \n\nHR=1 09  P= 0 32  The association of SNP rs3803662\n\n TOX3  highlighted by Fasching et al [16]  as potentially\nassociated with breast cancer specific survival did not replicate\n\nin our meta-analysis  HR=0 90  p = 0 09  The lone SNP\n\nhighlighted by Azzato et al [17]  as associated with survival in\n\nER-negative patients was not available in the genome wide\n\ngenotyped or imputed data  further no proxies at r2$0 6 were\nidentified based on HapMap phase 3 data  So unfortunately\n\nreplication of this SNP could not be tested in our study \n\nFuture studies with a similar ascertainment framework but with\n\nlarger sample size  detailed tumour sub-type phenotyping and\n\nsimilar treatment modalities will be required to allow sub-type\n\nspecific patient cohorts to be used for discovery and validation  A\n\nmore detailed search for variants with MAF  0 05 may be\nnecessary to fully comprehend the extent of intrinsic host genetic\n\nfactors in determining breast cancer prognosis \n\nThe main strengths of this study are the high genetic coverage\n\nachieved by using the Illumina 550 K and Illumin660 K chips in\n\nthe Helsinki and POSH studies respectively  In addition we have\n\nalso performed comprehensive imputation of common genetic\n\nvariation  maf  =5%  based on the LD patterns in the 1000\ngenomes project  We had sufficient statistical power to detect\n\ngenetic variants which were associated with survival at HR$1 23\nwhile studying SNPs with maf $10%  Future studies using well\nannotated collaborative samples will be needed to perform sub-\n\ntype specific analysis and replication to detect small effect sizes \n\nSuch a strategy has the potential to identify multiple genetic\n\nvariants which are associated at HRs lower than 1 20  However a\n\ntrade-off between the increases in effect sizes that may result from\n\nstudying associations in specific homogeneous sub-groups may\n\nmitigate smaller sample sizes \n\nSupporting Information\n\nChecklist S1 PRISMA Checklist \n\n DOC \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank

highly glycolytic or hypoxic tumors \nare able to produce sufficient quantities of this metabolite to support cell growth and survival \nunder nutrient-limiting conditions remains poorly understood  Here we show that the \nnucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme  ACSS2  supplies a key source of acetyl-CoA for \ntumors by capturing acetate as a carbon source  Despite exhibiting no gross deficits in growth or \ndevelopment  adult mice lacking ACSS2 exhibit a significant reduction in tumor burden in two \ndifferent models of hepatocellular carcinoma  ACSS2 is expressed in a large proportion of human \ntumors and its activity is responsible for the majority of cellular acetate uptake into both lipids and \nhistones  These observations may qualify ACSS2 as a targetable metabolic vulnerability of a wide \nspectrum of tumors \n\n© 2014 Elsevier Inc  All rights reserved \nCorrespondence  steven mcknight@utsouthwestern edu  benjamin tu@utsouthwestern edu \n7Co-first

\ndistinct differences in metabolism between normal and cancerous cells has sparked a \nrenewed interest in targeting metabolic enzymes as an approach to the discovery of new \nanti-cancer therapeutics  The metabolic strategies utilized by cancer cells to enhance \nproliferative capacity under nutrient-limiting conditions remain controversial and poorly \nunderstood  It has thus been unclear as to which aspects of cell metabolism might represent \na realistic  targetable vulnerability of tumors relative to normal cells and tissues \n\nWe recently found that prototrophic yeast cells monitor intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA in \norder to commit to a new round of cell division  Cai et al  2011  Shi and Tu  2013  Acetyl-\nCoA is a key intermediate of carbon sources which not only fuels ATP production via the \nTCA cycle  but also functions as an essential building block for the synthesis of fatty acids \nand sterols  When yeast cells commit to cell division  they significantly enhance the \nproduction of acetyl-CoA  Elevated levels of acetyl-CoA induce acetylation of histones on a \nset of more than 1 000 genes critical for cell growth  Cai et al  2011  This battery of \n“growth genes” includes virtually all genes important for ribosome biogenesis  protein \ntranslation  and amino acid biosynthesis  Transcription of the key G1 cyclin  CLN3  that \ngates entry of yeast cells into the cell division cycle is also dependent upon the ability of \ncells to substantially enhance the intracellular abundance of acetyl-CoA  Shi and Tu  2013  \nThus  in budding yeast  acetyl-CoA is a sentinel metabolite that regulates transcription of \ngrowth genes via epigenetic modification of chromatin  Cai and Tu  2011  Kaelin and \nMcKnight  2013 \n\nThe strict dependence of yeast cells on acetyl-CoA for cell growth and proliferation \nprompted us to examine whether acetyl-CoA might also be rate-limiting for mammalian cell \ngrowth  In well-fed mammalian cells  the acetyl-CoA used for lipid synthesis and histone \nacetylation is primarily supplied by mitochondrially-derived citrate  Srere  1959  Wellen et \nal  2009  This metabolite is enzymatically converted into acetyl-CoA via ATP citrate lyase \n ACLY   Srere  1959  Srere and Lipmann  1953  Cells grown under the nutrient-unlimited \nconditions of tissue culture medium also make acetyl-CoA via citrate consumption  By \ncontrast  the nutrient-limiting conditions of tumor growth in animals and humans bring to \nquestion what pathways might be primarily utilized for acetyl-CoA production  The \nphenomenon of aerobic glycolysis famously characterized by Otto Warburg described the \ntruncation of glucose oxidation at pyruvate  Warburg  1956a  b  Instead of pyruvate being \ntransported into mitochondria for conversion into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate \ndehydrogenase complex  many cancer cells are highly glycolytic and preferentially convert \npyruvate into lactate  If pyruvate fails to enter the TCA cycle in cancer cells  how is it that \nsufficient citrate is made for ACLY-mediated production of acetyl-CoA \n\nSeveral groups have recently demonstrated the conversion of glutamine into acetyl-CoA via \nthe phenomenon of reductive carboxylation whereby the TCA cycle can be modified to run \nin reverse  Le et al  2012  Leonardi et al  2012  Metallo et al  2012  Mullen et al  2012  \nWise et al  2011  Whereas evidence supportive of reductive carboxylation has been \nobtained in studies of cancer cells grown in tissue culture  in vivo studies of primary human \n\nComerford et al

GBMs  to date have revealed little or no catabolism of glutamine  Marin-\nValencia et al  2012  These GBMs instead exhibit substantive mitochondrial oxidation and \na net synthesis of glutamine from glucose  Thus  the ability of glutamine to function as a \nsource of acetyl-CoA in native tumors remains unclear \n\nThese perplexing observations led us to consider alternative sources of acetyl-CoA for \ntumors in which  as a result of highly glycolytic or hypoxic metabolic environments  \nglucose-derived pyruvate is preferentially shunted towards lactate instead of acetyl-CoA  \nBudding yeast lack ATP citrate lyase and instead rely on a family of enzymes called acetyl-\nCoA synthetases  De Virgilio et al  1992  Takahashi et al  2006  van den Berg et al  1996  \nAcetyl-CoA synthetases catalyze the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from acetate and CoA in an \nATP-dependent reaction  Berg  1956  Jones et al  1953  Lipmann and Tuttle  1945  We \nhypothesized that the mammalian versions of these acetyl-CoA synthetase enzymes might \nhelp cancer cells produce acetyl-CoA from acetate under the challenging growth conditions \nof solid tumors  Consistent with this idea  acetate could rescue histone acetylation in cell \nlines in which ACLY was knocked down  although the physiological relevance of acetate in \nmammalian cells was questioned  Wellen et al  2009  However  a role for acetate in fueling \ntumor growth is supported by PET imaging studies using [11C]acetate wherein numerous \nclinical studies have documented avid acetate uptake in prostate  lung  liver and brain \ncancers  Ho et al  2003  Nomori et al  2008  Oyama et al  2002  Tsuchida et al  2008  \nIndeed  in certain cases [11C]acetate PET imaging is more accurate and sensitive than \n[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose  FDG  PET imaging  and some tumors are [11C]acetate-positive \nyet FDGnegative  These considerations have led to the proposal that acetyl-CoA synthetase \nenzymes could be important for [11C]acetate uptake and tumor cell survival  Yoshii et al  \n2009a  Yoshii et al  2009b  Yun et al  2009  In the accompanying manuscript  acetate \nconsumption by human tumors has recently been confirmed by NMR-facilitated \n[13C]acetate metabolic tracer experiments  related paper in this issue  Here we report \nevidence that the nucleocytosolic ACSS2 enzyme is of critical importance for mammalian \ncells to utilize acetate as a source of acetyl-CoA  and that mice lacking this enzyme exhibit a \nsubstantial reduction in tumor burden in two genetic models of liver cancer \n\nRESULTS\nACSS2 is Required for Acetate Uptake and Utilization in Mammalian Cells\n\nThe mammalian genome contains genes encoding three different enzymes capable of \ncatalyzing the ATP-dependent synthesis of acetyl-CoA from acetate  Watkins et al  2007  \nTwo such enzymes  designated ACSS1 and ACSS3  are mitochondrial proteins  Fujino et \nal  2001  Perez-Chacon et al  2009  The third  designated ACSS2  has been reported to be \nlocalized to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of mammalian cells  Ariyannur \net al  2010  Luong et al  2000  In order to assess the relative contributions of these \nenzymes for cellular utilization of acetate for either lipid synthesis or histone acetylation  \nRNAi agents were deployed to selectively silence their respective production  After having \nobserved substantive  RNAi-mediated suppression of ACSS1  ACSS2  and ACSS3  Figure \nS1  cells were exposed to 14C-labeled acetate in order to measure incorporation of acetyl \nunits into either lipids or histones  RNAi-mediated suppression of ACSS2 led to a more \n\nComerford et al  Page 3\n\nCell  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2015 December 18 \n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author M\nanuscript\n\nN\nIH\n\n-PA Author

order to pursue these observations in a more rigorous manner  mouse embryonic \nfibroblasts  MEFs  were prepared from embryos of mice bearing inactivating mutations in \nboth alleles of ACSS2  ACSS2−/−  Littermate embryos heterozygous for the ACSS2 \nmutation  ACSS2−/+  and wild type littermates  ACSS2+/+  were also used to prepare \nMEFs  Figure S1  When exposed to [14C]acetate  ACSS2−/− MEFs showed a substantial \ndeficit in label incorporation into both lipids and histones relative to ACSS2+/+ MEFs \n Figures 1C–D  Cells heterozygous for ACSS2  +/−  revealed an intermediate decrement in \n[14C]acetate uptake \n\nAs a third means of testing the importance of ACSS2 for acetate uptake into mammalian \ncells  a high-throughput screen was conducted in search of chemical inhibitors of the \nenzyme  Purified  recombinant human ACSS2 enzyme was screened against roughly \n200 000 drug-like chemicals housed within the UTSWMC compound file  The details of this \nscreen are presented in the Experimental Procedures  Among hundreds of primary hits cross-\nscreened for reversibility  dose-responsive potency  and selectivity with respect to inhibition \nof medium- and long-chain Coenzyme A-dependent acyl-CoA synthetase enzymes  a small \nmolecule quinoxaline having an IC50 of ~0 6 µM in biochemical assays  and ~5 µM in its \nability to inhibit cellular [14C]acetate uptake into both lipids and histones  Figures 1E–F  \nemerged as one of the most favorable inhibitors of ACSS2  Moreover  this inhibitor did not \nreduce the residual acetate uptake observed in ACSS2−/− MEFs  Figure S1  The fact that a \nselective chemical inhibitor of ACSS2 substantially inhibits acetate incorporation into both \nlipids and histones further confirms the importance of this enzyme for cellular uptake of \nacetate \n\nAs a final test of the importance of ACSS2 for acetate uptake  shRNA-mediated attenuation \nof ACSS2 was tested on four different cancer cell lines  including LL/2  PC3  U2OS and \nHep3B  Figure S1  In all four cancer cell lines  attenuation of ACSS2 led to a significant \nimpediment to [14C]acetate uptake into both lipids and histones  Figures 1G–H  The \ncombination of shRNA-mediated mRNA knockdown approaches  studies of MEFs \nselectively mutated at the ACSS2 locus  and the identification of a selective chemical \ninhibitor of ACSS2 provide strong evidence that this particular enzyme is primarily \nresponsible for allowing mammalian cells to convert acetate into acetyl-CoA for subsequent \nmetabolic utilization \n\nReduced Tumor Formation in ACSS2-Deficient Mice\nAs a means of testing the contribution of ACSS2 to tumorigenesis  we introduced the \nACSS2-null allele into a strain of genetically-engineered mice that develop liver cancer due \nto expression of a liverspecific  doxycycline  dox -regulated transgene encoding the SV40 \nearly region  ApoE-rtTAM2 TRE2-TAg  herein referred to as TAg  Notably  adult ACSS2-\nnull mice display no overt phenotypic deficits and both sexes are fertile  Cohorts of male \nand female TAg mice with and without ACSS2 were generated as described in Experimental \nProcedures and provided with drinking water supplemented with 10 µg/mL doxycycline for \n42–45 days  This regimen promotes reproducible and robust multifocal tumor development \n\nComerford et al  Page 4\n\nCell

the liver  % liver/body weight  and the relative \namount of tumor-free liver as described in detail  Table S2 \n\nAfter 42–45 days of dox treatment  livers of ACSS2+/+ TAg mice were covered with small \nto medium-sized tumors reflecting multifocal tumor growth in response to sustained \nexpression of the SV40 large T and small t  LT/st  oncoproteins  20/21 mice  95%  \nexhibited tumor burden scores of 8 or greater  Figure 2A  By contrast  only 48% of \nACSS2−/− TAg mice exhibited tumor growth of an equivalent magnitude  with almost half \n 41%  receiving scores of 6 or lower  The statistical significance in the overall reduction in \nmean tumor burden score from 9 4 to 6 8 in mice with and without ACSS2 achieved a \ncalculated p-value of 0 0002  Figure 2A  Given that tumor burdens within the 9–10 range \nand 6–7 range reflected the presence of 100–200 tumors  too many to accurately count  or \n20–50 tumors respectively  these data indicate that ACSS2-deficiency reduces the absolute \nnumber of liver tumors by at least 4-fold \n\nHaving shown that loss of ACSS2 correlates with reduced tumor burdens in the TAg liver \ncancer model  we next asked what impact of loss of ACSS2 might have on the development \nof tumors driven by c-Myc overexpression and loss of PTEN  both of which are associated \nwith human hepatocarcinogenesis  Kawate et al  1999  Peng et al  1993  Yao et al  1999  \nIn this genetically-engineered mouse model  liver-specific expression of c-Myc  Sandgren et \nal  1989  in conjunction with hepatic deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor  PTENlox/lox  \n Lesche et al  2002  promotes the development of at least two large tumors  >10mm  per \nliver in a background of hepatomegaly in 90% of mice at 6–7 months of age  Comerford and \nHammer  unpublished observations  This second liver cancer model  herein referred to as c-\nMyc ΔPTEN  constitutes a more stochastic and clinically relevant model of hepatic tumor \ndevelopment than the SV40 TAg model  Cohorts of male and female c-Myc ΔPTEN mice \nwith and without ACSS2 were generated as described in Experimental Procedures and \nsacrificed at 6–7 months of age  Livers were scored for tumor development using a scale \nthat differed from the one used to score the TAg tumors to accommodate the more stochastic \npattern of tumor development in these mice  Table S2 \n\nAt 6–7 months of age  20/24  83%  of ACSS2+/+ cMyc ΔPTEN mice had livers with at \nleast 10 visible tumors  2–15mm in size  resulting in assignment of tumor burden scores of \n7 or greater  Figure 2B  This was in direct contrast to cohorts of age-matched ACSS2−/− c-\nMyc ΔPTEN mice in which only 6/21 mice  29%  had tumor burdens of 7 or greater  \nIndeed  ACSS2-deficiency not only reduced the mean tumor burden score from 7 8 to 4 7  p \n  60%  30–60% or < 30% ACSS2-positive \ncells respectively  Tumors that did not contain any visible ACSS2-positive cells were \ndesignated ACSS2NEG

\ncurves were used to estimate overall survival  which was defined as the time from date of \nsurgery to date death from TNBC or to the last follow-up date for censored cases  The log-\nrank test was performed to compare survival between groups  A P-value of <0 05 was \nconsidered significant \n\nHigh-Throughput Screen to Identify inhibitors of Human ACSS2\nHuman ACSS2 enzyme was expressed in

be used as a priority in patients with increased serum CA 15-3\n\nlevels  or with clinical/radiologic suspicion of recurrence  and might be useful for\n\nasymptomatic patients \n\nIntroduction\n\nIncreasingly  breast cancer is becoming a leading cause of cancer-related mortality\n\nin the Western and Eastern worlds [1  2]  The incidence of breast cancer has\n\nincreased 4-fold in the past twenty years  In Taiwan  it has become the most\n\ncommon female cancer  and the fourth cause of cancer deaths in women [2] \n\nDepending on the extent of the disease  up to 35% of patients who receive full\n\ntreatment  surgery and others  will ultimately develop local recurrence or\n\nsecondary tumor dissemination to distant organs [3] \n\nSerum CA 15-3 has been used as a tumor marker for detecting asymptomatic or\n\nearly recurrences of breast cancer that might be amenable to curative therapy \n\nAlthough increased serum CA 15-3 levels precede the symptoms of metastasis by a\n\nmean time of 2-9 months  current international guidelines do not recommend its\n\nroutine use for screening for metastases because of its moderate sensitivity and the\n\nabsence of clinical impact [4–6]  Furthermore  additional imaging examinations\n\nare required to detect the exact location and extension of recurrent lesions \n\nPositron emission tomography with the glucose analog tracer 2-[18F]fluoro-2-\n\ndeoxy-D-glucose  FDG-PET  is an imaging method that is based on the increase\n\nin glucose metabolism in malignant tumors  In breast cancer patients  FDG-PET\n\nhas been reported to be useful in evaluating the initial tumor  including\n\nlocoregional or distant staging  in evaluating treatment response  and in assessing\n\nrecurrent disease [7–10]  A meta-analysis of 16 clinical reports that included 808\n\npatients determined that the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET in detecting\n\nbreast cancer recurrences and metastases was 92 7% and 81 6%  respectively [11] \n\nCurrently  integrated PET/CT has emerged as a promising imaging modality that\n\nis being applied more routinely in clinical situations  PET/CT evaluates both the\n\nmetabolic activity and anatomy at the same location in the body  and is useful in\n\naccurately staging metastatic disease  assessing response to systemic treatment and\n\nclarifying equivocation with other imaging modalities [12]  A systematic review of\n\nthe diagnosis of breast cancer recurrence showed that PET/CT has significantly\n\nhigher sensitivity than PET  96% vs  85%  P50 006  and conventional imaging\n\ntests  95% vs  80%  P50 015  and higher specificity than PET  89% vs  82%  and\n\nconventional imaging tests  89% vs  77%  Changes in the management of the\n\nstudy patients ranged from 11% to 74% [13] \n\nEarly detection of recurrent cancer in a suspected or even asymptomatic patient\n\nprovides more treatment options and offers a better prognosis and a good\n\nPET/CT in Post-Therapy Surveillance of Breast Cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115127 December 17  2014 2 / 14\n\n\n\noutcome  PET/CT scans are more sensitive than conventional imaging  and the\n\ndetection of unsuspected lesions often alters the therapeutic plans  However  there\n\nis no consensus on whether PET/CT scans should be used as a standard\n\ncomponent of the restaging evaluation in women with suspected recurrence or an\n\nasymptomatic patient  The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of FDG-PET/\n\nCT in the post-therapy surveillance of breast cancer \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPatients\nWe retrospectively collected data from patients with prior histories of breast\n\ncancer and complete responses to treatment  i e  primary surgery and/or\n\nchemotherapy  The patients  who underwent FDG-PET/CT scans from June 2006\n\nto Jan  2012  were divided into 2 groups as follows  patients with elevated serum\n\nCA 15-3 levels 31 3 U/ml [14]  Group 1  or patients with clinical/radiologic\n\nsuspicions recurrences without increased serum CA 15-3 levels  Group 2  Data\n\nfrom another group of patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT for asymptomatic\n\npost-therapy surveillance of recurrent breast cancer from our institution were also\n\ncollected for comparison  The exclusion criteria for this study included stage IV of\n\nbreast cancer at the time of initial diagnosis  vital sign instability  severe diabetes \n\nsevere illness  confirmed existence of 1 or more additional tumors and an inability\n\nto remain supine for 30 minutes  Finally  140 FDG-PET/CT consecutive studies of\n\npatients with prior breast cancer after complete therapy were obtained  According\n\nto the study application forms  71 studies were referred due to suspected\n\nrecurrence  the indications of which included increased CA 15-3 levels  n531 \n\nsuspicious or indeterminate lesion on sonography  n514  CT scans  n57 \n\nwhole body bone scan  n53  mammography  n53  and chest film  n51 \n\npalpable breast or axillary nodules  n59  clinical symptoms of recurrence  n52 \n\nand the elevation of other serum tumor markers  n51  The detailed patient\n\ncharacteristics are shown in Table 1  The American Joint Committee on Cancer\n\n AJCC  classification was used for the initial breast cancer staging  This study was\n\napproved by the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital institutional review board \n\nThe written or verbal informed consent to participate in this study was waived by\n\nthe hospital ethics committee because of the retrospective nature of the study \n\nFDG PET/CT imaging\nThe patients fasted for at least 6 hours prior to the FDG PET/CT imaging  An\n\nintravenous catheter was placed for radiopharmaceutical administration  and the\n\npatient’s blood glucose levels were measured prior to injecting the tracer  All\n\npatients had blood glucose levels  150 mg/dl at the time of injection  Each\n\npatient received 370–555 MBq of 18F-FDG based on body weight  7 03 MBq/kg \n\nAfter the tracer injection  the patients rested for 1 hour on a comfortable bed in a\n\ndark room  Whole-body FDG-PET/CT imaging

from the head to the upper thigh with the\n\npatients in a supine position  A delayed image with or without the use of diuretics\n\nwas obtained when necessary  CT scanning was performed prior to acquiring the\n\nPET data  The following parameters were used  0 6 seconds per rotation  120 kV \n\n100 mA  and 3 75-mm-thick slices  After performing plain CT  PET images of the\n\nsame areas were acquired in a two-dimensional mode  and 4 minutes of data were\n\ncollected per bed position  Attenuation-corrected PET images were reconstructed\n\nwith an ordered subset expectation maximization iterative reconstructed\n\nalgorithm  The 3 75-mm thick transaxial CT images were reconstructed at 3 27-\n\nmm intervals for fusion with the PET images  PET  CT  and fused PET/CT images\n\nwere generated on a Xeleris image display and processing platform  GE\n\nHealthcare  for review on a computer workstation \n\nImage analysis\nThe PET  CT  and fused PET/CT images were interpreted by two qualified nuclear\n\nmedicine physicians who were allowed to manipulate the image contrast  image\n\nintensities  and three-dimensional images on a computer screen  The final\n\ndiagnoses were made by consensus  The physicians were not blinded to the\n\nreasons for the examinations or the outcomes at the times of the image analysis \n\nBecause this was a retrospective study  the reasons for the examination were\n\ndescribed on the application form  Each study was regarded as an independent\n\nevent  and prior imaging  including prior PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT\n\nTable 1  Patient

with various malignant tumors  The advantages of FDG-PET/CT in\n\ndetecting recurrent breast cancer include the high sensitivity  reasonable\n\nFig  2  A 46-year-old woman with a history of breast

December 17  2014 10 / 14\n\n\n\nspecificity and the ability to screen the entire body in one imaging session \n\nPrevious studies have included different proportions of recurrent patients ranging\n\nfrom 68–93% [7–10  15]  and the incidence of distant metastasis ranged from 70–\n\n81% [10  15]  The proportion of recurrence  35%  49/140  and the incidence of\n\ndistant metastasis  49%  24/49  in our patients were lower than those reported in\n\npast studies  This difference might be because  having shown significant benefit in\n\nrecent years  more aggressive breast cancer treatments are being used [10–11  16] \n\nThe early detection and accurate restaging of recurrent breast cancer is important\n\nfor selecting the appropriate therapeutic strategy  which may offer a better\n\nprognosis and a good outcome  In the presented study  recurrences were\n\ndiagnosed in 56 3%  40/71  of patients with suspected recurrence and also in 13%\n\n 9/69  of asymptomatic patients  FDG-PET/CT resulted in changes in 49 3%  35/\n\n71  of patients with suspected recurrence and also in 10 1%  7/69  of\n\nasymptomatic patients \n\nBlood tumor markers are widely used to follow patients who are being treated\n\nfor malignant tumors  However  the low incidence of elevated serum CA 15-3\n\nconcentrations in early-stage cancer suggests that this marker lacks the necessary\n\nsensitivity for detecting early metastatic disease  In the present study  38 8%  19/\n\n49  of recurrent patients had elevated serum CA 15-3 levels before or at the time\n\nof recurrence  this result was aligned with prior studies that reported the\n\nsensitivity of serum CA 15-3 for detecting recurrent breast cancer ranged from\n\n35 3% to 50% [16–18]  The American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO \n\nrecommendations for the use of tumor markers does not support the use of serum\n\nCA 15-3 to monitor disease recurrence during follow-up for treated breast cancer\n\n[6]  Conversely  FDG-PET/CT is useful in detecting recurrent breast cancer  In\n\nour study  PET/CT detected 42 of 49 recurrent cancers  with a sensitivity and\n\nspecificity of 85 7% and 90 1%  respectively  which aligns with prior studies  in\n\nwhich the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 81% to 96% and 52% to 89% \n\nrespectively [13  15–19]  In this study FDG-PET/CT showed a higher sensitivity\n\nand specificity of 94 7% and 91 7%  respectively  in patients with elevated serum\n\nCA15-3 level compared to other groups of patients without elevated serum\n\nCA15-3 level  although these results were not statistically significant  However  the\n\nPPV in the patients with increased serum CA 15-3 levels was higher than that in\n\nasymptomatic patients  P50 012  In some countries  serum CA 15-3 still plays a\nrole in patient follow-up for monitoring distant recurrence [20–22]  It also  serves\n\nas a prognostic factor [4–5]  and has been used as an inclusion criterion for\n\nfurther imaging examinations in cases of suspected recurrence [7–13  15–16  19] \n\nGrassetto G et al  conducted a multicenter study that suggested FDG-PET/CT\n\nplays a potential role in asymptomatic patients with rising serum CA 15-3 and\n\nnegative conventional imaging [23]  In their study  the sensitivity of serum\n\nCA 15-3 was similar to that in our patient group  45% vs  47 5%  FDG-PET/CT\n\ncould detect the smallest lesion  0 7 cm  as was the case in this study  However \n\nmore cases with a solitary lesion amenable to radical therapy were present in their\n\nstudy  57 5%  23/40  which might be due to timely follow-up of serum CA 15-3\n\nand the close monitoring of the high risk patient group and highly selected\n\nPET/CT in Post-Therapy Surveillance of Breast Cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115127 December 17  2014 11 / 14\n\n\n\npatients with negative conventional imaging  Our data are in agreement with a\n\nnumber of studies [7–13  23]  and suggest the timely detection of early recurrence\n\nsuch as by using tumor markers and FDG-PET/CT  has a major impact on therapy\n\nand survival \n\nRecently  published data from the National Oncologic PET Registry concerning\n\npatients with a variety of cancers have shown that the intended management\n\nchanged for 36 5% of the patients following PET [24]  In a retrospective study of\n\n125 patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer  the therapeutic plan was\n\naltered in 32% of the patients based on the FDG-PET findings [10]  In another\n\nstudy of 134 patients with suspicion of recurrence either clinically or on\n\nconventional imaging  suspected recurrence  [SR]  or with isolated increases in\n\ntumor marker levels  occult recurrence  [OR]  a 44% overall change in\n\nmanagement  43% in the SR group and 45% in the OR group were observed [7] \n\nIn the current study  FDG-PET/CT results changed the planned management in\n\n30% of the patients  more so for patients with suspected recurrence than in\n\nasymptomatic patients  49 3% vs  10 1%  P 0 001 \n\nFDG-PET/CT is also helpful for selecting patients who might derive a\n\nsignificant survival benefit from optimal surgical strategy  Although there are still\n\ninherent false positive and false negative results  patients might also benefit from\n\nthese false-positive findings  In our study  false positives resulted in surgical\n\nresection of 2 second primary cancers that were independent of prior breast\n\ncancer  An earlier recognition of synchronous cancers might allow more effective\n\ntreatment options and improve patient survival rates  Further  two patients with\n\npulmonary tuberculosis were appropriately treated  Four false-negatives  derived\n\nfrom the definition of recurrent lesions  were found within 12 months of the\n\nFDG-PET/CT  FDG-PET/CT were limited by the resolution and the inability to\n\ndetect microscopic metastasis as FDG-PET/CT is relatively less sensitive in\n\ndetecting lesions  1 cm in size [25–26]  In this study  we detected two chest wall\n\nlesions less than 1 cm  0 7 cm and 0 8 cm  respectively  whereas a 0 5 cm\n\nrecurrent breast lesion was interpreted as being a benign lesion \n\nOur study had limitations  First  this study was retrospective and FDG-PET/CT\n\nwas randomly applied by asymptomatic patients themselves  Therefore  this might\n\nhave resulted in some bias  Second  only 24 of the 140  17 1%  patients were\n\nproven based on histology  and the others were diagnosed via other imaging\n\nmodalities and/or clinical follow-up  Third  the total case numbers were small \n\nFurther studies with a prospective trial looking at the specific question of\n\nrecurrence in asymptomatic patients would be of interest \n\nConclusions\n\nFDG-PET/CT scans are useful in the early diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer and\n\nthus might improve the survival rates of these patients  In this study  FDG-PET/\n\nCT had high overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent breast cancer\n\nand higher PPV in the patients with increased serum CA 15-3 levels than that in\n\nPET/CT in Post-Therapy Surveillance of Breast Cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI 10 1371/journal pone 0115127 December 17  2014 12 / 14\n\n\n\nthe asymptomatic patients  Patients with suspected recurrence had a much greater\n\nproportion of recurrences  a greater incidence of distant metastasis and higher\n\nmortality rates than asymptomatic patients  Therefore  FDG-PET/CT should be\n\nused as a priority in patients with increased serum CA 15-3 levels  or with clinical/\n\nradiologic suspicion of recurrence  and might be useful for asymptomatic patients \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Miss Yi-Ru Chen and Ching-Jie Peng for their

with four or more positive lymph nodes after postmastectomy radiotherapy\n PMRT \n\nMethods  This retrospective study examined 605 breast cancer patients with four or more positive lymph nodes\nwho underwent mastectomy  A total of 371 patients underwent PMRT  The prognostic value of the NLN count in\npatients with and without PMRT was analyzed  The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves  and Cox\nregression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors \n\nResults  The median follow-up was 54 months  and the overall 8-year locoregional recurrence-free survival  LRFS \ndistant metastasis-free survival  DMFS  disease-free survival  DFS  and overall survival  OS  were 79 8%  50 0%  46 8% \nand 57 9%  respectively  The optimal cut-off points for NLN count was 12  Univariate analysis showed that the\nnumber of NLNs  lymph node ratio  LNR  and pN stage predicted the LRFS of non-PMRT patients  p   0 65 \n\nTreatment\nAdjuvant chemotherapy was administered to all patients\nfor a median of 6 cycles  range  4–8 cycles  with 29 pa-\ntients  4 8%  receiving a regimen consisting of cyclo-\nphosphamide  methotrexate  and 5-fluorouracil  CMF \nand 576  95 2%  receiving regimens with anthracycline\nand/or taxane  All patients were recommended for PMRT \nbut the patient made the final decision over whether to\nproceed  Of the 234 patients  38 7%  did not receive\nPMRT due to economic and social factors  A total of\n371 patients  61 3%  received PMRT within 6 months\nafter surgery  The PMRT was delivered mainly to the\n\nipsilateral chest wall  supra- and infra-clavicular lymph\nnode regions  The total radiation dose was 46–50 Gy in\n\n\n\nThe median number of RLNs in the entire cohort was\n18  range  10–73  the median number in the non-PMRT\ngroup

indicates a significant difference \nthan 10 NLNs  and the difference was especially signi-\nficant in patients with positive lymph nodes [9]  Kuru re-\nported better OS of patients with more than 15 NLNs\n[10]  We used Cox multivariate analysis  with NLN\ncount  LNR  and pN stage as covariates  and found that\nthe number of NLNs was an independent prognostic\nfactor for LRFS  but that LNR and pN stage had no sig-\nnificant effect on prognosis  These results suggest that\nthe number of NLNs may be a better indicator of axil-\nlary lymph node status in breast cancer patients \nAt present  the mechanism underlying why the num-\n\nber of NLNs can be used to predict the survival of breast\ncancer patients is still unclear  However  previous studies\nshowed that this relationship might be explained by\n“stage migration” or by the host’s immune response to\ntumor cells and the molecular biology of tumor cells\n[15-17]  For example  a study of colorectal cancer pa-\ntients found that the lymphocyte response to the tumor\nwas related to patient survival [18] \nThe LRR of breast cancer is an important factor used\n\nto guide the selection of PMRT  The status of axillary\nlymph nodes has been always one of the main factors\nused to guide selection of PMRT  PMRT remains the\nstandard therapy for breast cancer patients who have\nfour or more positive lymph nodes  PMRT can elimin-\nate residual occult lesions in the ipsilateral chest wall\nand lymph drainage area  and thereby improve survival \nPMRT improves the prognosis of breast cancer patients\nwith 4 or more positive axillary lymph nodes [19]  Our\nsubgroup analysis showed that the LRR was relatively\n\nated with locoregional recurrence free survival in patients\n\nalysis Multivariate analyses\n\n5% CI p HR 95% CI p\n\n

obvious benefit for these patients \nIn addition  we also found that PMRT improved locore-\ngional control by reducing nodal recurrences but without\nany effect on local control in the chest wall in patients\nwith a fewer number of NLNs  This supports our hypo-\nthesis that patients with fewer NLNs may have more re-\nsidual lesions  which increases the rate of locoregional\nrecurrence  However  for patients with more NLNs  sur-\ngery can reduce the number of residual lesions  and these\npatients do not benefit significantly from PMRT \nThe American College of Surgeons Oncology Group\n\n ACOSOG  Z0011 trial reported that axillary lymph node\ndissection did not affect the local recurrence and survival\nrates of patients without positive sentinel lymph nodes\nor with 1–2 positive sentinel lymph nodes after breast-\nconserving therapy [20 21]  Thus  axillary lymph node\ndissection is unnecessary in these patients [20 21]  How-\never  the St  Gallen International Breast Cancer Confer-\nence  2013  reported that axillary lymph node dissection\nwas necessary for cases who did not receive radiotherapy\nand for those with 3 or more metastases in the sentinel\nlymph nodes [11]  Thus  the status of axillary lymph nodes\nis an important indicator that affects the prognosis of\nbreast cancer patients and is useful in guiding therapy \nIn the present study  the number of NLNs

status of axil-\nlary lymph nodes can be accurately determined  axillary\nlymph node dissection is a very important procedure for\npatients with positive axillary lymph nodes  In particu-\nlar axillary lymph node dissection can reduce the risk of\noccult lesions  allows some patients to omit radiotherapy\nand thereby avoid radiation injury [22-24]  and thereby\nimproves patient quality of life and prolongs survival \nWe need to recognize the limitations of the present\n\nstudy  First  this study is a single-center retrospective\nstudy and is not representative of the breast cancer\n\nFigure 3 Impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy on locoregional rec\ndisease-free survival  C  and overall survival  D  of patients with 12 o\npopulation at large  In addition  the optimal number of\nNLNs in present study is different from the number in\nother studies  This may be related to differences in the\nclinical characteristics of the patient populations  use of\ndifferent surgical procedures  and analysis by different\nstatistical method  However  based on the relationship\nbetween the number of NLNs and host immune response\n[16 17]  sufficient attention should be paid to differences\nin individual patient immune status  Ultimately  multi-\ncenter prospective studies should be performed to verify\nthe value of the number of NLNs in breast cancer patients\nto determine the most appropriate cut-off point  Finally \n\nurrence-free survival  A  distant metastases-free survival  B \nr fewer NLNs \n\n\n\nWu et al  Radiation Oncology   2014  9 284 Page 8 of

conclusion  the results of the present study show that\nthe number of NLNs is a prognostic factor for LRFS in\nbreast cancer patients with four or more positive lymph\nnodes after mastectomy  Patients with more NLNs have\nlower LRR  and the number of NLNs can predict the\noutcome of PMRT  PMRT might represent for certain\npatients with a lower number of NLNs  but not in pa-\ntients with a higher number of NLNs  Future prospec-\ntive studies are needed to confirm these results \n\nAdditional file\n\nAdditional file 1  Table S1  Characteristics of breast cancer patients\naccording to different
