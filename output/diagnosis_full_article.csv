endocrine\ntherapy  and targeted therapy  overall survival rates of breast\ncancer have increased  however  these therapies have not\nproduced signiﬁcant changes in the prognosis of patients with\nbreast cancer accompanied by distant metastasis \nThe main sites of metastasis for breast cancer are the bone \n\nlung  and liver  whereas metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is\nrelatively rare  reported incidence rates are 2% to 18% of breast\ncancer cases  Importantly  gastric metastasis from invasive\nlobular breast carcinoma is reported to occur at a higher rate\nthan the metastasis from invasive ductal carcinoma [2] Gastric\ncancer has high incidence rates in Korea [1] and differentiation\nbetween primary gastric cancer and metastatic gastric cancer\nbased solely on clinical

this study  in which a\nis occurred only in the stomach at the time of primary\ns of breast cancer  is extremely rare \npresent case  gastric metastasis was not detected during a\nexamination performed at the time of breast cancer\ns  PET scans obtained before surgery did not show any\nof gastric tumors  tumors were observed only in breast\nlary lesions  The sensitivity of PET is reported to be\nlower for the diagnosis of gastric cancer compared with\nother cancer types  and this is attributed to issues\nd with physiological absorption of F-18 ﬂuorodeox-\nand involuntary movements by the gastric wall  Gastric\norphology is also associated with sensitivity of PET \nh the sensitivity of PET is high for papillary or ductal\na and poorly differentiated solid adenocarcinoma  high\native rates are reported for signet ring cell carcinoma and\nifferentiated nonsolid adenocarcinoma [4]\n\neral  it is difﬁcult to differentially diagnose primary\nancer and metastatic gastric

decisions can\nbased on clinical symptoms of an individual patient  and\nof multidisciplinary teams  including those in charge of\nrointestinal tract  is crucial in the decision-making\nAlthough

regions\nof the gastrointestinal tract in most cases  surgical treatment of\ngastric tumors is not recommended as a primary treatment\noption  Surgical treatment  such as bypass surgery  may be used\nin cases of complete intestinal obstruction or in emergencies  such\nas perforation of the gastric wall  McLemore et al treated some\npatients with gastric metastasis using conventional surgical\nprocedures for symptom relief  and reported no increase in\nsurvival rates after surgery  Speciﬁcally  they reported that the\npatient’s history of undergoing chemotherapy or hormone\ntherapy is an important prognostic factor  whereas old age\nand the presence of gastric metastasis are poor prognostic\nfactors [13]\n\nIn conclusion  we have reported a case of invasive lobular\ncarcinoma with gastric metastasis  which can be misdiagnosed as\nprimary gastric cancer  Accurate diagnosis and patient-tailored\ntreatment can be achieved through clinical suspicion

outcome\n\nduction\n\nncer  BC  is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy\nleading cause of cancer death among women\n\nworldwide [1] Although early detection and comprehensive\ntreatment have been implemented  the 5-year survival rate\namong patients with BC who develop metastatic disease is only\n24% [2] To improve the clinical outcome of patients  there is an\nurgent need for the development of early biomarkers that could\nprovide prognostic information regarding treatment response\nand disease progression \nAt present  evaluation of the metabolic tumor burden in BC is\n\ndependent on serum markers  including Cancer Antigen 15-3\n CA15-3  and Carcinoembryonic Antigen  CEA  The major\nissues with using these markers  however  are a lack of sensitivity\nand speciﬁcity  especially in early or localized disease [3 4]\n\nTherefore  in recent years  much effort has been devoted to the\ndetection and characterization of circulating cell-free DNA\n cfDNA  in BC  cfDNA is nucleic acid fragments that circulate in\nthe plasma  serum  and other bodily ﬂuids outside of cells  The\nﬁrst report was by Mandel and Metais in 1948 [5] but the topic\nattracted little attention in the scientiﬁc community  It was not\nuntil 1977 that cfDNA was recognized as a useful tool for\nmonitoring the effects of therapy in cancer patients [6] In healthy\nindividuals  cfDNA is derived from apoptotic cells and is\n\nted  measuring 185 to 200 base pairs  bp  in length \nas in cancer patients it results from apoptotic and necrotic\n\ncells [7 8] Therefore  elevated levels of long DNA

46%\n\nfrom 1995 to 2015 1 and it is now the most common cancer and the\n\nfifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Japanese\n\nwomen 2 Globally  between 5% and 10% of breast cancers are meta-\n\nstatic at the time of diagnosis 3 and ABC  including recurrent disease\n\nand mBC  is incurable 4 posing a significant public health burden and\n\nconsiderable treatment challenges 5\n\nFor postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC  endocrine therapy\n\nwith agents such as aromatase inhibitors  eg  anastrozole  letrozole \n\nor exemestane  is the standard first-line treatment6 and is recom-\n\nmended by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guide-\n\nlines 7 However  current first-line endocrine therapy alone may\n\nprovide only modest benefit in patients with HR+ ABC  and some\n\npatients may not respond at all 6 indicating the need for new treat-\n\nment options  In a randomized phase III trial of exemestane vs anas-\n\ntrozole as first-line therapy in Japanese women with HR+ ABC \n\nmedian time to progression was approximately 12 months in each\n\ngroup 8 Thus  there is interest in improving outcomes by combining\n\nfirst-line endocrine therapy with other agents \n\nPalbociclib is a potent  orally active  highly selective inhibitor of\n\nCDK4/6  it actively arrests cell cycle progression from the G1 phase\n\nto the S phase to inhibit DNA synthesis and the pathologic cellular\n\nproliferation characteristic of breast malignancies 9-11 Palbociclib\n\nshowed antiproliferative activity alone and synergistic activity with\n\ntamoxifen in ER+ luminal breast cancer cell lines 10 In clinical trials in\n\nnon-Japanese patients with retinoblastoma protein-positive solid\n\ntumors  single-agent palbociclib showed antitumor efficacy with an\n\nacceptable safety profile and was well tolerated 12 13 In an open-\n\nlabel  phase II PALOMA-1 trial  efficacy and safety of first-line letro-\n\nzole  2 5 mg QD  alone or in combination with palbociclib  125 mg\n\nQD  3 weeks on  1 week off [3/1 schedule]  was investigated in\n\nnon-Japanese postmenopausal women with ER+ and HER2  ABC 14\nMedian PFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than\n\nwith letrozole alone  20 2 vs 10 2 months  respectively  HR  0 49 \n\n95% CI  0 32-0 75  one-sided P =  0004  AEs with combination ther-\n\napy were predictable and manageable  neutropenia was the most\n\ncommonly reported AE 14 These findings were confirmed in the\n\nphase III PALOMA-2 trial in postmenopausal women with ER+/\n\nHER2  ABC who received letrozole with or without palbociclib  3/1\nschedule  as first-line therapy 15 Consistent with PALOMA-1  median\n\nPFS was significantly longer with combination therapy than with\n\nletrozole monotherapy  24 8 vs 14 5 months  HR  0 58  95% CI \n\n0 46-0 72  two-sided P  480 ms  based\n\non the mean value of triplicate ECGs  family or personal history of\n\nQT syndrome were also ineligible \n\n2 3 | Study treatment\n\nPatients received 125 mg palbociclib orally QD with food on days 1\n\nto 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off palbociclib treat-\n\nment  coadministered with letrozole 2 5 mg orally QD  Study treat-\n\nments were continued until radiologically documented PD according\n\nto RECIST  v1 1  symptomatic deterioration  unacceptable toxicity \n\nor withdrawal of consent \n\nPalbociclib dose interruptions or delays were permitted if patients\n\nexperienced the following protocol-specified treatment-related AEs \n\nuncomplicated grade 3 neutropenia  ANC  480 ms  more frequent ECG monitoring occurred per the investiga-\n\ntor’s best medical judgment until QTc was ≤480 ms  If these criteria\n\nwere met within 2 weeks of the dose interruption or cycle delay  pal-\n\nbociclib treatment was resumed  If not  resumption or permanent dis-\n\ncontinuation of palbociclib treatment was based on the investigator’s\n\nbest medical judgment of whether the patient was deriving clinical\n\nbenefit from treatment \n\nProtocol-specified palbociclib dose reductions were permitted \n\ndepending on the type and severity of toxicity reported  The recom-\n\nmended first dose reduction was from 125 to 100 mg/d  and the\n\nrecommended second dose reduction was from 100 to 75 mg/d \n\nPatients requiring >2 palbociclib dose reductions were discontinued\n\nfrom the study but remained in the follow-up phase  Subsequent\n\ntreatment cycles were given at the reduced dose level  dose re-esca-\n\nlation was not permitted  Patients who continued receiving letrozole\n\nremained in the active treatment phase of the study \n\nLetrozole dose interruptions for treatment-related toxicities were\n\npermitted based on the investigator’s judgment  Letrozole dose\n\nreductions were not permitted  Patients who discontinued letrozole\n\nbecause of treatment-related toxicity also discontinued palbociclib\n\nand  consequently  were discontinued from the active treatment\n\nphase of the study and instead entered the follow-up phase \n\n2 4 | Assessments\n\n2 4 1 | Efficacy\n\nDisease assessments included computed tomography or magnetic res-\n\nonance imaging of the chest  abdomen  pelvis  and any other sites of\n\ndisease as clinically indicated  clinical assessment of superficial disease\n\n including lesion measurements  and radionucleotide bone scans  All\n\nbaseline assessments were carried out before giving study drugs  pal-\n\nbociclib and letrozole  Postbaseline tumor assessments were done\n\nevery 12 weeks and bone scans  if applicable  every 24 weeks until\n\nevidence of disease progression  Radiographic disease progression\n\nusing RECIST or clinical disease progression  if photographed or palpa-\n\nble lesions  was assessed  Objective tumor response  using RECIST \n\nwas reported as ORR  percentage of patients with CR + PR  and DCR\n\n percentage of patients with CR + PR + stable disease lasting\n\n≥24 weeks  All radiographic or clinical  where applicable  efficacy\n\nevaluations were based on investigator assessments  OS was deter-\n\nmined every 6 months from the last dose of study treatment \n\n2 4 2 | Pharmacokinetics\n\nA subset of 6 patients underwent intensive PK sampling  and blood\n\nsamples were taken on cycle 1/day 15 at predose and at 1  2  4  6 \n\n8  10  and 24 hours after dosing  then at predose on cycle 2/day 15 \n\nFor this subset  plasma concentration-time data obtained after study\n\ndrug administration on cycle 1/day 15 were analyzed using non-\n\ncompartmental analysis methods to determine the following PK\n\nparameters  Cmax  tmax  AUCs  and CL/F  For assessment of palboci-\n\nclib plasma Ctrough  blood samples from all patients were collected on\n\nday 15 of cycles 1 and 2 before giving study drug  Plasma samples\n\nwere analyzed for palbociclib concentrations using a validated HPLC\n\nmethod with tandem mass spectrometry at PPD Development  Rich-\n\nmond  VA  USA  Lower limit of quantification for palbociclib was\n\n1 00 ng/mL \n\nMASUDA ET AL  | 805\n\n\n\n2 4 3 | Safety\n\nSafety was assessed by treatment-related AEs and clinically signifi-\n\ncant changes in physical examination findings or abnormal laboratory\n\nassessments  AEs were reported throughout the study using Med-\n\nDRA version 18 1  International Council for Harmonisation  Geneva \n\nSwitzerland  and protocol-specified clusters of preferred terms \n\nbased on incidence  severity  using Common Terminology Criteria for\n\nAdverse Events  version 4 0  and investigator-assessed relationship\n\nto study treatment  Physical examinations and 12-lead ECGs were\n\ncarried out at baseline  day 1 of each cycle  and at the end of treat-\n\nment  Laboratory assessments  hematology and blood chemistry \n\nwere conducted at baseline  days 1 and 15 of cycle 1  and on day 1\n\nof each subsequent cycle \n\n2 5 | Statistical analyses\n\nPrimary endpoint of this study was the 1-year PFS probability of the\n\nlower limit of the 90% CI exceeding 40%  which would correspond\n\nto a median PFS of 9 months  assuming that PFS had an exponential\n\ndistribution  Sample size for this study was 32 patients to meet the\n\nabove criteria with a >80% probability based on the assumption that\n\nmedian PFS for patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole was\n\n18 months  Accounting for a 20% potential patient drop-out  total\n\nenrollment target was 40 patients \n\nThe FAS  defined as all patients who received ≥1 dose of palbociclib \n\nwas used for all efficacy analyses  Primary endpoint of 1-year PFS was\n\ndefined as the proportion of patients without PFS events  ie  PD or\n\ndeath from any cause  at 12 months after the first palbociclib dose  PFS\n\nand 90% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method \n\nSubgroup analyses of PFS were carried out to investigate the\n\neffects of baseline disease characteristics  ie  visceral vs non-visceral\n\nmetastases  length of disease-free interval since completion of prior\n\ntreatment [≤12 months vs >12 months vs de novo metastatic dis-\n\nease]  Exploratory analysis of the association between baseline Ki-\n\n67 status  ie  Ki-67-positive cells ≤20% vs >20%  central laboratory\n\nassessed  and PFS was also conducted  All subgroup analyses of\n\nPFS  median PFS  and 95% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-\n\nMeier method \n\nObjective response rate and DCR were estimated  DOR was\n\nbased on the subset of patients in the FAS who had an objective\n\nresponse  CR or PR  and was defined as the time from first objective\n\nresponse to first objective PD or death  OS was estimated using the\n\nKaplan-Meier method  and 1-year OS was calculated in the same\n\nway as for 1-year PFS \n\nThe PK analysis set was defined as all patients with ≥1 PK\n\nparameter of primary interest in ≥1 PK sampling period  PK parame-\n\nters are presented using descriptive statistics  For the full palbociclib\n\nPK profile subset  n = 6  plasma concentration-time data obtained\n\nafter giving palbociclib on cycle 1/day 15 were also summarized\n\ndescriptively and are presented graphically  Steady-state palbociclib\n\nCtrough values for all patients were calculated as geometric mean and\n\ngeometric %CV \n\nThe study is still ongoing for the collection of survival data \n\n3 | RESULTS\n\n3 1 | Patient disposition\n\nForty-three patients were enrolled at 16 centers in Japan  and\n\npatient accrual for this study was conducted between June 24  2014\n\nand February 9  2015  Of the 43 enrolled

mg daily  3/1 schedule  plus letrozole\n\n2 5 mg daily resulted in a 1-year PFS probability of 75 0%  90% CI \n\n61 3%-84 4%  at the time of the initial March 4  2016 data cutoff \n\nThus  the expected efficacy of palbociclib plus letrozole was\n\nobserved because the lower limit of the 90% CI exceeded 40%  At\n\nthe later October 31  2016 data cutoff  1-year PFS probability was\n\n75 6%  90% CI  62 4%-84 7%  The 1-year PFS probability in this\n\nstudy was similar to the results in the PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-2\n\nstudies 21 Median PFS in patients in the PALOMA-1 study was\n\n20 2 months  95% CI  13 8-27 5  and in the PALOMA-2 trial it was\n\n24 8 months  22 1–NE  after a median follow up of 29 6 and\n\n23 months  respectively 14 15 The median PFS was not reached by\n\nthe primary

by BC still lack data from Latin populations\nof Hispanic origin  In this pilot study  metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed\nto establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC  Data\nfrom 1H-NMR  GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared  Statistics showed dis-\ncrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms  The dif-\nferentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid  amino acid and\nfatty acid metabolism  This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches\nin metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabo-\nlism  Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better\nunderstanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic\norigin  Particularly  the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines\nand the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid  cPA  In addition  the mapped meta-\nbolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-His-\npanic women  despite racial differences \n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer  BC  remains the most frequent type of cancer and the main cause of cancer\n\ndeaths among women worldwide [1]  According to GLOBOCAN  breast cancer mortality\n\nrates in developed countries have declined in the last years  but the incidence rates continues\n\nto rise  especially in Latin America and other developing regions [1  2]  Mortality reduction\n\nhas been associated with the advances in medical diagnostic methods and the development of\n\nnew therapies  however  the high heterogeneity of breast cancer still poses challenges to the\n\nunderstanding of its characteristic phenotype  Reported findings of breast cancer have sug-\n\ngested prognosis and predictive biomarkers based on alterations in genes  e g  BRCA1 and\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10

\n\nMetabolomics is a consolidated field that has enabled to observe differences in metabolic\n\nsignatures generated by a pathological state such as cancer  These differences allow to postulate\n\nmolecular mechanisms involved in cancer  proposing and evaluating promissory treatment\n\ntargets and diagnosis tools [8–10]  Although the identification of breast cancer biomarkers by\n\nmetabolomics is still at an early stage  exploratory studies have allowed highlighting alterations\n\nin aerobic glycolysis  de novo lipogenesis  glutaminolysis  glycerolipid  glycerophospholipid\nand amino acid metabolism [11–15]  These alterations have been used to identify metabolic\n\nchanges associated with advanced metastatic breast cancer in cell lines [16  17] and serum\n\n[18]  as well as breast cancer subtypes in plasma [13  19] and tissue [13  19–21]  Moreover  the\n\nidentification of suitable targets for drug development in cell lines [22–24] and therapy selec-\n\ntion in cell lines [25] and serum [26] have also been achieved \n\nHigh-throughput analytical chemical techniques such as chromatography coupled to mass\n\nspectrometry  MS  and nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  spectroscopy [27  28] have been\n\nused in metabolomics  along with univariate and multivariate statistics [29  30]  in order to\n\nprovide information on a large number of metabolites  in particular those with altered levels\n\nbetween healthy subjects and cancer patients [9  31–34]  Metabolomics in BC has been mainly\n\nperformed by NMR and MS  according to the purpose of the study and the characteristics of\n\nmeasured metabolites [35]  NMR has proven useful to determine significant differences in\n\nserum samples  allowing a discrimination between early and metastatic BC  regarding to\n\namino acid  small organic molecules and general lipid content [26  36  37]  and also to predict\n\nBC recurrence using amino acid  fatty acid and choline levels [38]  Both GC-MS and LC-MS\n\nhave detected alterations that have been proposed for several biomarkers  including amino\n\nacids [38–41]  small organic acids [13  38] and fatty acids [26  38]  whereas lysophospholipid\n\n[42  43] and carnitine [13] alterations have been found only by LC-MS  In addition  alterations\n\nin less polar lipids  such as glycerophospholipids [42  44  45] and glycerolipids [43  46] have\n\nbeen reported by LC-MS using a lipidomics approach \n\nIn last decades  extensive research in breast cancer has been conducted in order to under-\n\nstand its heterogeneity  however a comprehensive metabolic profile is still required to identify\n\npromising underlying metabolic signatures that can be used to improve breast cancer diagno-\n\nsis and treatment  Besides  most studies of metabolic alterations in BC have been performed\n\non Asian  European and North American women  little is known about the metabolic signa-\n\nture of BC in women from developing regions  In the present pilot study  a multiplatform\n\nmetabolomic and lipidomic approach based on NMR  GC-MS and LC-MS was performed\n\ntowards mapping breast cancer metabolic perturbations in Colombian Hispanic

set at 250˚C and the split ratio to 1 10  The temperature\n\ngradient program started at 60˚C held for 1 min  followed by a subsequent increase in temper-\n\nature to 320˚C at a rate of 10˚C/min  The GC-MS transfer line  filament source and the quad-\n\nrupole temperature were set at 280  230 and 150˚C  respectively  The electron ionization  EI \n\nsource was set at 70 eV and the mass spectrometer was operated in full scan mode applying a\n\nmass range from m/z 50 to 600 at a scan rate of 1 38 scan/s \n\nMetabolic fingerprinting by LC-MS analysis\n\nPlasma deproteinization and metabolite extraction were performed using the protocol pub-\n\nlished by Ciborowski et al  [48]  The plasma  40 μL  was mixed with a cold mixture of metha-\nnol/ethanol  1 1  −20˚C  in a ratio of 1 3  MF by LC-MS was performed using an HPLC system\n1200 series coupled to Q-TOF 6520  Agilent Technologies  Santa Clara  CA  USA  Ten micro-\n\nliter of sample extract were injected onto a C18 column  Kinetex

\n\nformic acid in water  A  and 0 1%  v/v  formic acid in acetonitrile  B  at a flow rate of 0 3\n\nmL/min  The applied gradient elution program started at 25% B increased then to 95% B in 35\n\nmin  returned to initial conditions in 1 min and was kept constant for 9 min to ensure re-equil-\n\nibration of the column  Data were collected in both positive and negative electrospray ioniza-\n\ntion  ESI  modes in separate runs  using the conditions previously described [48]  During all\n\nanalysis  two reference masses were continuously injected for mass correction  m/z 121 0509\n C5H4N4  and m/z 922 0098  C18H18O6N3P3F24  for positive ionization mode and m/z\n112 9856  C2O2F3 NH4  and m/z 1033 9881  C18H18O6N3P3F24  for negative ionization\nmode \n\nMetabolic fingerprinting by NMR analysis\n\nPlasma samples for NMR analysis were prepared according to the procedure published by\n\nDona et al [49]  In short  D2O phosphate buffer pH 7 4  0 075M Na2HPO4 7H2O  with 3-tri-\n\nmethylsilyl propionic acid  TSP   350 μL  was added to heparin containing plasma samples\n 350 μL  The mixture was centrifuged and transferred into NMR tubes  1H-NMR spectra\nwere acquired using a Bruker UltraShield 400 MHz spectrometer  Bruker Biospin  Karlsruhe \n\nGermany  Samples were measured at 300 K employing two NMR experiments  First  a water\n\nsuppression using pre-saturation pulses  zgpr  25Hz  was carried out using the standard pulse\n\nsequence [RD—P 90˚ –AQ]  Thereafter  a Carr-Purcell-Miboom-Gill  CPMG  pulse sequence\n\nwas applied with a receiver gain of 90 5  a total mixing time of 78 ms  126 loops  4 dummy\n\nscans and 64 free induction decay  FID  FIDs were multiplied by a 0 3 Hz exponential func-\n\ntion prior to Fourier transform and only zero-order phase correction was allowed [50] \n\nLipid fingerprinting by LC-MS analysis\n\nPlasma lipids were extracted using methyl tert-butyl ether  MTBE  as previously reported by\n\nWhiley et al  [51]  In short  plasma  20 μL  was vortex-mixed with MTBE/methanol  10 2 \nmixture  deionized water  250 μL  was added and the upper phase containing the plasma lipid\nfraction was transferred into vials for

and\n\nkept constant for 4 min before the gradient could return to its initial conditions in 1 min and\n\nheld there for 14 min to enable column re-equilibration  Mass spectrometric detection was\n\nperformed in both positive and negative ionization mode as previously described by Whiley\n\net al  [51]  Throughout the analysis  the same reference masses were used as described in the\n\nsection on MF analysis \n\nQuality control samples\n\nQuality control  QC  samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of plasma from each\n\nBCP and CP sample  Subsequently  profiles from the QC samples were recorded following the\n\nsame procedures as described above for each technique  To determine the reproducibility of\n\nplasma sample preparation and the stability of the analytical platforms used  several QC runs\n\nwere performed prior to the analysis of all plasma samples until system equilibration was\n\nachieved  QC plasma samples were also analyzed after every five randomized plasma samples\n\n[52] \n\nData treatment\n\nGC-MS data treatment consisted in data deconvolution and metabolite identification using\n\nAgilent MassHunter Unknowns Analysis B 07 00  Fiehn version 2008 and NIST 14 libraries \n\nThereafter  retention time alignment was performed using Agilent Mass Profiler Professional\n\nB 12 1 software  and the results were exported to Agilent MassHunter Quantitative B 07 00 in\n\norder to perform the integration of each metabolite  Raw LC-MS data was treated with Agilent\n\nMassHunter Profinder Software B 06 00 using Molecular Feature Extraction  MFE  and subse-\n\nquent Recursive Feature Extraction  RFE  algorithms for noise reduction  feature deconvolu-\n\ntion and alignment  Finally  alignment and integration of the features by GC-MS and LC-MS\n\nwere manually inspected and exported to Excel  Microsoft  to filter by presence and reproduc-\n\nibility  keeping only the metabolites detected in at least 80% of all plasma samples and a coeffi-\n\ncient of variation  CV %  of less than 30% of the same metabolite detected in the QC samples\n\n[53] \n\nFor NMR data treatment  the spectral range was set 0 5 to 8 5  in which the spectral regions\n\nof water  4 7 to 4 9 ppm  and TSP  -0 20 to 0 20ppm  were excluded  Data were segmented\n\nand reduced by binning method with a window of 0 04 ppm and stored as a data matrix \n\nStatistical analysis\n\nSignificant differences between plasma samples fingerprints from BCP and CP obtained within\n\neach technique  were evaluated by multivariate  MVA  and univariate  UVA  statistical analy-\n\nsis  MVA were performed using SIMCA-P+ 12 0  Umetrics  Umea  Sweden  Unsupervised\n\nprincipal component analysis  PCA  was first used to evaluate the quality of the analytical sys-\n\ntem performance using the QC samples  Then  a supervised method  orthogonal partial least\n\nsquares regression  OPLS-DA  was performed to maximize differences between BCP and CP \n\nand for the selection of the variables responsible for the separation between the two different\n\ngroups  Pareto scaling and logarithmic transformation were used before the statistical analysis \n\nThe accuracy of the classification was assessed by means of a double cross-validation scheme \n\nThe original data set was split into a training  test and external set before any step of statistical\n\nanalysis  The number of OPLS components were chosen on the basis of a 7-fold cross-valida-\n\ntion that was performed on the training set only  and the best model was used to predict

Evolutionary\nWavelet Neural Networks have been employed to develop cancer prediction models  The\npresent study proposes to use ensembles of Evolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks  The\nsearch for a high quality ensemble is directed by a fitness function that incorporates the\naccuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself  The\nensemble approach is tested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets \none on Breast Cancer and two on Parkinson’s disease  using a 10-fold cross-validation\nstrategy  Our experimental results show that  for the first dataset  the performance was simi-\nlar to previous studies reported in literature  On the second dataset  the Evolutionary Wave-\nlet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous methods  The third\ndataset is relatively new and this study is the first to report benchmark results \n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Australian women [1] \n\nwhile Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurological condition in Australia [2] \n\nThe identification and assessment process for both diseases is multi-staged  that is tedious \n\ntime-consuming  and challenging where data needs to be manually labeled  Such assessments\n\nmight also lead to misdiagnosis  In medical practice  in order to reduce the risk of misdiagno-\n\nsis  opinions from multiple doctors  or specialist doctors  are taken into account  A similar\n\napproach is used in the computational intelligence domain  where performance of prediction\n\nmodels  or specialist models  is improved by combining multiple models  thus creating an\n\nensemble of classifiers [3] \n\nEnsemble classifiers and their use have been an active area of research for the past two\n\ndecades  with Bagging [3] and Boosting [4] being two popular techniques  particularly in the\n\nfield of applied statistics  pattern recognition and machine learning [5–7]  Many of the predic-\n\ntion models have been improved by using ensembles of support vector machines [8  9]  latent\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0192192 February 8  2018 1 /

method for training\n\nWNNs and have been used to generate models for breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease classi-\n\nfication [15]  However  there have been no studies on the prediction performance of an ensem-\n\nble of EWNN classifiers  yet \n\nThe motivation of this research is to evaluate the performance of EWNN and ensembles of\n\nEWNNs  EWNN-e  and compare them with other ensemble techniques used on the same\n\ndata reported in literature  The findings of this paper aim to provide future researchers an\n\nalternative and effective model to compare with  Moreover  this study also investigates a newly\n\npublished Parkinson’s disease dataset with multiple speech recordings \n\nThe paper is organized as follows  Background provides an overview to Wavelet Neural\n\nNetworks and its structure  EWNN and its response to a two-spiral task  related work on prun-\n\ning ensembles  and description of some of the performance measures used in our study  The\n\nbiomedical datasets  proposed mechanism and the experimental setup are described in the\n\nExperimental Methodology section  Results & Discussion presents the outcome of experiments\n\nand compares the method’s effectiveness with other techniques reported in literature  That sec-\n\ntion is then followed by the conclusions and future work \n\nBackground\nWavelet Neural Networks\n\nWavelet Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that combine the theory of wavelets\n\nand neural networks [16]  In standard neural networks  weights and biases are the only param-\n\neters that are trained and the most common activation functions used are sigmoid  hyperbolic\n\ntangent and linear functions  The activation functions found in WNNs are those that belong to\n\nthe family of wavelet basis functions  with the most common being the Morelet and Mexican\nhat  In addition to weights and biases  three other parameters are used in WNNs  translate \ndilate and rotate  The use of standard gradient methods to adjust WNN parameters  in particu-\n\nlar the weights  biases  the translate and dilate parameters  often resulted in premature conver-\n\ngence [16  17]  For that reason  global optimization approaches  such as genetic algorithms\n\nand evolutionary programming techniques  have been used in applications such as air and\n\nground traffic flow [18  19]  energy consumption [20]  large scale function estimation [21] \n\nfunction approximation [22] and power transformer monitoring [23]  A diagram of a WNN is\n\nshown in Fig 1  WNNs generally have a feed-forward structure  with one hidden layer having\n\nm wavelons  ψm  and a neuron in the output layer  There are also n shortcut connections from\nthe inputs to the output neuron \n\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks\n\nEWNNs were first proposed by Khan et al  [15] as a method for optimizing all WNN parame-\n\nters concurrently  The method was tested successfully on both simulated and real datasets [15] \n\nFor a detailed description of EWNN characteristics and performance  we refer the reader to\n\nreference [15] \n\nFig 2 is an example of the EWNN applied to a standard benchmark two-spiral task shown\n\nin Fig 2 a  Two-spiral is a non-linear task with two spirals  shown as black and white dots \n\neach with 97 sample data points in a 2D Cartesian space [24  25]  The two-spiral task is fairly a\n\nEvolutionary

authors have declared\n\nthat no competing interests exist \n\n\n\n\nchallenging problem where for an Artificial Neural Network  ANN  with architecture 2-5-5-5-\n\n1 took 10 000–20 000 epochs in [24]  While in [26] a 2-50-1 ANN was trained by employing a\n\nsecond-order Newton optimization method where training took only 650 epochs  In contrast \n\nfor EWNNs with a wavelet activation function of Morelet shown in Fig 2 b  the optimum\n\nresponse of the EWNNs was achieved within 9 generations and with two wavelons only  This\n\nindicates its potential to separate non-linear classes effectively and efficiently \n\nClassifier ensembles and pruning\n\nThe role of a classifier C is to learn how to map the feature set to a set of class label s  The data\nsamples are divided into training U and test V sets  The C is first trained on U where it learns\nthe mapping process and then the performance of the C is measured on V  A multiple classifier\nsystem  or ensemble  Ens  is composed of a set of base classifiers that are trained on the same\ntraining dataset  and combined in a manner that improves the classification performance of\n\nthe system  There are two main methods for creating an ensemble  averaging and voting [27] \n\nAveraging is normally used for classifiers with numeric outputs  While voting is used for\n\nFig 1  Structure of a Wavelet Neural Network  The network has n

selective ensembles  ensemble selection and ensemble thinning are all\n\ndifferent names given to the same task—reducing ensemble sizes  Pruned ensembles exhibit\n\nbetter performance and robustness with lower computational and memory costs [28]  com-\n\npared to traditional ensemble techniques [29  30]  The three most popular ensemble pruning\n\ntechniques are ranking  clustering and optimization [31]  and this study focuses on the latter \n\nAmong the optimization techniques for ensemble pruning the most commonly used are evolu-\n\ntionary algorithms  semi-definite programming and hill climbing [32–34] \n\nGASEN-b was one of the earliest algorithms for ensemble pruning  and was introduced by\n\n[32]  The ensemble is represented as a bit string  with each decision tree model using a bit  The\n\nbit string representation provides a direct mechanism of adding or removing classifiers  as\n\nopposed to a weighting mechanism with a predefined threshold  A similar approach was also\n\nused in [6] to select/remove classifiers from a heterogeneous pool of networks \n\nZhang et al  [33] chose a quadratic integer programming approach for pruning  The weights\n\nwere kept binary and the size of the final ensemble was prefixed  In terms of computational\n\ncomplexity  the algorithm could run in polynomial time \n\nHill climbing methods generally use either forward selection or backward elimination of\n\nclassifiers  and include various performance measures  e g  diversity  weighted accuracy [35–\n\n39]  More recently  human-like foresight has been used as a measure to prune ensembles via\n\nhill climbing [34] \n\nIn this study  a pool of optimized EWNNs is pruned using genetic algorithms so that a\n\nbetter prediction model is obtained  The approach follows the GASEN-b mechanism [32]\n\nof pruning classifiers directly through bits so that to reduce the amount of parameter\n\ntuning  Our method introduces a fitness function that involves the sum of two

binary classification problems available in the liter-\n\nature  Power [40] investigated those measures and generalized them for multiclass problems \n\nNext  we present the measures used in this work \n\n• Training Accuracy  Tracc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the training set U \n\n• Test Accuracy  Teacc  fraction of correctly classified samples in the test set V  This is also\nknown as the classification accuracy  and expressed as Teacc =  TP + TN / P + N  TP repre-\nsents true positive cases  i e  accurate classification of control  non-diseased  samples  TN\n\nrepresents true negative cases  i e  accurate classification of diseased samples  and  P + N  is\nthe total number of positive and negative test samples \n\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network

fraction of true positive cases  mathematically\nexpressed as Sens = TP/ TP + FN  FN is the number of false negatives and reflects the more\nserious mistake of classifying a disease sample as control \n\n• Specificity  Spec  measurement of the fraction of true negative cases  mathematically repre-\nsented as Spec = TN/ TN + FP  FP reflects the misclassification of control samples as dis-\neased ones \n\n• Mathew’s Correlation Coefficient  MCC  is a balanced measure of quality for binary classifi-\ncation problems  normally used if classes are unbalanced  The measure was introduced in\n\n[41]

at\n\n43 5 micron per pixel spatial resolution were downloaded and extracted via the chain code \n\nThat dataset had an equal number of benign and malignant samples  Even though [48] derived\n\n25 features from the extracted region  only 6 of the features were actually investigated in the\n\npresent study  in order to provide a fair comparison with previous works that used the same\n\ndataset [11  49]  Among those 6 features  there are 4 BIRADS  Breast Imaging Reporting and\n\nData System established by [50]  lexicon features  mass shape  mass margin  assessment  breast\ndensity  specified

http //archive ics uci edu/\n\nml  was acquired from the online machine learning database repository from the University of\n\nCalifornia at Irvine  UCI  [51  52]  It is a challenging  imbalanced dataset that has been investi-\n\ngated previously by several researchers [9  53–55]  It contains 195 samples  each with 22 differ-\n\nent biomedical voice measurements  These voice measurements were

individuals are diagnosed with Par-\n\nkinson’s disease and the other half represents control subjects \n\nTraining and test sets\n\nFor all the datasets  the data was divided into 90% training and 10% test data  The proposed\n\napproach is divided into two main phases as shown in Fig 3  Phase I creates optimal EWNNs\n\nfrom cross validation folds conducted on the 90% training and validation data and the average\n\nclassification accuracy Teacc for the EWNNs was reported  The optimal EWNNs were then\nused by next phase  Phase II uses genetic algorithm to prune the optimal EWNN classifiers\n\nwhere the separate test set was used and a final ensemble classification accuracy ETeacc was\nthen reported \n\nIn both LPD and SPD datasets  individuals had different numbers of records  Thus  if more\n\nthan half of the individual’s records are classified as Parkinson’s disease  then the individual\n\nitself is classified as Parkinson’s disease  diseased  This approach was adopted from [45  54] in\n\norder to avoid over-fitting  as the frequency response of the records of the same patient are\n\npotentially very similar \n\nApproach\n\nPhase I  Generating optimized EWNNs \n\n1  EWNN initialization  An EWNN genome requires the initialization of the number of wave-\n\nlons  the different parameters of each wavelon  and the wavelet function s \n\n• The number of wavelons is critical as too many wavelons would likely result in over-fitting\n\nand too few would not capture the variability of the data [56]  The three datasets have been\n\ninvestigated in detail under different parameter settings and those are reported in [15] \n\nThe best configurations from that study were adopted here  The number of wavelons used\n\nfor each dataset is shown in Table 2 \n\n• Selection of an appropriate activation function depends on the data itself  but the Mexican\n\nhat wavelet has performed satisfactorily in many applications [56]  For the DDSM  the\n\npresent study uses a heterogeneous WNN with four possible activation functions  For the\n\nremaining case studies  we used a homogeneous WNN that uses the Mexican hat wavelet\n\nas activation function \n\n• Each wavelon is represented by matrices of inputs xn 2 [1  Feat]  switches cn 2 {0  1} where\n0/1 indicates non-connected/connected features  respectively  input weights wxnm 2 [−1 \n+1]  scale parameters αnm 2 [0  1]  translation parameters βnm 2 [−1  +1]  rotation\nparameters Rnm 2 [−1  +1]  as well as categorical values representing the type of wavelet\nfunction ψm 2 [1

initialized uniformly at random  within the corresponding\n\nranges of possible values \n\n2  Population Size  There are two basic types of evolutionary strategies   μ  λ -ES and  μ + λ -\nES [57]  μ represents the parent population and λ refers to the number of offspring pro-\nduced in a generation  In  μ  λ -ES  offspring replaces the parents as the μ fittest are selected\n\nFig 3  Flowchart of the two phases of the approach  Phase I is the process of generating optimized EWNNs  Phase II\n\nuses the optimized EWNNs to generate the ensemble of EWNNs \n\nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone

The value of μ and λ used for the different case studies are shown in\nTable 2 \n\n3  Fitness evaluation  All individuals in the population are evaluated and sorted based on their\n\naccuracies and mean square error where the best individual is promoted as parent to the\n\nnext generation  The purpose of using two dimensional sorting is to promote networks\n\nwith uncorrelated evaluation metrics in generations ahead \n\n4  Mutation  A 1% mutation rate is used to generate new EWNNs  similar to [15]  Mutation\n\noccurs in three different ways  For continuous parameters  such as input weights  wavelon\n\nweights  translation  rotation  dilation parameters and the bias  values are perturbed by add-\n\ning a small percentage of the current value  For binary parameters  e g  switch  the value is\n\ninverted from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0  For the third type of mutation  a network input is randomly\n\nchanged to another input feature in the feature list  or similarly  a wavelet function is ran-\n\ndomly changed to another wavelet function in the list \n\n5  Termination condition  The simulations stop at 2 000 generations  We observed that this\n\nvalue is sufficient for the evolutionary process to converge to a high-quality solution  The\n\noptimal EWNNs are later used in Phase II to create the ensembles  A total of 50 indepen-\n\ndent evolutionary runs were executed for each of the cross-validation folds \n\nPhase II  Genetic algorithm-based ensemble \n\nGiven the set of optimized EWNN ensembles  the next step is to prune them  This stage uses\n\nanother genetic algorithm as follows \n\n1  Chromosome Chr representation  A k-bit string is used to represent an ensemble with the\noptimized EWNNs  A bit value of 1 indicates that the classifier is actively used in the ensem-\n\nble  0 otherwise \n\n2  Population size  After a number of preliminary tests  we decided for an  μ+λ -evolutionary\nstrategy with μ = 3 parents and λ = 25 offspring in each generation  For ensemble pruning \nhaving 3 parents considerably reduced the risk of premature convergence and at the same\n\ntime kept the evolutionary process under a reasonable selective pressure \n\n3  Fitness evaluation  The fitness value of each chromosome is evaluated as in Eq 2  It is an\n\naverage of the individual accuracies Tracc of the active EWNNs and their ensemble training\naccuracy Ens U  where the objective is to maximize the average accuracies \n\nFEðChrÞ ¼ 0 5ðTracc þ EnsðUÞÞ ð2Þ\n\n4  Mutation  After pilot tests  mutation rate was set to 1% for all simulations  and the strategy\n\nused was bit-swap \n\n5  Termination condition  The limit for the number of generations was set at 1 000  Ensemble\n\naccuracy was found not to improve after few hundred generations \n\nThe program starts with random chromosomes that are evaluated based on the fitness func-\n\ntion in Eq 2  The best individuals are selected as parents and thus preserved for the next gener-\n\nation—all other individuals are removed  Then  λ offspring are produced by mutating the\nparents  Every offspring is evaluated and added to the next generation  The process continues\n\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease prediction\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0192192 February 8  2018 8 / 15\n\n\n\n\nuntil the number of generations limit is reached  The best parent’s ensemble accuracy ETeacc\non the test set is then reported \n\nResults and discussion\nDid the ensemble of EWNNs perform better  The performance of the evolutionary ensemble\n\nmethod is shown in Table 3  Classification accuracy Teacc  ensemble classification accuracy\nETeacc  sensitivity Sens  specificity Spec and Mathew correlation coefficient MCC are reported\nfor the three datasets  The ensemble approach improves the classification accuracy by up to\n\n23 7 percentage points  Teacc vs  ETeacc  compared to individual EWNN classifiers  For the\nDDSM dataset  the ensemble approach improved the performance of the network from 89 0%\n\nto 95 5%  An MCC score of 91 0% also indicates a very high classification accuracy  For the\n\nLPD dataset the accuracy increased from 92 9% to 100%  and for the SPD dataset it increased\n\nfrom 66 3% to 90 0% \n\nWhat were the significant features identified by the process  Fig 4 is the averaged connected\n\nfeatures for all datasets  across 50 independent runs in EWNN  and the number of active classi-\n\nfiers in the EWNN-e  In a standard WNN all features are connected to every wavelons in the\n\nhidden layer  While in EWNNs  from Fig 4  there is some variability in how often these fea-\n\ntures are connected  This indicates the flexibility of pruning features  during training  at the\n\nhidden layer  as opposed to the input layer  for which many feature reduction methods already\n\nexist  For the DDSM dataset  mass margin  patient age  mass shape and assessment were the top\nfour features that had an impact on performance—similarly to [48]  For the LPD dataset \n\nspread1 and D2 were the top two features—similarly to [53]  The trend of feature selection was\nfound to be same for both the EWNN and EWNN-e networks for all datasets except SPD  For\n\nthe SPD dataset  Shimmerapq3 is the top feature in the ensemble network  whereas Shimmerdda\nis the top one for the individual EWNNs  This drift in frequency of feature selection indicates\n\npossible significance of the feature in the ensemble domain \n\nShould every wavelon be fully connected  The connectivity or dimensionality of a wavelon\n\nis determined by the number of active or connected inputs  Fig 5 displays the sum of the wave-\n\nlons’ dimensions for each dataset  over 50 independent runs and  over the number of active\n\nclassifiers in the final EWNN-e  across the 10 folds  The frequency of each wavelon dimension\n\nis lower in the ensemble network  as classifiers are pruned  The ensemble networks exhibited\n\ndifferent trends  depending on the dataset  Interestingly  for the DDSM dataset we observed a\n\nreduction in the number of 6-dimensional wavelons  thus indicating that fully connected\n\nEWNNs were not part of the ensemble network  The frequent occurrence of wavelons with\n\nlower dimensions indicates that WNNs should be given the flexibility to adjust their input  in\n\ncontrast to a standard WNNs  where all inputs are connected [16] \n\nHow many classifiers are necessary to create an effective ensemble  The average number of\n\nEWNNs in the ensemble networks for the datasets is shown in Table 4  The ensemble networks\n\ncombine around 1/3  14-17  of the 50 available EWNNs  and they improved both speed and\n\nperformance  compared to the non-ensemble approach \n\nFrom Table 5  it can be concluded that the proposed method generated either competitive\n\nor better results in comparison to existing techniques  An advantage of EWNN-e is that it does\n\nnot require pre-processing for feature pruning  which is present in some of the comparison\n\nmethods  Given the results  it can be stated that the ensemble version of EWNN classifiers is a\n\nsuitable approach for predictive analysis  Just for clarification purposes  and to put the results\n\ninto context  for the DDSM dataset  the accuracy reported for NN-e was achieved with an\n\nensemble of 127 classifiers [11]  as opposed to the average of only 14 50 in the proposed\n\nEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles for breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease prediction\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0192192 February 8  2018 9 / 15\n\n\n\n\nmethod  That is  NN-e has a better performance for that dataset  but the classifier is much\n\nmore complex than the classifiers obtained by our approach \n\nConclusion\nEnsemble approaches aim at combining the classification power of individual classifiers ulti-\n\nmately improving the overall performance of the system  The current study contributes to the\n\nTable 3  Performance of the ensemble EWNN on the different case studies  Notice the increase in accuracy of the classifiers

did not play a role in the study design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshowed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy  inhibiting tumor growth as detected by ultrasonog-\nraphy and bioluminescence imaging  The TTAC-10 group also showed the lowest viable\ntumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index in histopathologic analyses \n\nConclusion\nWe firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001 effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascu-\nlarization in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model  It may provide a future treatment option\nfor breast cancer \n\nIntroduction\nTumor angiogenesis is a potential target for anti-cancer therapy  as it plays an essential role in\n\noxygen and nutrient supply [1  2]  Antibodies against either vascular endothelial growth fac-\n\ntors  VEGFs  or their receptors have been developed to target tumor angiogenesis [3  4]  Beva-\n\ncizumab  the first approved anti-angiogenic agent to target VEGF itself  achieved notable\n\nsuccess as a novel targeted drug to treat several cancers  including colon  renal  and non-small\n\ncell lung cancer  Although its therapeutic efficacy is limited  it is generally used as part of a\n\ncombination treatment regimen \n\nTargeting VEGF receptors  VEGFRs  is an alternative approach to inhibit angiogenesis in\n\ntumors  In particular  inhibition of the VEGFR-2/kinase insert domain receptor  KDR  has\n\npotential anti-angiogenic effects because VEGFR-2 is the major signaling regulator of VEGF/\n\nVEGFR pathways [5]  From this perspective  TTAC-0001  a human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR\n\nmonoclonal antibody  was developed  TTAC-0001 binds to the VEGF-binding domain of\n\nVEGFR-2 and neutralizes the biological activity of VEGFR-2 by blocking the binding of VEGF\n\n[6]  Preclinical research revealed potential anti-tumor activity of TTAC-0001 in colorectal \n\nnon-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma tumor models [6–10]  Recently  a phase I clinical\n\ntrial of TTAC-0001 was completed  and a phase IIa trial is ongoing  However  there have been\n\nno previous studies of TTAC-0001 for breast cancer \n\nIn terms of chemotherapy for breast cancer  the major challenge is to develop an effective\n\nregimen for triple-negative breast cancer [11]  Bevacizumab had been incorporated as a\n\nsecond-line chemotherapy regimen for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer  but was\n\nrevoked by the FDA due to inadequate therapeutic effect  suggesting that targeting the\n\nVEGF ligand itself may not be the best strategy [12  13]  Therefore  an alternative approach \n\ninhibition of VEGFR-2/KDR  is worthy of investigation for treatment of triple-negative\n\nbreast cancer \n\nBioimaging plays important roles in anti-cancer drug research [14  15]  Multiple modalities\n\nsuch as magnetic resonance imaging  positron emission tomography have been applied for the\n\noncologic drug development and each modality showed its own values to facilitate the devel-\n\nopment steps  Particularly  size measurement with ultrasonography  US  provides more accu-\n\nrate values of regressed tumor volumes [16  17] when the drugs are treated and the utilization\n\nof optical imaging  fluorescence and bioluminescence  enables the studies of mode of action\n\nmechanisms and biodistribution of the drugs [18] \n\nThe validation of TTAC-0001 in triple-negative breast cancer has not been performed yet \n\nTherefore  we aimed to investigate the drug mechanism and anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-\n\n0001  a novel anti-angiogenic agent  in a mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-\n\nmodal bioimaging \n\nDrug mechanism and efficacy of TTAC-0001 in mouse breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0187063 January 25  2018 2 / 16\n\ndata collection and

perform fluorescent labeling of TTAC-0001  we used a com-\n\nmercial kit  Alexa Fluor1 647 Antibody Labelling Kit  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Waltham \n\nMA  USA  according to the manufacturer’s protocol  Briefly  we induced a conjugation reac-\n\ntion between the Alexa Fluor1 647 reactive dye and TTAC-0001  and the purified labeled\n\nTTAC-0001 was collected  To determine the degree of labeling  the concentration of the dye\n\nwas calculated based on absorbance at 280 and 650 nm  The collected labeled drug was stabi-\n\nlized at room temperature for 1 h and then intravenously injected into the mice \n\nSerial fluorescence imaging  Biodistribution of Alexa Fluor1 647-labeled TTAC-0001\n\nwas performed using the IVIS Lumina II machine  PerkinElmer  Waltham  MA  USA  Mice\n\nwere anesthetized with 1% isoflurane  Forane1  Choongwae  Korea  and Alexa Fluor1\n\n647-labeled TTAC-0001 was intravenously injected at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg  Serial fluores-\n\ncence images were then acquired at baseline and at 1  2  4  and 8 h and 1  2  4  and 6 days after\n\ndrug injection  Imaging was performed with an exposure time of 1 s and an f/stop of 1  Using\n\nLiving Image1 4 2 software  Caliper Life Sciences  Hopkinton  MA  USA  the peak total sig-\n\nnal was measured by placing regions of interest  ROIs  at the tumors  which reflected the accu-\n\nmulated amount of Alexa Fluor1 647-labeled drug \n\nMode of action for the anti-angiogenic effect\n\nExperimental groups  For evaluating the mode of action  the animals were divided into\n\nfour groups that were treated with vehicle  control group  n = 5  bevacizumab 10 mg/kg\n\n BVZ-10 group  n = 5  low-dose  2 mg/kg  TTAC-0001  TTAC-2 group  n = 5  or high-dose\n\n 10 mg/kg  TTAC-0001  TTAC-10 group  n = 5 \n\nMatrigel plug angiogenesis assay  We used Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay  Corning \n\nNY  USA  to evaluate the in vivo anti-angiogenic effect of TTAC-0001  It is based on the fact\nthat VEGF secreted from Matrigel tumor cells exerts pro-angiogenic effects on the surround-\n\ning tissue  thus promoting neovascular development that is visualized in the Matrigel  If a drug\n\ninhibits the effect of VEGF by inhibiting either VEGF or VEGFR  then the decreased levels of\n\nneovascular development in the Matrigel can be evaluated \n\nFig 1  Flow chart of the experimental protocol of the

the global histogram-derived thresholding\n\nmethod [19]  The percentage area of CD31-positive cells was calculated by dividing the area of\n\nthe CD31-positive cells by the area of the tumor ROI \n\nAnti-tumor efficacy\n\nTo evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the drugs  we used two types of cells and imaging meth-\n\nods as follows   1  MDA-MB-231 cells for ultrasonography  US  evaluation and  2  MDA-MB-\n\n231+luc cells for bioluminescence imaging  BLI  The reason why we used imaging for tumor\n\nmonitoring is that the orthotopic tumors in the mammary fat pad may be barely visible  thus\n\nmaking it very difficult to measure tumor size if the tumor decreases during treatment  In\n\naddition  utilization of both US and BLI modalities allows a more accurate evaluation of the\n\ntumor volume and viability  respectively \n\nExperimental groups  To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the drugs  tumors were\n\nengrafted into 80 mice  Of these  56 mice  70%  that met the tumor volume criteria  70–130\n\nmm3  were selected and randomly assigned to four groups  which were treated with saline\n\n control group  bevacizumab 10 mg/kg  BVZ-10 group  low-dose  2 mg/kg  TTAC-0001\n\n TTAC-2 group  and high-dose  10 mg/kg  TTAC-0001  TTAC-10 group \n\nMice were monitored daily for up to 30 days after treatment for tumor volume  body\n\nweight  and general body condition  such as appearance  food/water intake  respiration  and\n\nambulation  Animals were euthanized when they showed signs of distress  when the tumors\n\nwere>2 cm in diameter  when the weight loss was >15% of body weight  or when the tumor\n\ninterfered with the ability to eat or drink \n\nUltrasonography  All US examinations were performed by a board-certified radiologist\n\n K W K  using an iU22 unit  Philips Healthcare  Bothell  WA  USA  with a 20 MHz linear\n\ntransducer  To assess tumor volume  we measured the longest diameter of the tumor on the\n\naxial and coronal axes and the height of the tumor every 3 days during the 1 month follow-up \n\nWe calculated the tumor volume according to the following formula  4 19 × axial longest\ndiameter × coronal longest diameter × height \n\nBioluminescence imaging  BLI is an established in vivo imaging techniques assessing\n\nassessing angiogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of angiogenesis-directed therapies [20  21] \n\nBLI was performed using the IVIS Lumina II machine  PerkinElmer  Waltham  MA  USA \n\nMice were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane  Forane1  Choongwae  Korea  then D-Luciferin\n\n Caliper Life Sciences

1  and pixel binning of\n\n8  over 20 min  The BLI was performed at baseline  i e  2 h before injecting therapeutic agents \n\nand after treatment  every 5 days during the 1 month follow-up  Using Living Image1 4 2\n\nsoftware  Caliper Life Sciences  Hopkinton  MA  USA  we measured the total flux  photons/s \n\nof the tumor bioluminescence signal by placing an ROI at the tumor \n\nHistopathologic study  All animals were euthanized at day 30 after treatment  The\n\nextracted tumors were perfused with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS \n\nTumors were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm at the largest\ntumor area \n\nTo evaluate the tumor morphology and extent of viable tumor  hematoxylin and eosin\n\n H&E  staining was performed  In representative sections of the tumor  H&E images were ana-\n\nlyzed using NIH-Image J software  The viable tumor cells were regarded as cells stained with\n\nH&E in both the nucleus and cytoplasm  whereas necrotic/apoptotic areas were regarded as\n\ncells stained with eosin only or no stain  After drawing ROIs around the whole tumor  viable\n\ncells were selected based on the hematoxylin staining of the nuclei using the global histogram-\n\nderived thresholding method [19]  The percentage of viable tumor area was calculated by\n\ndividing the area of viable cells by the whole tumor area \n\nTo evaluate the microvessel areas  immunohistochemical staining for a vascular endothelial\n\nantigen  CD31  was performed using a primary rabbit anti-mouse CD31 antibody  BD Phar-\n\nmingen  San Diego  CA  USA  and a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody  1 1000  Molecular\n\nProbes  Eugene  OR  USA  The images of immunohistochemical stains were analyzed using\n\nNIH-Image J software to calculate microvessel area  In the tumor ROI  microvessels were\n\nselected based on areas of CD31-positive cells [19]  The percentage microvessel area was calcu-\n\nlated by dividing the area of CD31-positive cells by the area of the tumor ROI \n\nTo evaluate tumor cell proliferation  i e  the Ki-67 index  immunohistochemical stating\n\nfor Ki-67 was performed using an anti-mouse Ki-67 antibody  1 100  Novus Biologicals  CO \n\nUSA  Detection was performed by incubating with the Dako EnVision + System HRP-labeled\n\npolyclonal anti-rabbit antibody  Agilent Inc  Palo Alto  CA  USA  for 30 min  followed by\n\nDAB chromogen  Agilent Inc  In the tumor ROI  the Ki-67-positive cells were selected based\n\non brownish nuclear staining using the global histogram-derived thresholding method [19] \n\nWe set the threshold to select the hematoxylin-stained nuclei and count the number of whole\n\ntumor cells  Then we reset the color threshold to select the brownish nuclei and count the\n\nnumber of Ki-67-stained tumor cells  The Ki-67 index was calculated by dividing the number\n\nof Ki-67-positive cells by the number of whole tumor cells \n\nStatistical analyses\n\nFor the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay  Hb content and percentage area of CD31-positive\n\ncells in the four different treatment groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with a\n\npost-hoc t-test with least significant difference significance  LSD \n\nFor US and BLI analyses  the tumor volume on US and signal intensity on BLI over time\n\n every 3 days on USI and every 5 days on BLI  using a repeated measures analysis of variance\n\nand post-hoc comparison tests with LSD were used  In addition  we compared the mean values\n\nof the tumor volume on US and signal intensity on BLI at 30 days in the four different treat-\n\nment groups using one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc t-test with LSD \n\nFor histopathologic analysis  we compared the percentage viable tumor area  percentage\n\nmicrovessel area

\n\nResults\nBiodistribution for tumor targeting\n\nAfter injecting Alexa Fluor1 647-labeled TTAC-0001  a focal signal appeared in the right\n\nflank area after 24 h and was detected in both TTAC-2 and TTAC-10 groups  but not in the\n\ncontrol group  These results are suggestive of tumor targeting of TTAC-0001 to the right mam-\n\nmary fat pad of the mouse  The TTAC-10 group demonstrated higher fluorescence accumula-\n\ntion at the tumor implantation site and a longer fluorescence accumulation of up to 6 days\n\nthan TTAC-2 group  Fig 2  indicating a higher and longer level of tumor targeting in the\n\nhigh-dose TTAC-10 group \n\nMode of action of the anti-angiogenic effect\n\nMatrigel plugs from TTAC-0001-treated groups were pale white in appearance  but those from\n\nthe control group were bright red  Fig 3  indicating a reduction in new blood vessel formation\n\nin the TTAC-0001-treated groups  The Hb content in the Matrigel plugs was the highest in the\n\ncontrol group  followed by BVZ-10  TTAC-2  and TTAC-10 groups  A significant difference\n\nwas noted between both TTAC-0001-treated groups  TTAC-2 and TTAC-10 groups  and the\n\nBVZ-10 group  P = 0 004 and P = 0 004  Fig 3  However  there was no significant difference\nbetween the TTAC-2 and TTAC-10 Matrigel plugs  P = 0 971  Fig 3 \n\nThe percentage area of CD31-positive cells showed a similar tendency in that the TTAC-2\n\nand TTAC-10 groups had a significantly reduced area of CD31-positive cells compared with\n\nthe control group and the BVZ-10 group  P 3 0 CO 2-O PMID  10547589 \n\n2  Fontanella

Moroccan context \nthe role of well-known reproductive factors in breast cancer remains poorly documented \nThe aim of this study was to explore the relationship between menstrual and reproductive\nfactors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan women in the Fez region \n\nMethods\nA case–control study was conducted at the Hassan II University Hospital of Fez between\nJanuary 2014 and April 2015  A total of 237 cases of breast cancer and 237 age-matched\ncontrols were included  Information on sociodemographic characteristics  menstrual and\nreproductive history  family history of breast cancer  and lifestyle factors was obtained\nthrough a structured questionnaire  Conditional logistic regression models were used to esti-\nmate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer by menstrual and repro-\nductive factors adjusted for potential confounders \n\nResults\nEarly menarche  OR = 1 60  95% CI  1 08–2 38  and nulliparity  OR = 3 77  95% CI  1 98–\n7 30

breast cancer is multifactorial  and includes reproductive  genetic  lifestyle  and envi-\n\nronmental factors [2–5] \n\nIn North Africa  as in many regions that are either developing or in epidemiological transi-\n\ntion  breast cancer incidence rates have clearly risen [6]  In Morocco  breast cancer remains\n\nthe most common cancer in women  constituting about 35 8% of all new cancer diagnoses in\n\nwomen [7]  According to the most recent report of the cancer registry in Casablanca  the age-\n\nstandardized incidence rate of breast cancer increased from 35 0 to 49 5 per 100 000 women\n\nbetween 2004 and 2012  showing an annual increase of 3 18%  The most widely proposed\n\nexplanations for this increase are changes in reproductive behaviors  smaller number of chil-\n\ndren  shorter duration of breastfeeding  higher age at first pregnancy  and in lifestyle and die-\n\ntary habits  higher obesity rates  among Moroccan women in the past three decades [8–10] \n\nNumerous epidemiological studies performed throughout the world have confirmed the\n\nrole of many reproductive factors  such as age at menarche  age at first pregnancy  age at men-\n\nopause  parity  and breastfeeding  in the etiology of breast cancer [2 11 12] \n\nHowever  evidence suggests that international variation in the burden of breast cancer\n\nreflects differences in the patterns of risk factors [13]  In the Moroccan context  the role of\n\nwell-known reproductive factors in breast cancer remains poorly documented  and it is proba-\n\nble that unidentified exposures specific to Moroccan women may play an important role \n\nThe aim of this case–control study was to explore the relationship between menstrual and\n\nreproductive factors and breast cancer risk in Moroccan women in the Fez region  To the best\n\nof our knowledge  this is one of the first epidemiological studies on risk factors for breast can-\n\ncer in Morocco \n\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\n\nThe Fez Breast Cancer Study is a case–control study  conducted at the Hassan II University\n\nHospital of Fez  ranked as one of the most important medical centers in Morocco  covering\n\nmore than 3 million people in the Fez region \n\nIn this study  a total of 474 women  237 cases and 237 age-matched controls  were recruited\n\nbetween January 2014 and April 2015 \n\nStudy subjects\n\nCases were patients recently diagnosed with histologically confirmed breast cancer  all conse-\n\ncutive cases  admitted during the study period to the Medical Oncology Center at the Univer-\n\nsity Hospital of Fez  which is a referral center for breast cancer in the region \n\nControls were healthy women with no history of cancer  who accompanied patients to the\n\nconsultations department at the University Hospital of Fez  This department provides health\n\nconsultations to patients for various medical and surgical specialties  Women who accompa-\n\nnied patients with any type of cancer were excluded from this study  Control subjects were\n\nReproductive factors and breast cancer in the Fez region  Morocco\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0191333 January 16  2018 2 /

of recruiting some controls aged 60 years or older among the\n\nwomen accompanying patients to the hospital  women randomly selected at the consultations\n\ndepartment were asked whether they could provide the telephone numbers and addresses of\n\nother  older women  who could potentially be recruited  Women meeting the age requirement\n\nwere called by telephone  checked for inclusion criteria  and invited to participate in this\n\nstudy  The socioeconomic characteristics such as income and education level of controls\n\nrecruited with this method are approximately the same as those of other

Ethics Committee of the Hassan II University Hospital of Fez \n\nParticipation in this study was strictly voluntary  and all subjects were informed about the\n\nright to withdraw at any time without giving an explanation  All information collected from\n\nparticipants was kept confidential  The Fez Breast Cancer Study was conducted according to\n\nthe guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki  Written informed consent to participate in the\n\nstudy was obtained from all study participants before the interviews were conducted \n\nData collection and measurements\n\nData were collected through face-to-face interviews by six trained interviewers  The pre-tested\n\nstructured questionnaire included information on sociodemographic characteristics  e g  age \n\neducational level

level of expo-\n\nsure to estrogen and progesterone experienced by these women [12] \n\nIn agreement with results from another case–control study in the region [20]  our study did\n\nnot find a statistically significant association between oral contraceptive use and risk of breast\n\ncancer  However  some previous studies found that oral contraceptive use was associated with\n\nan increased risk of breast cancer [46 47]  Age at starting oral contraceptive use might be deter-\n\nminant in the association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer risk  however  we\n\ndid not have information on that variable  so we were unable to further assess its effect in our\n\nstudy \n\nThe relationship between history of abortions and breast cancer risk is controversial\n\n[48]  In the current study  we found that history of abortions is not significantly associated\n\nwith breast cancer risk  This result is in line with a meta-analysis of 53 epidemiological\n\nstudies  including 83 000 women with breast cancer from 16 countries [49]  However  a\n\nrecent meta-analysis conducted in China reported a positive association between breast can-\n\ncer risk and induced abortion [50]  More details about abortion  number  age at abortion \n\nmay provide important information on the relationship between abortion and breast cancer\n\nrisk \n\nOur study has some limitations  First  due to the retrospective nature of this study  most of\n\nour data were self-reported by women  and could be subject to recall bias  However  women\n\nwere not aware of potential risk factors for breast cancer  and therefore measurement error is\n\nmost likely to be random  non-differential misclassification  Another limitation is the rela-\n\ntively small number of cases and controls  which impaired stratified analysis by menopausal\n\nstatus  and factors with small effect on breast cancer risk may have been missed because of low\n\nstatistical power  In addition  considering that cases were significantly more likely to live in a\n\nrural area and to have a lower monthly household income  compared with controls  the possi-\n\nbility of selection bias cannot be ruled out in this study \n\nThe probable explanation is that controls were recruited from a consultations department\n\nlocated in an urban area  and those accompanying patients to this department are more likely\n\nto reside in an urban area and consequently their socioeconomic status may have been rela-\n\ntively high  The epidemiological transition and the rise of chronic diseases associated with\n\nurban lifestyles that are beginning to be seen among Moroccan women of lower socioeco-\n\nnomic status may be another possible explanation for this difference  It is therefore particularly\n\nimportant to explore the relationship between the socioeconomic level and breast cancer risk\n\nin the Moroccan context \n\nMoreover  in this study some variables were excluded from the analysis  due to the low\n\nnumber of women with certain habits in the region of the study  the frequency of postmeno-\n\npausal hormone use was 1 68% in cases and 0 84% in controls  the frequency of smoking was\n\n4 64% in cases and 0 42% in controls  and the frequency of alcohol consumption was 0 00% in\n\ncases and 0 42% in controls \n\nThis study has several strengths  including an age-matched case–control design  a high par-\n\nticipation rate in cases and controls  and histological confirmation of breast cancer  Moreover \n\nthis is the first epidemiological study to investigate the relationship between reproductive fac-\n\ntors and risk of breast cancer in the Fez region \n\nOur study confirms the role of established reproductive factors for breast cancer in Moroc-\n\ncan women  Studies exploring changes in the pattern of breast cancer risk factors in Morocco\n\n[8 10] suggest that adoption of a Western lifestyle  birth-control policies  and changes in die-\n\ntary habits might have resulted in earlier age at menarche  later age of marriage and first preg-\n\nnancy  and a decline in fertility \n\nReproductive factors and breast cancer in the Fez region  Morocco\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi

screening should focus on these groups as a priority  These\n\nresults should be confirmed in a larger  multicenter study to support the generalization of the\n\nresults to all Moroccan women

are important substrates of the mitogen-activated protein kinase \n MAPK -activated protein kinase family  MSK1 and MSK2 are both nuclear serine/threonine protein kinases  with MSK1 \nbeing suggested to potentially play a role in breast cancer cell proliferation  cell cycle progression  cell migration  invasion \nand tumour growth  The aim of the current study was to assess MSK1 protein expression in breast cancer tumour specimens  \nevaluating its prognostic significance \nMethods A large cohort of 1902 early stage invasive breast cancer patients was used to explore the expression of MSK1  \nProtein expression was examined using standard immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays \nResults Low MSK1 protein expression was associated with younger age  P = 0 004  higher tumour grade  P

expression was significantly associated with \nolder patient age  lower tumour grade  lower NPI values  ER-\npositive and PR-positive tumours  and clinicopathological \nvariables indicative of an improved prognosis  In agreement \nwith this  low MSK1 expression was also found to be associ-\nated with the presence of distant metastasis  recurrence and \ndeath due to breast cancer  as well as the presence of triple-\nnegative and basal-like disease  As MSK1 expression was \nassociated with triple-negative and basal-like disease  the \nprognostic capability of MSK1 expression in these patient \nsub-groups was assessed  Patients with HER2 negative or \n\nnon-basal like diseases had a significantly worse prognosis \nif the tumour expressed low levels of MSK1 \n\nPhosphorylated MSK1

normal tis-\nsue counterparts  Yao et al  2014  Li et al  2015  In the \ncurrent study  total MSK1 expression  rather than phospho-\nrylated MSK1  was assessed  Total MSK1 expression may \nnot be indicative of MSK1 activity within cells  therefore  \nwe cannot infer activity in this study  As mentioned before  \nmany factors are substrates of MSKs and can be phospho-\nrylated by MSK  such as

phosphorylation sites in MSK1 in cells \n McCOY et al  2005  It would be of interest to determine \nMSK1 expression in human tumour tissue by applying \nMSK1 antibodies with different phosphorylation sites and to \nexplore whether MSK1 expression is regulated by a specific \nphosphorylation site \n\nAlthough MSK1 and MSK2 share similarity  they are dif-\nferent complexes and exert differing effects  Interestingly  \ndifferential roles of MSK1 and MSK2 in breast cancer cells \nfollowing UV-radiation have been described  UV radia-\ntion has been shown to induce activation of the NF-κB p65 \nsubunit in MDA-MB-231 cells  which is mainly dependent \non MSK2 rather than MSK1  The depletion of MSK2 was \nfound to reduce cell viability following UV radiation  sug-\ngesting that MSK2-mediated NF-κB activation is involved \nin regulating cell survival in MDA-MB-231 cells  Jacks and \nKoch 2010  Recently  MSK1 and MSK2 were also found \nto be involved in the regulation of phorbol ester-induced \nactivation of trefoil factor 1  TFF1  a breast cancer marker  \nin MCF-7 cells  Khan et al  2013  It would be of interest to \nexamine the potential differential roles of MSK1 and MSK2 \nin breast cancer cell progression  as well as their prognostic \nsignificance \n\nConclusions\n\nThe current study demonstrates that low MSK-1 expression \nis significantly associated with adverse breast cancer-spe-\ncific survival  Low expression seems to play a more impor-\ntant role in certain patient sub-groups  such as those with \nHER2 + or basal-like phenotype disease  This is the first \nreport to describe the potential prognostic significance of \nMSK1 expression in breast cancer patients  although not an \nindependent marker of outcome  we believe such findings \nand significant associations with well-established negative \nprognostic factors  low expression associating with younger \nage  higher tumour grade  higher Nottingham Prognostic \nIndex  negative hormone receptor status  shorter time to \ndistant metastasis  and recurrence  and triple-negative/basal-\nlike status  warrant further examination and validation in \nindependent patient cohorts \n\nAcknowledgements

environmental and genetic variation  Early-onset\nbreast cancer occupies a considerable proportion of breast cancers in Asian populations \nbut the reason for this is unclear  We aimed to examine miRNA expression profiles in differ-\nent age-onset groups and pathological subtypes in Asian breast cancer \n\nMethods\nAt the first stage  10 samples  tumor  n = 6  normal tissue  n = 4  were analyzed with an\nAgilent microRNA 470 probe microarray  Candidate miRNAs with expression levels that\nwere significantly altered in breast cancer samples or selected from a literature review\nwere further validated by quantitative real-time PCR  qPCR  of 145 breast cancer sam-\nples at the second stage of the process  Correlations between clinicopathological\nparameters of breast cancer patients from different age groups and candidate miRNA\nexpression were elucidated \n\nResults\nIn the present study  the tumor subtypes were significantly different in each age group  and\nan onset age below 40 had poor disease-free and overall survival rates  For all breast can-\ncer patients  miR-335 and miR-145 were down-regulated  and miR-21  miR-200a  miR-\n200c  and miR-141 were up-regulated  In very young patients  age   1 5 and the t-test\np value was   35  in more than\n33 3% of samples  and were excluded from the analysis  For the remaining 79 miRNAs  raw Ct\ndata were converted to 39-Ct normalized by global median normalization before further analy-\nsis [14]  The differential expressed miRNAs were selected based on fold change  > 2-fold  t-\ntest  p  50\n\ny/o

t-test   2  p value\nby t-test   2  p value\nby t-test   50 y/o  and the subtype distribution was concordant with other study in Taiwan [2] \n\nHowever  there still no specific miRNAs identified in luminal A subtype from our study\n\n Table 8  Treatment strategies for triple-negative breast cancer were limited due to the lack of\n\neffective therapeutic targets  We discovered that miR-532-5p was up-regulated in the triple\n\nnegative group  miR-532-5p inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the CXCL2\n\noncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [47]  However  it promotes cell growth  migration and\n\ninvasion in gastric cancer cells and melanoma by down-regulating RUNX3 [48  49]  The role\n\nof miR532-5p could be a probable biomarker for prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer \n\nPrognostic analyses in many reports have shown that after adjusting for race  histological\n\ngrade  stage  hormone status and treatment  age was still an independent risk factor related to\n\nprognosis [5  50]  Middle-aged patients have better overall survival than younger and elderly\n\npatients  Generally  this is most likely a result of early disease detection  less aggressive sub-\n\ntypes and better therapy tolerance [51] \n\nIn this study  miR-30c was up-regulated in the middle-aged group  miR-30c targets cyto-\n\nskeleton network genes and regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [52]  It has also\n\nbeen reported to be an independent predictor of advanced breast cancer patients with tamoxi-\n\nfen treatment response and longer progression-free survival [53]  This miRNA alteration may\n\nbe one of the reasons leading to better survival in middle-aged breast cancer patients  Further-\n\nmore  our results identified miR-30c up-regulation in the HER2-negtive group  As the luminal\n\nA group was the major proportion  78 2%  of HER2-negative tumors in our study  This\n\nimplies that miR-30c up-regulation is related to good prognosis in breast cancer patients \n\nConclusion\nIn this study  we revealed differential miRNAs expression between age groups and subtypes of\n\nbreast cancer in Taiwan  Some specific miRNAs limited to an individual group may be\n\nstrongly associated with their clinical presentation  We also found that evolutionarily con-\n\nserved miRNA clusters were up-regulated in very young adults  which may target some genes\n\nto initiate malignancy transformation  Young age was independently as a poor prognostic fac-\n\ntor in long term follow-up  Less miRNA dysregulation was found in the postmenopausal\n\ngroup  In other words  miRNAs may play a particularly important role in tumor initiation in\n\nbreast cancers in very young patients compared with other age groups \n\nCurrently  miRNA is not only a predictor of chemoresistance and chemosensitivity but cir-\n\nculating miRNA could also be used as a biomarker for early cancer detection as well as subtype\n\nprediction  This study could provide information for risk prediction of early-onset breast can-\n\ncer and research of ethnic diversity and therapeutic applications \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig  Unsupervised

lymphedema formation in BC patients  In younger\nwomen  obesity seems to be the major player in lymphedema development and  in older\nwomen  improving muscle strength through AE can prevent lymphedema  In essence  MLD\nis as safe and effective as AE in rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery \n\nIntroduction\nEarly diagnosis and treatment advances in breast cancer  BC  allowed increased survival [1] \n\nso that more women are living with possible side effects of the treatment [2]  Morbidities in\n\nthe upper limb  UL  ipsilateral to surgery are among the main adverse effects of treatment \n\nOne year after surgery  approximately 85% [3] of the women report at least one physical mor-\n\nbidity  such as pain  limited range of motion  ROM  and lymphedema [4]  Therefore  there is\n\nan effort to implement preventive measures and treatments to minimize these considerable\n\nfunctional and psychological disturbances [5–7] \n\nBreast cancer related lymphedema is one of the most common physical complications caus-\n\ning substantial functional and psychological disturbance [6 7  8]  It is a chronic condition that\n\nmay develop any time after surgery [9]  Recently  questions regarding the role of exercise and\n\nthe risk of lymphedema have emerged [10]  The benefits of active exercise  AE  in shoulder\n\nrehabilitation after breast cancer surgery are extensively described in the literature [11–14] \n\nand this approach has become standard practice in referral services [9]  Repercussions of early\n\nexercise on the formation of collateral lymphatic vessels and lymphatic flow to promote the\n\nprevention of lymphedema are not fully known [14]  Studies showed that women who per-\n\nformed exercises of progressive load had a reduced risk of developing lymphedema [10–15] \n\nManual lymphatic drainage  MLD  is also widely used in women with lymphedema [16]  Lym-\n\nphoscintigraphy studies showed that this technique promotes greater absorption of radiophar-\n\nmaceuticals  possibly indicating a reduced risk for lymphedema [17 18]  However  MLD and\n\nAE have not yet been compared long term clinical trials [19 20] \n\nOn the other hand  there is no straightforward methodology to predict lymphedema forma-\n\ntion  precluding the prescription of preventive measures  such as AE or MLD  Lymphoscinti-\n\ngraphy abnormalities have been found in patients with lymphedema  and the technique has\n\nbeen proposed as an early indicator of lymphedema [18  21]  In clinical research  lymphoscin-\n\ntigraphy of the upper limb has been used to investigate the association between the anatomy\n\nand function of the lymphatic system and the risk of developing lymphedema [22–25]  to\n\nexamine the lymphatic functioning of patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema [26–\n\n28]  and to evaluate the effect of physical therapy [29 30] or surgical treatment [31] on the lym-\n\nphatic system \n\nLong-term effects of physiotherapy techniques

manuscript \n\nCompeting interests  The authors have declared\n\nthat no competing interests exist \n\n\n\n\nThe aim of this study was thus to compare the long term  up to 30 months after surgery \n\neffects of MLD and AE concerning 1  wound complications  2  ROM recovery  3  lymphatic\n\nparameters as described by lymphoscintigraphy  and 4  lymphedema formation  To our\n\nknowledge  this is the most comprehensive clinical trial assessing the rehabilitation of the\n\nupper limb in women with BC \n\nMethods\nSubjects\n\nIn this clinical trial  we evaluated women undergoing unilateral mastectomy with lymph node\n\ndissection due to BC  Women were enrolled between November 2009 and August 2013  and fol-\n\nlowed-up through 2016  Patients were treated and followed in the Prof  Dr  Jose´ Aristodemo\n\nPinotti Women’s Hospital–Women’s Integrated Healthcare Center  CAISM/Unicamp  in Bra-\n\nzil  Women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction were excluded  Also were excluded\n\npatients who   a  before surgery had a difference in UL circumference greater than two centime-\n\nters   b  had motor deficit or infection in the UL ipsilateral to surgery   c  had

who\n\nagreed to participate underwent evaluation at the Physical Therapy Outpatient Clinic of\n\nCAISM/Unicamp  One week before surgery  personal and clinical data were collected  UL cir-\n\ncumference and goniometry were obtained and lymphoscintigraphy was scheduled  Women\n\nwere matched for clinical staging  age  ±10 years  and BMI  according to the following catego-\nries  low weight   2\n\nyears  The DBFL  CC and RAL parameters were not associated with lymphedema formation \n\nIn Table 3  we analyse whether the intervention  AE or MLD  was associated with the lympho-\n\ncintigraphy parameters from baseline to up to 30 months after surgery  None of the studied\n\nparameters were shown to be associated with the intervention modality  AE or MLD \n\nTable 4 shows the clinical features and postoperative complications as related to lymph-\n\nedema formation after 30 months of follow-up  None of the studied features or complications\n\nwas individually associated with lymphedema  Fig 3 shows the result from a partitioning recur-\n\nsive model fit to analyse the clinical factors associated with lymphedema  Clinical factors\n\nincluded in the model

bifurcations  Age 39 years was the factor with the greatest\n\nassociation with lymphedema  p = 0 009  In women with age 39 years  BMI >24Kg/m2 was\n\nsignificantly associated with lymphedema  p = 0 017  In women over 39 years old  those who\n\nwere allotted to MLD group were at a significantly higher risk of developing lymphedema than\n\ntheir counterparts allotted to the AE group  p = 0 011 \n\nOn multivariate analysis  no relationship was found between development of lymphedema\n\nand flexion and abduction ROM of the UL ipsilateral to surgery in the postoperative evalua-\n\ntions  Table 5 \n\nDiscussion\nOur study clearly shows that MLD and AE for UL rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery\n\nproduced similar effects on wound complications  ROM  and lymphoscintigraphy parameters\n\nin the short and long run  In addition  our study suggests that AE may be more effective than\n\nMLD for the prevention of lymphedema in women older than 39 years  It is also important to\n\nmention that the DUALN and VVALN lymphoscintigraphy parameters  when measured\n\nbefore surgery  can help discriminate women at higher risk of developing lymphedema after\n\nsurgery  regardless of age  body mass index or whether the patient underwent AE or MLD \n\nLong-term effects of physiotherapy techniques on physical morbidity postoperative breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10

older women are less likely to develop\n\nlymphedema later in the survival trajectory is unclear [45]  Reports show that older women\n\nwho survived breast cancer are more likely to attribute their symptoms to aging or other\n\ncomorbidities  whereas younger women  especially those who are active in work or engaged in\n\nFig 3  Recursive partitioning showing the factors associated with the

[21] \n\nWe also detected an association of lymphedema risk and higher BMI  Although obesity is a\n\nmajor clinical risk factor for lymphedema  the mechanisms that regulate this effect remain\n\nunknown [48 49]  Recent reports have demonstrated that obesity is associated with acquired\n\nlymphatic dysfunction [48 50]  The hypothesis to explain obesity-induced lymphedema are\n\nthat the lymphatics in the extremity are normal but the elevated pressure from the weight of\n\nthe tissue or progressive skin folds also might collapse lymphatic vessels [49]  or yet to\n\nimpaired baseline lymphatic clearance and an increased propensity for inflammation [48] \n\nfibrosis and adipose deposition may destroy lymph vessels and/or nodes [5 48–50] \n\nIn the current study  a considerable number of women from both groups showed radio-\n\npharmaceutical VVALN and DUALN decrease in postoperative lymphoscintigraphy  This\n\nworsening occurred regardless of the rehabilitation technique employed and may be related to\n\nlymphatic system impairment caused by axillary dissection  surgical aggressiveness [6]  altered\n\nscar formation and presence of seroma [51]  as well as the preoperative constitution of lym-\n\nphatic system [28 52]  This later effect may help explain why VVALN and DUALN parameters\n\nbefore surgery were associated with lymphedema formation after surgery  In this same line of\n\nTable 5  Clinical features  postoperative complications and adjuvant treatment as related to the development of lymphedema after 30 months of follow-up \n\nLymphedema

women destined to develop lymphedema the lym-\n\nphatic contractile work rate is already high and if this is raised further by increased resistance\n\nto axillaries drainage following cancer treatment and/or further increase in lymph load  the\n\nlymphatics are gradually tipped into chronic failure  The authors suggest an analogy to high\n\npreload and high after load cardiac failure in systemic hypertension  where the reduced lym-\n\nphatic pump activity then leads to overt clinical edema [52] \n\nIn essence  our study shows that manual lymphatic drainage is as safe and effective as exer-\n\ncise in rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery  Also of note  our data clearly shows that lym-\n\nphatic abnormalities precede lymphedema formation in BC patients  In younger women \n\nobesity seems to be the major player in lymphedema development  and actions devoted to\n\nreduce body weight may be of great benefit to women undergoing surgery for BC  On the\n\nother hand  our study shows that in older women  interventions focused on improving muscle\n\nstrength are pivotal in preventing lymphedema formation \n\nStudies have suggested the use of Kinesiotaping  extracorporeal shock wave therapy and\n\nlow-level laser therapy in the treatment of lymphedema  Among the physiological effects of\n\nthese resources are the improvement of microcirculation  activation of lymph drainage\n\n[53 54 55 56]  increased lymphangiogenesis [54 55 56]  and decreased neutrophils  inflamma-\n\ntion [54 55] and adipocyte count [54]  In this way  further research can be carried out to pro-\n\nvide evidence of preventive effects of these resources in lymphedema formation \n\nStudy limitation\n\nWe believe that our study shows evidence that the MLD and AE effects are equivalent regard-\n\ning postoperative morbidities in patients treated for BC  Our study  however  has some limita-\n\ntions  First  the study design is suboptimal  since this is not a randomized controlled trial  On\n\nthe other hand  careful balancing of baseline characteristics and multivariate analyses were\n\nused to compensate for possible selection biases  Second  we have not included women who\n\nunderwent sentinel lymph node biopsy  which is the current standard of care for many clinical\n\nsituations  We acknowledge that this is a limiting analytical factor  Other exclusion criteria \n\nsuch as previous radiotherapy and breast reconstruction  in our view  bring more benefits than\n\ndetrimental effects to the analysis \n\nConclusion\nMLD is as safe and effective as exercise in rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery  Both tech-\n\nniques have the same effect on ROM  wound  lymphatic parameters as described by lymphos-\n\ncintigraphy and lymphedema incidence up to 30 months after surgery  Impaired absorption\n\nand lymph flow evaluated preoperatively by lymphoscintigraphy are predictors for the devel-\n\nopment of lymphedema in the long term

clinical importance  assessment of Ki67 remains a chal-\nlenge  as current manual scoring methods have high inter- and intra-user variability  A major\nreason for this variability is selection bias  in that different observers will score different\nregions of the same tumor  Here  we developed an automated Ki67 scoring method that\neliminates selection bias  by using whole-slide analysis to identify and score the tumor\nregions with the highest proliferative rates  The Ki67 indices calculated using this method\nwere highly concordant with manual scoring by a pathologist  Pearson’s r = 0 909  and\nbetween users  Pearson’s r = 0 984  We assessed the clinical validity of this method by\nscoring Ki67 from 328 whole-slide sections of resected early-stage  hormone receptor-posi-\ntive  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer  All patients had\nOncotype DX testing performed  Genomic Health  and available Recurrence Scores  High\nKi67 indices correlated significantly with several clinico-pathological correlates  including\nhigher tumor grade  1 versus 3  P 30  33 10 0\n\n*  Age at Dx not available for one patient  ER  estrogen receptor  PgR

method developed  50 cases were selected\n\nat random  and subjected to automated analysis separately by one novice and one expert user \n\nAs expected  scores from both users were concordant and reproducible with minimal variance\n\n Fig 2B  Pearson’s r = 0 984  P<0 001 \n\nClinical validity of whole-slide hot spot analysis\nThere is no consensus about the relative validity of Ki67 scoring of hot spots  as compared to\n\nscoring of the entire slide  The analysis of hot spots allows representation of the most aggres-\n\nsive tumor regions from otherwise heterogeneously-proliferative tumor specimens [20  45 \n\n46]  however  the utility of this approach is normally marred by inter-user bias  We hypothe-\n\nsized that the elimination of bias  as is the case with our assay  would allow the generation of\n\nKi67 indices that were more strongly correlated with common prognostic factors  Correlations\n\nwere assessed between whole-slide or hot-spot Ki67 indices and multiple clinico-pathological\n\nvariables  Table 2  There were interactions between Ki67 indices generated from both\n\napproaches  whole-slide and hot-spot  and all three Oncotype DX risk groups  Ki67 indices\n\nalso correlated positively with the Recurrence Scores  tumor grade and mitotic score  and neg-\n\natively with ER and PgR Allred scores  There were no notable differences in the extent to\n\nwhich either whole-slide or hot-spot indices interacted with the clinico-pathological variables \n\nIt is worth mentioning here that Ki67 scores from both approaches  whole-slide and hot-\n\nspot  were strongly correlated  Pearson r = 0 938  however  the hot-spot indices were signifi-\n\ncantly higher than the whole-slide indices across the entire cohort  S1 Fig  and when patients\n\nwere stratified into Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence groups  S2 Fig \n\nSince Ki67 is the greatest contributor to the Oncotype DX assay’s results  we evaluated the\n\nassociation between hot-spot Ki67 indices and Oncotype DX Recurrence Scores  The correla-\n\ntion between these  while modest  was significant  Fig 3A  Pearson’s r = 0 553  P<0 001 \n\nWhile the distribution of Ki67 indices for low-risk patients overlapped with those for interme-\n\ndiate-risk patients  the median Ki67 indices were significantly higher in the latter  Table 2  In\n\ncontrast  Ki67 indices of high- and low-risk patients assorted into distinct clusters  Fig 3B  A\n\nclear difference in the Ki67 indices between high- and low-risk patients was observed  Pear-\n\nson’s r = 0 684  P<0 001  with 97% patients in the high-risk category having Ki67 indices over\n\n20% \n\nThe use of machine learning to infer Oncotype DX risk groups\nKi67 is the main contributor to the Oncotype DX recurrence score [29  36  37]  and markers of\n\nproliferation similarly contribute to the risk-of-recurrence assessments of other multigene\n\nassays [30]  We asked if an integrated machine learning analysis of clinico-pathological data \n\nincluding the Ki67 scores generated by our automated assay  could provide useful information\n\nabout recurrence risk in these patients  We created and evaluated a Random Forest machine\n\nlearning model  using a subset of 199 patients for whom we had complete data sets  While we\n\nused all available Oncotype DX data for model training  we focused our assessment of model\n\nperformance on high- and low-risk patients  This is because the intermediate risk patients con-\n\nstitute an ambiguous group from both predictive and treatment standpoints [36  41]  The out-\n\nline for model training  evaluation and cross-validation is shown in Fig 4  the variables used\n\nare listed in S2 Table  and the summary results from 1 000 rounds of cross-validation are

models trained without\n\nthese data  however  the differences were modest  particularly for accuracy  1 0%  and negative\n\npredictive value  6 3%  Similar results were obtained when Ki67 indices from whole-slide\n\nanalyses were used in place of the hot-spot data  Table 3  To determine which variables con-\n\ntributed the most to the accuracy of the model  we calculated the increase in mean squared\n\nerror  which indicates the degree to which the model’s accuracy would decrease if a specific\n\nvariable were omitted  In the pRSodx models  PgR  determined by RT-PCR in the Oncotype\n\nDX assay  and Ki67 were the greatest contributors  together accounting for approximately\n\n70% of the model’s accuracy  Fig 5A  In the absence of Oncotype DX data  Ki67 was the high-\n\nest contributor towards model accuracy  with its loss creating a mean squared error increase of\n\n45 3%  Fig 5B \n\nDiscussion\nKi67 is commonly used as a marker for proliferation  and has significant value as a

considerable\n\ninter-user discordance  creating difficulties in identification and validation of cut-points  In\n\nthis report  we present a simple  automated scoring method for Ki67 assessment which\n\naddresses some of the key challenges currently associated with the analysis of this biomarker \n\nFurthermore  this method combines the advantages of an unbiased whole-slide analysis with\n\nthe clinical value of identifying the hot spots of highest tumor proliferation  The method fea-\n\ntures very high concordance against expert manual scoring  and between users  Finally  the\n\nKi67 indices derived from this method correlate as expected with other clinico-pathological\n\nvariables  and allow accurate inference of Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence groups \n\nWhile several other groups have applied automated methods to the quantification of Ki67\n\n[23  48  49]  including some large multi-center studies [50  51]  our approach addresses a num-\n\nber of limitations evident in those studies  Many hormone receptor-positive breast cancers\n\nexhibit differences in proliferative rate across their spatial extents  In such tumors  the hot\n\nspots of higher-than-average proliferative indices are clinically meaningful [52  53]  Conse-\n\nquently  automated analysis of tissue microarrays  or of manually-selected tumor regions \n\nincur the same potential for selection bias as do manual scoring approaches [20  54]  We\n\naddressed this problem by segmenting each slide image into tiles prior to analysis  since the\n\nentire image was subsequently analyzed  the hot spots emerged naturally as the tiles with the\n\nhighest Ki67 scores  Furthermore  as the Ki67 index represents the mean of the top five tiles \n\nwe captured Ki67 data from multiple hot spots across each slide  as well as from non-hot spot\n\nregions  The result was a Ki67 index that accounted for proliferative heterogeneity without\n\nsacrificing either accuracy or robustness of performance  In contrast  for whole-slide Ki67\n\nindex  Ki67 scores from the tiles comprising the entire marked area on the slide were assessed \n\nThe key advantage of computer-assisted analysis of Ki67 is consistency of scoring  particu-\n\nlarly between users [23  25]  The version of the analysis algorithm described here represented\n\nFig 3  Assessment of

any extra optimization  While the automated analysis\n\ndemonstrated high concordance against a pathologist’s manual scoring  the key demonstration\n\nof utility was in the inter-user comparison  With less than 15 minutes of educational-instruc-\n\ntion  a novice user of the software was successfully trained to perform an analysis of 50 slides \n\nobtaining almost perfect concordance with an expert user  The only manual intervention\n\nrequired  and thus the only sources of inter-user variance  were in transferring the patholo-\n\ngist’s annotations to the digital images  and visual quality assessment of the top-scoring tiles \n\nThe automated analysis thus demonstrates a number of features–validity against the gold stan-\n\ndard  reproducibility  and ease of use–that could facilitate its implementation in a clinical\n\nenvironment \n\nTable 3  Summary performance of the Random Forest models predicting Oncotype DX risk groups  Recurrence Scores were predicted using the

we\n\napplied in this study was not immediately apparent  We consequently used multiple methods\n\nto evaluate the validity of our Ki67 data  Previous studies highlighted associations between\n\ntumor proliferation and a variety of clinico-pathological endpoints  such as tumor grade \n\nstage  and ER/PgR expression [55–57]  We observed in this study that Ki67 indices  derived\n\nfrom either whole-slide or hot-spot analysis approaches  correlated significantly with all of\n\nthese  It is thus likely that  at least for the purposes highlighted in this study  whole-slide and\n\nhot-spot Ki67 analyses may be equally useful  so long as they are accurately determined  Ki67\n\nis the greatest contributor to Oncotype DX recurrence score [31]  and a strong correlation\n\nbetween Ki67 index and recurrence score could provide evidence supporting the clinical valid-\n\nity of our approach [37  48  58]  We observed a particularly strong correlation between Ki67\n\nindex and the high and low Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence categories  Finally  we applied a\n\nmultivariate machine learning approach to determine if Ki67 indices could contribute to pre-\n\ndiction of these Oncotype DX categories  Remarkably  a model trained solely on clinico-patho-\n\nlogical data  biomarker expression and Ki67 indices in both hot spot and whole-slide\n\napproaches predicted high- and low-risk of recurrence groups with 97% accuracy  In this con-\n\ntext  Ki67 index was the most significant contributor to the accuracy of the model  Our results\n\nare similar to those published recently by Kim and colleagues [41]  who used an identical\n\nmachine learning approach to predict Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence status from clinico-\n\npathological and biomarker expression data  Given that Oncotype DX prediction methods \n\nincluding the linear regression Magee equations [36  40  59]  utilize potentially unreliable data\n\nfrom manual Ki67 scoring  it is likely that the accuracy of such methods would be significantly\n\nimproved with robust Ki67 data from automated analyses \n\nOur study has a number of shortcomings that need to be addressed in the future  First  this\n\nstudy was conducted in a single academic center  consequently  it is not clear what logistical\n\nproblems may occur in implementing this method in a multi-institutional setup  Secondly  the\n\nmanual scores in this study were generated by a single pathologist so the exact measure of the\n\ninter-observer variability in calculating Ki67 index manually cannot be obtained and com-\n\npared with the automatically generated Ki67 indices  Also  the manual scores were generated\n\nusing a single tissue section from each patient with the largest tumor cross sectional area  It is\n\npossible that the single section selected may not represent the true mitotic nature of the tumor \n\ndue to intra-tumoral heterogeneity  The methodology as presented involves the use of expen-\n\nsive  proprietary software  HALO1  However  the fundamentals should be reproducible on a\n\nsufficiently robust open-source framework  such as CognitionMaster [41  60]  This needs to be\n\ntested and could determine the extent of variability in results amongst different image analysis\n\nsoftware  Furthermore  development and assessment of the machine learning model was only\n\npossible on a subset of patients  199  for whom we had complete data sets  since the modeling\n\nparadigm is not tolerant of missing data  In this  as in similar studies [36  40  59]  there were\n\nfew patients in the high risk-of-recurrence group  further testing of the model needs to be car-\n\nried out in a larger patient population  with a more equitable distribution of patients in all\n\nthree risk categories  The small cohort size also precluded our ability to evaluate a locked-\n\ndown Random Forest model on a separate  independent group of patients  Such an approach\n\nwould constitute a more thorough validation of the concepts introduced in the current proof-\n\nof-principle work \n\nIn the present study  we have addressed the issue of Ki67 scoring which to date remains a\n\nmajor hurdle in clinical use of Ki67 as a biomarker  We present an automated  robust and\n\nreproducible method for quantification of Ki67 from whole-slide sections of breast cancer \n\nThe consistency and ease-of-use of this Ki67 analysis approach may facilitate the standardized\n\nKi67 assay for breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188983 January 5  2018 13 /

risk-of-recurrence\n\nstatus  when implemented in a multivariate machine learning model  The utility of predictive\n\nmodeling  bolstered by the availability of accurate Ki67 data  may reduce the need for expen-\n\nsive multigene assays to assess risk of recurrence \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig  Comparison of Ki67 indices from whole-slide and hot-spot analyses \n\n DOCX \n\nS2 Fig  Comparison

 next-\n\ngeneration sequencing\n\n1 | INTRODUCTION\n\nCancer is the most common genetic disease that results from the\n\naccumulation of genetic alterations  These genetic alterations are\n\ndivided into 2 major categories  germline and somatic  Germline\n\nalterations are found in the germ cell  hence  this type of alteration\n\ncan be inherited from parents to offspring  somatic mutations are\n\ncellular alterations that are randomly acquired throughout the\n\nlifetime after exposure to various carcinogens or aging that damage\n\nthe DNA  Both germline and somatic alterations play pivotal roles in\n\npredisposing individuals to cancer and to the initiation as well as to\n\nprogression of cancer  Therefore  genetic alterations could serve as\n\neffective biomarkers for early detection  monitoring and prognosis of\n\ncancer \n\nCancer precision medicine aims to provide the right dose of the\n\nright drug for the right patient at the right time  based on the\n\ngenetic profiles of cancer and the individual 1 To realize this vision \n\nrapid advancement of bioinformatics and biotechnology that con-\n\ntribute to the great expansion of the “omics era” makes it possible\n\nto magnify screening from a single gene to the whole genome by\n\nusing genome-wide genotyping for genome-wide association studies\n\n GWAS  or next-generation sequencing  NGS  for cancer genome\n\nprofiling studies  Equally  this also starts the requirement for a super-\n\ncomputer/high-performance cluster computing system and use of\n\ncloud space to accommodate the analyses and to store the rapidly\n\naccumulating big genomic data  Notably  just like finding a needle in\n\na haystack  the greatest challenge of handling big genomic data is to\n\ncurate and identify clinically

researchers to access as\n\nwell as to assist with the curation of large-scale genomic data \n\nThe current review summarizes the accumulation and achieve-\n\nment of big genomic data and how these could be part of the vision\n\nof cancer precision medicine by using breast cancer as a disease\n\nmodel  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women\n\nworldwide  It is well known that breast cancer is a complex polygenic\n\ndisease and besides the reported risk factors that include age  age at\n\nmenarche  ethnicity  reproductive and menstrual history  oral contra-\n\nceptive use  hormone therapy  radiation exposure  alcohol intake  diet-\n\nary folate intake  physical activity and benign breast diseases  genetic\n\nfactors play an important role in disease etiology and pathogenesis 6\n\n2 | GERMLINE VARIATION  TRANSITION\nFROM THE CANDIDATE GENE APPROACH\nTO GWAS AND NGS\n\nIdentification of germline mutations began 3 decades ago by examin-\n\ning rare but highly penetrant mutations that inherit with cancer in\n\nlarge families that showed Mendelian modes of inheritance  These\n\nhereditary cancers account for approximately 5%-10% of all cancer 7\n\nThe majority of these mutations are inherited in an autosomal domi-\n\nnant manner  Genetic linkage analysis has successfully localized\n\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 as highly penetrant cancer susceptibility genes\n\nfor hereditary breast-ovarian cancers 8 9 Individuals who possess\n\nmutations in these highly penetrant genes have a significantly higher\n\nrisk of developing cancer than those in the general population  Nev-\n\nertheless  mutations in high-penetrance genes explained only a frac-\n\ntion of the heritability of human cancers 10 Even though the\n\ncandidate gene approach  which focuses on the DNA damage\n\nresponse pathway and cancer-related genes  the mutations in\n\nCHEK2  PALB2  PTEN and ATM11-14 confer moderate effects on\n\nbreast cancer  indicating the necessity to uncover more genetic alter-\n\nations that are associated with this complex cancer \n\n2 1 | CommonVariants-CommonDisease  Emergence\nof Gwas and NGS\n\nApproximately 99 9% of the DNA sequence is identical in the 3 2\n\nbillion base pairs of the human genome across different individuals \n\nthe remaining 0 1% consists of mostly common variants showing sig-\n\nnificant inter-individual variability  These common variants are mostly\n\nrepresented by a single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP  that occurs\n\nin every 300-1000 nucleotides  and the human genome comprises\n\napproximately 10 million SNP  The common disease-common vari-\n\nants hypothesis presumed inheritance by the cumulative number of\n\nalleles that conferred a modest increase in disease risk  relative risk\n\nranged from 1 1 to 1 5  Besides explaining inter-individual external\n\nphenotypic features such as eye color  height  size of the head and\n\nmany others  these common variants could be used as predictive\n\nmarkers for disease susceptibility  drug response and drug-induced\n\ntoxicity \n\nTo better understand genetic inheritance  linkage disequilibrium\n\n LD  which is nonrandom association of alleles at nearby loci  was\n\nintensely studied  In the year 2001  the International HapMap Pro-\n\nject was started to characterize the LD patterns of individuals from\n\n4 major continents that included Caucasians  Africans  Chinese and\n\nJapanese 15 The database that was established from the HapMap\n\nproject enabled the selection of representative SNP  tagSNP  for LD\n\nblocks  which lead to the possibility of carrying out GWAS by evalu-\n\nating a reduced number of tagSNP that represented the whole gen-\n\nome  To uncover all SNP for the whole genome  the untyped SNP\n\ncould be inferred by referring typed SNP of GWAS to the whole\n\ngenome reference sequence from the 1000 genomes reference data-\n\nbase by using genotype imputation analysis 16 Figure 1 summarizes\n\nthe workflow of carrying out GWAS that includes phenotype selec-\n\ntion  genome-wide genotyping  data quality control and visualization\n\nas well as subsequent post-GWAS analyses  GWAS arise as the ini-\n\ntial stage of accumulating big data when study groups have started\n\nto increase the sample size up to hundreds of thousands through\n\ncollaborative studies \n\nAs the effect size of a variant varies among populations \n\nGWAS are mostly carried out in a population-specific way  with\n\nthe majority of GWAS reported from European descendants fol-\n\nlowed by East Asians  Africans and Latin Americans  Nevertheless \n\na great number of meta-analyses were carried out through interna-\n\ntional consortium networks with the purpose of identifying shared\n\ngenetic susceptibilities among different populations for various\n\ncomplex diseases  For breast cancer  the Breast Cancer Association\n\nConsortium  BCAC  and Asia Breast Cancer Consortium were\n\nstarted to assess the associations of common genetic variations\n\nwith breast cancer \n\nBreast cancer was the very first GWAS that was published\n\namong other cancer GWAS  A total of 28 studies reported and iden-\n\ntified 70 loci for transethnic populations  70 for Europeans  8 for\n\nEast Asians  3 for Africans  2 for Latinos and 1 for Ashkenazi Jews\n\nthat were reported to be associated with susceptibility for breast\n\ncancer  Table S1  with references  summarizes the genetic loci that\n\nare associated with breast cancer from different populations and\n\nmeta-analyses with P-value ≤ 5 0 9 10 8  Among the reported loci \n\n2 most consistently associated with breast cancer in various popula-\n\ntions are fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  FGFR2  on chromo-\n\nsome 10q26  OR = 1 35  95% CI = 1 31-1 40 17 and TOX high\n\nmobility group box family member 3  TOX3 -cancer susceptibility 16\n\n CASC16  on chromosome 16q12  OR = 1 31  95% CI = 1 22-1 41 18\n\nAssociation of FGFR2 contributes up to 16% of all breast cancers\n\nindicating a significant disease burden  FGFR2 is overexpressed in\n\n5%-10% of breast tumors 19 System biology approach suggests a link\n\nbetween FGFR2 germline variants could reduce a cell’s ability to\n\nrespond to estrogen activation 20 In contrast  TOX3 expression is\n\nhighly up-regulated in luminal breast cancer compared to normal\n\nbreast tissues or basal-like tumors 21 SNP rs4784227 alters the\n\nexpression of TOX3 by disrupting the enhancer function through\n\n498 | LOW ET AL \n\n\n\nforkhead box A1  FOXA1  affinity modulation in which FOXA1 is\n\ncentral to the establishment of transcriptional programs responding\n\nto estrogen stimulation in estrogen receptor 1  ESR1 -positive breast\n\ncancer cells 22 Notably  various GWAS also identified the association\n\nof variants on ESR1 that encodes estrogen receptor alpha  ER-alpha \n\nwith breast cancer risk 23 ER-alpha is known to act as a transcrip-\n\ntional regulator by interacting with estrogen  Taken together  the\n\nfindings from different GWAS have successfully identified novel\n\ngene involvement in various pathways that are related to breast can-\n\ncer carcinogenesis \n\nAmong the novel loci identified by breast cancer GWAS  2 loci \n\n8q24 21 and 5p15 33  are of particular interest as they showed\n\npleiotropic effects with multiple cancer susceptibility 24 25 In locus\n\n8q24 21  14 independent significant associations were identified\n\nfrom cancer GWAS of breast  prostate  colon  ovarian  bladder  pan-\n\ncreatic cancers and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 24 All of these vari-\n\nants are clustered within a large gene desert with 2 nearest genes \n\nfamily with sequence similarity 84 member B  FAM48B  and MYC\n\nproto-oncogene  MYC  Several studies hypothesize that the risk\n\nregions possess a regulatory element to the well-known\n\nF IGURE 1 Summary workflow of genome-wide association studies  GWAS  GWAS starts from the determination of phenotypes  Genomic\nDNA extracted from samples was genotyped with chips that contained up to hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNP \nQuality control  QC  was carried out on samples and SNP before association studies  Sample quality control includes   1  sample quality to\nexclude poorly genotyped samples   2  identity-by-state analysis to exclude close relatedness samples  and  3  principal component analysis to\nevaluate population stratification of the sample sets to obtain a homogeneous sample set before carrying out the association study  SNP QC\nwere set to exclude SNP if   1  they were of low genotype quality   2  if SNP deviated from normal distribution by evaluating the Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium in control samples  and  3  if they contained non-polymorphic SNP  minor allele frequency = 0  To evaluate the\nassociation distribution  quantile-quantile plots  Q-Q plot  of observed P-value vs expected P-value and genomic inflation factor  k value  were\nevaluated to eliminate the possibility of population substructure  Manhattan plots of P-value   log10  vs chromosome loci were used to depict\nan overview of the GWAS  with each dot representing a SNP and each color representing a chromosome  Post-GWAS included   A  a meta-\nanalysis that combined multiple studies to identify significantly associated SNP  and  B  functional analysis  Two of the most common\nfunctional analyses of the identified variants are   i  electrophoretic mobility shift assay  EMSA  to check the existence of proteins  mainly\ntranscription factors  binding to SNP-contained DNA fragments  and  ii  luciferase reporter assay  comparison of relative luciferase activity  to\nassess the associated SNP that could affect differential gene expression  as shown in the figure   C  Other analyses  including gene-based\nanalysis  pathway analysis  polygenic risk estimation  SNP-SNP interaction  SNP-environment interaction etc  could be carried out after GWAS\n\nLOW ET AL  | 499\n\n\n\nproto-oncogene  MYC  Variants on this region showed differential\n\nbinding to transcription factor 7-like 2  TCF7L2  that physically inter-\n\nacts with MYC and Wnt-regulated transcription factor  Transcription\n\nfactor 4  TCF4  indicates the possibility of the enhancement of the\n\nWnt signaling pathway that subsequently regulates MYC 24 Never-\n\ntheless  the direct relationship between susceptibility SNP and MYC\n\nexpression has not been elucidated  The second locus is telomerase\n\nreverse transcriptase  TERT -cleft lip and palate transmembrane pro-\n\ntein 1-like protein  CLPTM1L  on 5p15 33 that is found to be signifi-\n\ncantly associated with breast  lung  melanoma  prostate  pancreatic \n\novarian  testicular cancers  chronic lymphocytic leukemia  glioma and\n\nglioblastoma 25 TERT functions to maintain telomere length and\n\nintegrity as well as promoting epithelial cell proliferation 26 Telom-\n\nerase is found to counteract the process of telomere shortening that\n\nis known to increase cancer risk and death 27 Hence  associated vari-\n\nants that affect the expression of TERT are of significance in pre-\n\nventing or enhancing tumorigenesis  Thus far  there is no concrete\n\nevidence that suggests the role of CLPTM1L in predisposing individu-\n\nals to various types of cancer  Pleiotropic effects in multiple cancers\n\nwould not be able to be assessed without the accumulation of vari-\n\nous data from several GWAS that enhance the contributions of big\n\ngenome data \n\nEven though imputation analysis using the GWAS dataset could\n\nuncover most of the common variants for the whole genome with\n\nhigh accuracy  it still stands as a challenge to impute relatively rare\n\nvariants  To gain information for all types of variants  NGS  also ter-\n\nmed as massive parallel sequencing  has progressed rapidly in the\n\nlast decade to allow simultaneous sequencing of up to millions of\n\nDNA fragments  NGS could generate data based on gene-panels\n\nthat sequence only the number of genes of interest  whole exome\n\nsequencing  WES  that sequence only the exons  and whole genome\n\nsequencing  WGS  that cover the entire genome  The involvement\n\nof NGS in breast cancer is mostly focused on hereditary breast and\n\novarian cancer  HBOC  that uses cancer gene-panels because of its\n\ncost-efficiency and relatively straightforward bioinformatics pipeline \n\nTable 1 summarizes the results from various gene-panels screened\n\nby NGS  All studies consistently found BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer a\n\nmoderate to high risk  whereas PALB2 and CHEK2 confer an incon-\n\nsistently low to moderate risk for HBOC  Rare mutations are also\n\nfound in TP53  ATM  RAD51C  MSH2  MSH6  PMS2  MRE11A \n\nRAD50  NBS1  CDH1  BARD1  NBN  BRIP1  MUTYH  MLH1 and\n\nCDKN2A 28-32\n\nNotably  Aloraifi et al33 established a gene panel that consisted\n\nof 312 genes  which gathered the genes from hereditary  GWAS \n\nsomatic  methylated and gene candidates reported from other stud-\n\nies  and screened 104 subjects that were known to be BRCA1/2\n\nnegative  As a result  the most frequently mutated genes in heredi-\n\ntary breast cancer are ATM  RAD50  CHEK2  TP53  PALB2 and\n\nMRE11A  and among GWAS genes are CDKN2B-AS1  AP3K1  CASP8 \n\nRAD51B  FGF10  NOTCH2  CCDC170  CYP1B1  LEPR  MYHFR and\n\nNQO1  Taken together  a gene-panel that could screen for high pen-\n\netrative mutations and common genetic alterations on a larger sam-\n\nple size are anticipated to identify individuals who are at risk for\n\nbreast cancer \n\nAlthough individual common variants confer only moderate\n\nincreased risk  the cumulative effects of these variants could be eval-\n\nuated through a polygenic genetic risk score  In breast cancer  with\n\nthe variants that are identified to date  women in the highest 1% of\n\nthe distribution have a 3 5-fold greater risk of breast cancer com-\n\npared to the population average  Such a risk prediction model could\n\nbe informative as early detection and subsequent preventive mea-\n\nsures could be carried out 34\n\n2 2 | Pharmacogenomics Studies Identify Germline\nVariations for the Prediction of Drug Response and\nDrug-Induced Adverse Events\n\nPharmacogenomics is the study of how genetic variants in genes\n\nencoding drug metabolism and drug transporters that affect drug\n\navailability at the target site  drug pharmacokinetics  as well as\n\ndrug target proteins  such as receptors  enzymes  and intracellular\n\nsignaling proteins  affect a patient’s sensitivity to a drug  drug\n\npharmacodynamics  Hence  pharmacogenomics studies play an\n\nimportant role in cancer precision medicine  which provides the\n\nright medication to a patient with a good response and a low inci-\n\ndence of adverse drug reaction  In recent years  the US Food and\n\nDrug Administration has started to revise drug labels based on var-\n\nious pharmacogenomics studies  for example  information that\n\nincludes the recommendation to carry out TPMT and UGT1A1\n\ngenotyping before the use of 6-mercaptopurine and camptothecin \n\nrespectively  to predict the occurrence of severe adverse events\n\nbefore treatment 35 36\n\nSimilar to the identification of genetic variants associated with\n\ncancer susceptibility  a pharmacogenomics study for breast cancer\n\nTABLE 1 Various gene panels that are used for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n\nStudy No  patients No  genes >5% 1%-5%  10% incidence across all\n\nbreast cancer 56 Currently  the classification of breast tumor is based\n\nmainly on the expression of estrogen receptor  ER  progesterone\n\nreceptor  PgR  and the overexpression or amplification of oncogenic\n\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER2  The different\n\nmolecular subtypes are \n\n1  ER-positive group is divided into\n\na  luminal A  PgR high  HER2 negative\n\nb  luminal B  PgR low  HER2 negative\n\n2  HER2 type  HER2 positive  particularly aggressive \n\n3  Basal like  often referred to as triple negative breast cancer\n\n TNBC  ER negative  PgR negative  HER2 negative \n\nEven though the classification is based mainly on the expression\n\nof hormonal receptors and HER2 amplification  these molecular sub-\n\ntypes of breast cancer showed different gene mutation patterns that\n\ncould further characterize the different types of breast cancer 56\n\nApproximately 60% of breast cancers are luminal subtype  lumi-\n\nnal A and B  and could be treated with endocrine therapy according\n\nto the St Gallen 2015 recommendations 58 The majority of luminal A\n\nshow good prognosis and require no chemotherapy except those\n\nwith high risk of relapse  Luminal B/HER2 negative tumors require\n\nboth endocrine therapy and chemotherapy  Aromatase inhibitor that\n\nsuppresses estrogen production is 1 of the recommended endocrine\n\ntherapies for metastatic breast cancer patients with ER positivity 59\n\nNonetheless  more than one-third of patients do not benefit from\n\nendocrine therapy owing to intrinsic resistance 60 Even if therapy is\n\nshown to be effective initially  prolonged exposure causes resistance\n\ntowards the therapy  One of the proposed mechanisms that causes\n\nresistance are mutations on the ESR1 gene that render the estrogen\n\nreceptor from constitutive activation 61 62 Hence  monitoring ESR1\n\nmutations could help to assess the resistance of endocrine therapy \n\nFrom the perspective of cancer genomics  luminal A subtypes are\n\nshown to have the most mutated genes  with the most frequent in\n\nPIK3CA  followed by MAP3K1  GATA3  TP53  CDH1 and MAP2K4 \n\nNotably  luminal A tumors harbored inactivating mutations in\n\nMAP3K1 and MAP2K4  which represent 2 contiguous steps in the\n\np38-JNK1 stress kinase pathway 56 Luminal B subtypes showed a\n\ndiversity of mutated genes that include TP53 and PIK3CA being the\n\nmost frequent  Significantly  the TP53 pathway remains largely intact\n\nin luminal A cancers but is often inactivated in more aggressive lumi-\n\nnal B cancers 56 The high frequency of PIK3CA mutations in this\n\nluminal subgroup indicates that inhibitors of this kinase and its\n\nrelated signaling pathway may act as potential druggable targets 56\n\nApproximately 25% of breast cancer patients are HER2 positive\n\nwhich is associated with decreased overall survival and increased risk\n\nof metastasis 63 HER2 protein  human epidermal growth factor\n\nreceptor 2  regulates cell growth  proliferation and differentiation \n\nThe establishment of trastuzumab  a humanized monoclonal antibody\n\nagainst HER2-extracellular domain  and lapatinib  an intracellular tyr-\n\nosine kinase inhibitor that blocks both HER2 and EGFR activation \n\n502 | LOW ET AL \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrepresent a prominent therapeutic advance for HER-2 breast cancer\n\npatients 64 65 Findings from a cancer genomics study suggested\n\nEGFR  FGFR  CDK4 and cyclin D1 as possible druggable targets 56\n\nAmong the subtypes of breast cancer  TNBC is the most hetero-\n\ngeneous subtype and  hence  treatment of this subtype is extremely\n\nineffective and challenging  Owing to this subgroup’s lack of hor-\n\nmonal receptor expression and HER2 amplification as drug target \n\nchemotherapy remains the first-line standard treatment  hence  iden-\n\ntification of new drug targets for this group is essential  In the con-\n\ntext of cancer genomics  unlike luminal and HER2 subgroups  basal-\n\nlike breast cancer showed a high frequency of TP53 mutations  80% \n\nand these mutations caused the loss of TP53 function in almost all\n\nbasal-like breast cancer 56 In addition  basal-like breast cancer\n\nshowed similar genetic characteristics with serous ovarian cancers\n\nthat included TP53  RB1 and BRCA1 loss  with MYC amplification \n\nwhich strongly suggests that common therapeutic approaches  such\n\nas platinum analogues and taxanes could be considered 56 Besides \n\napproximately 20% of basal-like breast cancer was shown to carry\n\nBRCA1/2 mutations  which suggests these patients might benefit\n\nfrom poly ADP ribose polymerase  PARP  inhibitors and/or platinum\n\ncompounds 66 67 Several clinical trials were conducted to evaluate\n\nthe efficacy and response rate of different PARP inhibitors in meta-\n\nstatic breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutations that included basal-like\n\nbreast cancer  In the proof-of-concept trial  the response rate of\n\nTNBC carrying BRCA1/2 mutations was 54% treated with 400 mg\n\nolaparib  a PARP inhibitor  and 25% treated with 100 mg olaparib 68\n\nA phase III study that evaluated the additional iniparib  a PARP inhi-\n\nbitor  with gemcitabine and carboplatin  reported that even though\n\nthere was no statistically significant difference between the combi-\n\nnation of regimen vs gemcitabine and carboplatin as first-line treat-\n\nment  exploratory analysis indicated that patients in the second/third\n\nline showed improved overall survival 69 Notably  a randomized \n\nopen-label phase III trial reported that HER2-negative metastatic\n\nbreast cancer patients with germline BRCA mutation who received\n\nolaparib showed significantly longer progression-free survival  7 0 vs\n\n4 2 months  and a 42% lower risk of disease progression or death\n\ncompared with standard therapy 70\n\n4 | GENOME-BASED MEDICINE THAT\nLEADS TO CANCER PRECISION MEDICINE\n\nUndeniably  the advancement of big genomic data that evolves from\n\nsingle gene to whole-exome  whole-genome and whole-transcriptome\n\nsequencing has offered an unbiased approach for discovery and pro-\n\nvided a great amount of useful information to enhance the progression\n\nof cancer precision medicine  Nevertheless  considering its practical\n\nuse in clinical settings  many academic cancer centers and commercial\n\ntesting laboratories have focused on a fraction of the frequently\n\nmutated genes that provide better cost-effectiveness  lower burden of\n\ndata analysis and rapid turnaround time for making clinical decisions \n\nGene panel-based targeted sequencing that is used in clinical can-\n\ncer genomic profiling is designed to sequence genomic “hot spot”\n\nregions that are frequently mutated in human cancer genes or drug-\n\ngable targets by using DNA from the formalin-fixed paraffin-\n\nembedded  FFPE  tumor or frozen tissue samples  Clinical cancer\n\ngenomic profiling has facilitated the establishment of a “basket” trial\n\nin which enrollment of patients is based on particular mutations\n\nregardless of tumor histology  Frampton et al71 reported a clinical\n\ncancer genomic profiling test that included 287 cancer-related genes\n\nand  among 2221 clinical cases with various cancers  showed action-\n\nable alterations in 76% of tumors  In a large-scale study of 2000\n\npatients with advanced cancer  789  39%  harbored at least 1 muta-\n\ntion in potentially actionable genes  of the 230 patients with PIK3CA/\n\nAKT1/PTEN/BRAF mutations  116  50%  received a genotype-\n\nmatched drug  40  17%  were treated in a genotype-selected trial\n\nrequiring a mutation for eligibility and 40  17%  received a genotype-\n\nrelevant drug off trial 72 Notably  a phase I program that was con-\n\nducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nshowed that patients who received therapy that matched with the\n\nalteration  n = 143  showed a higher objective response rate  12% vs\n\n5%  P <  0001  longer PFS  median  3 9 vs 2 2 months  P =  001 \n\nand longer overall survival  median  11 4 vs 8 6 months  P =  04 \n\ncompared with treatment without matching  n = 236 73 Recently \n\ngenomic alterations in druggable targets  such as EGFR  BRAF  RET \n\nALK  ROS1  CDK4/6  MET  FGFR  were included in trials to match\n\npatients to therapies 74-81 Taken together  comprehensive genomic\n\nprofiling by clinical sequencing could categorize cancer patients based\n\non genetic alterations and therapy could be provided according to\n\nthe genetic alteration  thus implementing cancer precision medicine \n\nParticularly  clinical cancer genomic profiling tests are also extremely\n\nuseful for cancer patients with unknown primary origin  in which the\n\ngenomic profile could provide clues for therapy selection according\n\nto the genetic alteration 82 Nonetheless  there are several challenges\n\nwith this approach that include insufficient amount of DNA obtained\n\nfrom the FFPE tumor for genomic profiling  treating patients with\n\nmutations of unknown significance  driver vs passenger mutations \n\nlimited clinical trials in the institutions  availability of off-label\n\napproved drugs as well as social acceptability of this approach 83\n\nOwing to the invasive method of obtaining biopsy samples from\n\nprimary or metastatic lesions  there is growing interest in the field of\n\nblood-based biomarkers that includes circulating tumor cells  CTC \n\nexosomes and circulating tumor DNA  ctDNA  which  together  is\n\ntermed liquid biopsy  CTC that are released from the primary tumor\n\nand survive in the bloodstream have the potential to seed at sec-\n\nondary sites to form metastases 84 Importantly  CTC could be used\n\nto generate CTC-derived explants  CDX  that show broad similarity\n\nwith the primary tumor  hence  the response of CDX to therapeutic\n\nagents mirrors the patient’s response to the same treatment 85 The\n\nmajor demerit of CTC is that there are only low-input amounts of\n\nCTC from the bloodstream that could be isolated using limited cap-\n\nture techniques 86 Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released\n\nfrom diverse cell types that transfer functional molecules such as\n\nDNA  miRNA  proteins and lipid to the recipient cells 87 88 Lately \n\nmuch research has focused on specific exosomal miRNA that reflect\n\npathological changes in cancer and suggests that exosomes are\n\nLOW ET AL  | 503\n\n\n\npromising biomarkers 89 90 Nevertheless  the isolation and purifica-\n\ntion of exosomes presently remains a challenge 86 ctDNA are short\n\nDNA fragments that originate from apoptosis and necrosis of normal\n\nand tumor cells 91 ctDNA can be detected in the cell-free fraction of\n\nthe blood and provide a snapshot of the genetic profiles of primary\n\nand metastatic tumor site s 92 93 Mutation status in ctDNA is highly\n\nconcordant with the corresponding tumor tissue and the level of\n\nctDNA increase corresponds to the stage of cancer 94 In addition  it\n\nis known that ctDNA has superior sensitivity compared to conven-\n\ntional biomarkers  such as CA-153  and has a greater dynamic range\n\nthat correlates with changes in tumor burden 95 Because half-time of\n\nctDNA is quite short  about 2 hours  they could reflect the current\n\nstatus of both primary tumors and secondary deposits accurately\n\nand sensitively  Applications of ctDNA could be used throughout the\n\ncourse of cancer management that includes   i  early cancer detec-\n\ntion   ii  molecular profiling  prognostication   iii  detection of resid-\n\nual disease   iv  monitoring therapeutic responses  and  v  monitoring\n\nclonal evolution of the tumor 96 In metastatic breast cancer  ESR1\n\nmutations in ctDNA were used to monitor the resistance of aro-\n\nmatase inhibitor treatment in which patients with ESR1 mutations\n\ndetected in the plasma had a markedly shorter progression-free sur-\n\nvival when treated with aromatase inhibitors 97\n\n5 | CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE\n\nCross-talk genetic screening by incorporating germline alterations to\n\nstratify individuals who are predisposed to a higher risk of cancer\n\nand somatic mutations to profile tumor characteristic for precise\n\ntherapy selection can importantly aid patient care  In addition to\n\ngenomics  the advancement of other “ omics” that includes tran-\nscriptomics  epigenomics  proteomics  and metabolomics have further\n\nincreased the complexity of datasets that require sophisticated ana-\n\nlytical tools  Hence  there is much anticipation about the involve-\n\nment of deep machine learning and artificial intelligence to examine\n\nthe integrative clinical and -omics datasets in order to inform  edu-\n\ncate and help cancer treatment and research \n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nAuthors declare no conflicts of interest for

age group\nexpress oestrogen receptor  ER  which makes endocrine therapy  primary or adjuvant  fea-\nsible  given the huge size of the elderly population  there remains a significant number of\npatients  in absolute term  whose tumours do not express ER and their management is\nchallenging \n\nMethods\nOf a consecutive series of 1 758 older   70 years  women with early operable primary\nbreast cancer managed in a dedicated service from 1973–2010  252 14 3%  had ER-nega-\ntive  histochemical  H  score 50  tumours  Their clinical outcome was retrospectively\nreviewed and

overall survival rates were 70% and 50% respectively  Biological analy-\nsis based on good quality needle core biopsy specimensfrom181 patients showed that\n26 8%  N = 49  16 9%  N = 31  and 70 7%  N = 70 expressed positivity for PgR  HER2 and\nKi67 respectively  No correlation between these biomarkers and breast cancer specific sur-\nvival was demonstrated \n\nConclusion\nOestrogen receptor negative early operable primary breast cancer in older women is associ-\nated with poor prognostic features in terms of biology and clinical outcome  Surgery appears\nto produce the best outcome as a primary treatment  however for those where neither sur-\ngery nor chemotherapy is appropriate  primary radiotherapy can be beneficial \n\nIntroduction\nThe risk of developing breast cancer rises with advancing age and one-third of cases occur in\n\nwomen over 70 years of age[1]  The highest life time probability of breast cancer development\n\nwas observed in women 70 years of age  6 73%  as compared to their younger counterparts\n\nwhere the probability reported was 1 44%  2 39% and 3 40% respectively in the age groups of\n\n 50% reduction  stable disease  SD  as\n\n 25% increase in the bi-\n\ndimensional product of the tumour  Appearance of a new tumour  including metastases  was\n\nalso categorised as PD  Clinical benefit  CB  was defined by CR/PR/SD for a minimum dura-\n\ntion of 6 months[12] \n\nBiological analysis of needle core biopsies\nOut of 252 patients with ER-negative tumours  181 sets of good quality needle core biopsy\n\nspecimens were available for biological analysis  Immunohistochemical  IHC  staining was\n\nperformed specifically for this study  for PgR  HER2 and Ki67 by using StreptAvidin Biotin\n\nComplex  ABC  sequenza method  as previously described[13]  The description and the cut-\n\noff points to define positivity of the markers are given in Table 1 \n\nStatistical methods\nStatistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences  SPSS  version\n\n17  Chicago  Illinois  A p-value of 70 years available for\n\nmeta-analysis was limited[15] \n\nIn this series the majority of patients were treated by surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy\n\nas appropriate but no adjuvant chemotherapy  Non-operative therapy  as reported by other\n\nstudies  is usually prescribed due to patients’ choice  ill health or in some cases extreme of age\n\nwhich make surgery an inappropriate option[5  16]  However to date very limited data are\n\navailable reporting on the role of non-operative therapy in this group of patients  In contrast\n\nto the outcome of patients with ER-positive tumours as reported by our group previously\n\n from the large cohort of patients managed in the same dedicated service  where the majority\n\ndied of non breast cancer causes[8]  the majority of those with ER-negative tumours studied\n\nhere died of breast cancer  The annual rates of local and regional recurrences were nearly dou-\n\nble when compared with that seen in ER positive tumours and also the survival outcome was\n\nrelatively poor  Table 5 \n\nWhile this could indicate the aggressive tumour biology of ER-negative tumours  on the\n\nother hand  it may suggest sub-optimal treatment  Not every patient in the series was able to\n\nhave surgery which was shown to be associated with the best outcome  Endocrine therapy does\n\nnot play any role in ER-negative tumours  High level evidence is scarce in supporting the use\n\nof cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab in the elderly population \n\nIn contrast to what was seen by our group in the ER-positive disease  the higher rates of\n\nKi67 expression  relatively lower proportion of PR expression and higher proportion of HER2\n\nover-expression  as opposed to the ER positive tumours  in our study  Table 5 are consistent\n\nwith more aggressive tumour biology as reported in previous studies[14  17–20] \n\nWith advancing age biological characteristics of breast cancer appear to change with high\n\nrate of ER positivity  PR positivity and low HER2 and Ki67 expression in general[3]  however\n\nthe extent of these changes is not yet clear in ER-negative tumours  Further studies in this\n\nregard are strongly recommended  Those patients with HER2 over-expressing tumours have\n\ntrastuzumab as a potential therapeutic option  However available evidence has primarily been\n\ndrawn from studies focusing on younger patients  with no or under-representation of older\n\nwomen and invariably all studies demonstrated the role of trastuzumab given in combination\n\nwith cytotoxic chemotherapy[21–23]  The presence of comorbidities  limited physiological\n\nreserve and lack of social support may make chemotherapy very challenging in this group of\n\npatients and trastuzumab mono-therapy could be very attractive though there is no evidence\n\nto support its use at present \n\nThe response to primary endocrine therapy appeared poor in general as compared to sur-\n\ngery  which is not unexpected due to the relatively low ER expression and PgR expression\n\nTable 5  Clinical outcome and expression of

However the use of primary endocrine therapy in this series was predominantly his-\n\ntorical  1970s and early 1980s mainly  Although primary radiotherapy has produced a com-\n\nparatively better outcome  it would be difficult to draw a definite conclusion given the small\n\npatient number  Nevertheless it could be considered as a therapeutic option for patients with\n\nvery limited life expectancy and when surgery is deemed inappropriate  Although there is lim-\n\nited data available showing the role of primary radiotherapy for early operable primary breast\n\ncancer which is normally treated by primary surgery  it has been used in locally advanced breast\n\ncancer[24]  Further studies in the future may be able to delineate its precise role in this selected\n\ngroup of elderly patients  Two studies reported on hypo-fractionated radiotherapy  single\n\nweekly dose of 6 5 Gy corresponding to 5 fractions  with total dose of 32 5–45 5 Gy  in combi-\n\nnation with tamoxifen 20 mg in older women  given as primary therapy because they refused\n\nsurgery for their newly diagnosed primary breast cancer [25  26]  Both studies included patients\n\nof 64 years and older with T1-4  N0-1  M0 disease with a sample size of 70  78% ER positive  in\n\none study and 115  68% ER positive  in the other  The study by Maher et al  at a median fol-\n\nlow-up of 36 months  reported 10 deaths  out of which eight were due to breast cancer  giving a\n\n3-year disease specific survival rate of 88%  Eleven patients developed loco-regional failure and\n\nanother 11 developed distant metastases  leaving 72% of patients disease free at the time of anal-\n\nysis [25]  The study by Courdi et al  at 41 months’ median follow-up  reported 15%  N = 19 \n\nlocal failure and 78% 5-year local progression free survival  while the 5-year breast cancer spe-\n\ncific survival rate was 71% [26]  Given that tamoxifen was used alongside radiotherapy in both\n\nstudies  it would be difficult to extract the precise effect of primary radiotherapy  Regardless\n\nthere is a possible role of radiotherapy  in full dose or in hypofractionation form  in this con-\n\ntext  but a definitive recommendation is not possible with such limited data \n\nIn conclusion  older women with ER negative early operable primary breast cancer\n\nappeared to have poor prognosis  however those treated by surgery or primary radiotherapy\n\nhad relatively better outcome  while primary endocrine therapy was associated with poor out-\n\ncome  Regardless of treatment the majority of patients died of breast cancer  The results of this\n\nstudy strongly recommend consideration of primary surgery in most patients if comorbidities\n\nallow  and further studies to explore the precise role of chemotherapy and trastuzumab  Other\n\nless toxic biological therapies should also be explored as potential therapeutic options  Primary\n\nradiotherapy may also be used as an alternative to surgery in selected cases  Hypofractionated\n\nschedules of radiotherapy  entailing far fewer hospital visits than previously given  are much\n\nmore attractive for these patients  and increasing hypofractionation  use of even fewer  but\n\nlarger individual fractions  is currently being evaluated in many centres \n\nSupporting information\nS1 File  Table A  Age Pattern  Table B  Clinical Size

cancer \n\nMethods\nAll patients consulting for inflammatory breast syndrome in the breast unit of our tertiary Uni-\nversity hospital between September 2013 and December 2015 were prospectively included \nWe excluded women who were pregnant or in the postpartum period  Patients underwent\nsystematic clinical examination and imaging  breast ultrasonography and mammography \nA biopsy was performed if the clinician suspected a malignant lesion of the breast  Clinico-\npathologic and radiologic data were registered  Statistics were performed using R  3 0 2 ver-\nsion  software \n\nResults\nAmong the 76 patients screened and included  38  50%  had a malignant lesion at final diag-\nnosis  21  27 6%  were diagnosed with infectious disease and 17  22 4%  with

nonpuerperal inflammatory breast\n\nsyndrome  we found that half of the patients had IBC  While clinical and radiological features\n\nmay help initial diagnosis  they are non-specific and follow-up and biopsy are mandatory in\n\ncase of persisting inflammatory breast despite treatment \n\nThis high rate of IBC is an important finding especially as it contrasts with two previous\n\nmain studies reporting inflammatory breast syndrome [1  5]  In 2009  Kamal et al  [5] found\n\nthat 5 6% of patients had IBC in a cohort of 197 patients with mastitis  Similarly  Froman et al \n\n[1] reported a rate of 4 5% of IBC in a cohort of 23 patients presenting with red breast syndrome\n\nafter screening more than 3700 women presenting at their breast unit over a 2-year period  The\n\nfirst probable explanation for such a difference is that  unlike these two studies  we excluded\n\nwomen who were pregnant or in the postpartum period from our cohort  Inflammatory breast\n\nduring breastfeeding is common and does not represent a challenge either for diagnosis or for\n\nTable 5  MRI analysis \nCharacteristics Number of patients\n\n n = 20 \nMissing data Infectious\n\n n = 1 \nInflammatory\n n =

improving management of women suffering with inflammatory breast syndrome \n\nWe believe that the high rate of IBC we report here is probably closer to what clinicians may\n\nencounter in everyday practice \n\nThe clinical distinction between true IBC and neglected breast cancer progression may\n\nprove delicate in some cases  This distinction is clinically relevant since the treatment strategy\n\nmight differ  In our cohort  we cannot exclude that some of the cases of IBC were in fact cases\n\nof neglected cancer progression  Some authors report clinical diagnostic differences between\n\nthese two scenario that are easily picked up on during physical examination [7  12–14]  For\n\nexample  patients with IBC may experience a rapid increase in breast volume almost simulta-\n\nneously with the skin changes which are highly evocative of IBC  in our cohort  skin thickening\n\nand indurated skin was observed in 55% and 73% of women with IBC  respectively  Most\n\npatients with IBC do not present a palpable mass on physical examination [14]  In our cohort \n\nhowever  the most relevant symptom suggestive of malignancy at the time of the consultation\n\nwas the perception of a mass  78 9%  on physical examination  Therefore  while this sign may\n\nbe unusual in IBC  any perception of a mass by the patient or the clinician warrants further\n\ninvestigation including systematic breast or skin biopsy in case of doubt \n\nBreast ultrasonography and a mammography were particularly useful diagnostic tools in\n\nour cohort  On ultrasonography  the only factor significantly associated with IBC was the pres-\n\nence of precise limits of the mass  Other authors report similar results [5  15]  However  a nor-\n\nmal ultrasonography does not in itself rule out IBC  Indeed  Gunhan et al  [16] reported\n\nabsence of a mass in 20% of authentic cases of IBC and no skin changes in 4% of those cases \n\nMammography is usually less specific to differentiate between mastitis and IBC  Crowe et al \n\n[17] reported that the most relevant sign of IBC was diffuse skin thickening  Mammography\n\nwas highly relevant in our cohort  As mentioned before  the presence of a mass  of calcifica-\n\ntions or of a focal asymmetry were significantly associated with a malignant lesion though not\n\nspecific of IBC  Several authors have assessed the performance of MRI for the diagnosis of IBC\n\n[16  18–20]  This exam is usually prescribed after ultrasonography and mammography in case\n\nof doubt  Sixteen patients with IBC underwent a breast MRI in our cohort  Presence of mass \n\nlocal enhancement and suspicious lymph nodes were strongly evocative of a malignant lesion \n\nWhile some authors [1  3] have developed algorithms for the management of inflammatory\n\nbreast  we believe that the need for such an algorithm is questionable  The main issue at hand\n\nis to rapidly identify all cases of IBC  a particularly aggressive cancer  in women presenting\n\nwith inflammatory breast syndrome  Unfortunately  our data were limited regarding the time\n\nlapse between first clinical contact and the diagnostic of an IBC in our cohort and we were not\n\nable to assess the efficiency of the management of such patients using French guidelines  Once\n\nIBC is identified  it should be treated as an emergency  Our efforts should thus focus on cor-\n\nrectly identifying these patients at high risk of metastasis and progression  We have identified\n\nfactors strongly associated with IBC which would allow clinicians to diagnose IBC in women\n\npresenting with inflammatory breast syndrome \n\nConclusion\nIBC is prevalent in women presenting with non-puerperal inflammatory breast syndrome and\n\nshould be the major concern of clinicians managing these patients  Clinical and imaging exam-\n\nination may be helpful for this purpose but further investigation by breast biopsy should be\n\nundertaken if the slightest doubt remains  We are currently developing a nomogram based on\n\nour results to identifying these high-risk patients with an aim to accelerate appropriate man-\n\nagement in this emergency setting \n\nA non-puerperal inflammatory breast cohort\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0189385 December 20  2017 9 / 11\n\n\n\n\nSupporting

for meta-\nstatic estrogen receptor  ER -positive and human epithermal growth factor 2  HER2 -nega-\ntive breast cancer  The nature of cell cycle inhibition by palbociclib suggests its potential in\nTNBC cells  Retinoblastoma  RB  a known substrate of CDK4/6  pathway deregulation is a\nfrequent occurrence in TNBC and studies have revealed that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhi-\nbition induces a cooperative cytostatic effect with doxorubicin in RB-proficient TNBC mod-\nels  In addition  recent studies reported that anti-androgen therapy shows preclinical\nefficacy in androgen-receptor  AR -positive TNBC cells  Here we examined the effect of pal-\nbociclib in combination with an anti-androgen enzalutamide in TNBC cells \n\nMethod\nMDA-MB-453  BT-549  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell

AR antagonists \n\nIntroduction\nTriple-negative breast cancer  TNBC  remains a challenging breast cancer subtype for its\n\nhigher risk of distant recurrence  and poorer outcome after recurrence or metastasis than\n\nother types of breast cancer [1–3]  Targeted therapy for TNBC is emerging in clinical trials and\n\nrecent molecular profiling studies have revealed molecular heterogeneity of TNBC [4] \n\nhighlighting the importance of finding biomarkers for targeted therapy guidance for TNBC \n\nPalbociclib is a highly selective cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6  CDK4/6  inhibitor \n\nwhich blocks the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein  pRB  and subsequently arrests\n\ncell cycle at G1-phase [5  6]  Previous study in vitro showed that palbociclib in combination\nwith hormone therapy  tamoxifen  or target therapy  trastuzumab  had an effectively inhibi-\n\ntory effect on ER-positive and HER2-amplified breast cancer  respectively [7]  In clinical  pal-\n\nbociclib in combination with letorzole  aromatase inhibitor  has been approved by the U S \n\nFood and Drug Administration  FDA  for the treatment of patients with ER-positive and\n\nHER2-negative advanced breast cancer [8  9]  However  the effects of palbociclib in TNBC are\n\nnot well-documented \n\nEnzalutamide  an androgen receptor antagonist  has been approved by the FDA for the\n\ntreatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer [10  11]  Cumulative evidences showed\n\nthat enzalutamide has potent anti-tumor effects on TNBC cells  and suggested that androgen\n\nreceptor  AR  might be a promising target for treatment of TNBC [12–14]  However  the effect\n\nof combination palbociclib with enzalutamide in TNBC cells is still unclear \n\nIn present study  we tested the combination effect of palbociclib with enzalutamide in\n\nTNBC cells  Cytostatic effects of enzalutamide  palbociclib or combined treatment and effects\n\nof treatments on AR and pRB proteins expressions were examined  Moreover  the influences\n\non cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were also evaluated \n\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and transfection\nHuman TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-453

with palbociclib enhances the cytostatic\neffect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells\nSince palbociclib is a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor  which blocks the phosphorylation of RB and\n\nsubsequently leads to inhibition of cell growth  we evaluated the effect of palbociclib in three\n\nTNBC cell lines  The result showed that palbociclib significantly inhibited the cell growth in RB-\n\nproficient cells  MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231  but not in RB-negative cells  MDA-MB-\n\n468   Fig 2A  Enzalutamide-suppressed cell viability of AR-positive cells is nearly 50%  Fig 2B \n\nTo examine whether enzalutamide enhanced palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect  we used 0 156\n\nor 2 5 μM palbociclib combined with various concentrations of enzalutamide in TNBC cell lines \nThe results revealed that enzalutamide enhanced the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-\n\npositive/RB-proficient  MDA-MB-453  cells rather than AR-positive/RB-negative  BT-549 \n\nAR-negative/RB-proficient  MDA-MB-231  AR-negative/RB-negative  MDA-MB-468  cells\n\nFig 2  Enzalutamide in combination with palbociclib enhances the cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBC cells   A  MDA-MB-453  BT-\n549  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with various concentrations of palbociclib   B  enzalutamide and  C  combination of 0 156 or 2 5 μM\npalbociclib and 10 or 20 μM enzalutamide for 72 h  the cell viability was determined using MTT assay  The means ± SEM of three independent experiments\nperformed in triplicate are shown  *P   10%\n\nnuclear staining [32]  The level of RB1 mRNA correlated with level of pRB [33] and RB is\n\nreported that lost in ~40% of TNBC [34]  Furthermore  pRB level was found that lost in most\n\nTNBC by IHC analysis [35]  Studies have identified that luminal androgen receptor  LAR \n\nsubtype of TNBC cell lines might be sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition [36  37]  Asghar et al  dem-\nonstrated that MFM223 and SUM185 cells were sensitive to palbociclib [37]  Indeed  these two\n\nLAR subtype cell lines harbored high level of pRB  The xenografts of LAR MDA-MB-453 cells\n\nwere significantly reduced by palbociclib treatment [37]  These findings supported AR positive\n\nand RB proficient TNBC were suitable for palbociclib treatment  In fact  a clinical trial of pal-\n\nbociclib in combination with bicalutamide  a non-steroidal AR inhibitor  for the treatment of\n\npatients with AR-positive TNBC is ongoing  ClinicalTrials gov Identifier  NCT02605486  In\n\nthe present study  palbociclib plus enzalutamide was found to effectively repress AR-positive/\n\nRB-proficient TNBC cell growth suggesting that co-expression of AR and RB might be a bio-\n\nmarker for combined treatment of palbociclib with enzalutamide in TNBC \n\nCurrent study has some limitation  first of all only four TNBC cell lines were used and there\n\nmight be other protein profile or mutants that can contribute to the differential effects of pal-\n\nbociclib and enzalutamide and combination in these cell lines  Furthermore  despite we\n\nshowed that knockdown RB attenuated palbociclib-mediated effect on AR+/RB+ MDA-MB-\n\n453 cells  the notion that combination effect of palbociclib and enzalutamide is most signifi-\n\ncant in AR+/RB+ MDA-MB-453 cells needs further mechanistic studies to validate that AR is\n\nessential for palbociclib-mediated cell cycle arrest in AR+/RB+ TNBC cells  Last but not the\n\nleast  our study is limited by lack of sufficient and consolidative clinical data to support the\n\npossible association between RB and AR  It is also not clear and inconclusive with regards to\n\nthe role of AR and RB expressions in TNBC tumors  More clinical studies are needed to\n\naddress or validate the biological association between AR and RB \n\nIn conclusion  we found that palbociclib effectively inhibited RB-proficient TNBC cell\n\ngrowth and the expression of AR might contribute for palbociclib-mediated G1 arrest  More-\n\nover  enzalutamide enhanced the palbociclib-induced cytostatic effect in AR-positive/RB-pro-\n\nficient TNBC cells indicating that palbociclib in combination with enzalutamide may be a\n\ntherapeutic strategy for AR-positive/RB-proficient TNBCs \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  The relationships between AR gene expression and clinical variables  The level 3\ndata of mRNA RSEM

the development of nationwide health and social insurance\nsystems in Korea  the rate of early diagnosis of breast cancer is\nincreasing  This is primarily due to expansion of health screening\nto

Moreover  55% of all\nnewly diagnosed breast cancer patients in 2014 had T0–T1 breast\ncancer [4] Accordingly  the rate of BCS for nonpalpable breast\ncancer is gradually increasing \nAs more cases of

did not use SUV data in our study \n\n\n\nSecond  we did not include data on the morphological changes of\nbone lesions as evident on CT images  A previous study by\nTateishi et al[29] showed that only PET changes predicted\nprogression of bone metastasis  CT changes did not  We thus\nfocused on metabolic changes on PET images  Third  the\nguideline for treatment of bone metastases was changed

expressed in breast\ncancer tissues  NLGN4X expression data for all breast cancer cell lines in the Cancer Cell\nLine Encyclopedia  CCLE  was analyzed  Correlation between NLGN4X levels and

immunofluorescence study of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells validated\nthat NLGN4X was increased in MDA-MB-231  Knockdown of NLGN4X expression by\nsiRNA decreased cell proliferation and

with this cancer remains 2 to 3\n\nyears [1]  Clinical management and treatment outcome in patients with breast cancer may\n\nvary due to its high heterogeneity at the histopathologic and molecular levels [2] as evident by\n\nclinicopathological characteristics and molecular markers  Breast cancer is a heterogeneous\n\ndisease that has been classified into five major biologically distinct intrinsic subtypes  luminal\n\nA  luminal B  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2  HER2  overexpressing  basal-like \n\nand normal-like [3]  Despite advances in early detection and understanding of the molecular\n\nbasis of breast cancer biology  about 40% of the patients with early-stage breast cancer have\n\nrecurrent and metastatic disease [4]  Improving our understanding of the molecular mecha-\n\nnisms of the metastatic process might also improve clinical management of the disease  Tumor\n\nmetastasis consists of a complex series of events including cell migration  invasion  adhesion\n\nand blood vessel formation  Initiation of metastasis requires invasion  which is enabled by epi-\n\nthelial to mesenchymal transition of cancer cells  The process of tissue invasion and metastasis\n\ninvolves a series of attachment and detachment events based on cell or substrate attachment [5] \n\nOne crucial step during tumor invasion is loss of cancer cells adhesiveness to the extracellular\n\nmatrix component of basement membrane and mesenchymal tissue  It is believed that these\n\ninvasive cells have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition  EMT  which is associ-\n\nated with increased expression of cell-adhesion molecules such as laminin  α6β4 integrins  and\nCD44 [6]  Cell junctions like adherens  septates and tight junctions play an important role in the\n\ncontrol of cell proliferation  intercellular barrier formation  cellular differentiation  survival  apo-\n\nptosis and angiogenesis [7]  Cell-adhesion molecules such as ICAM  CD146  and the glycopro-\n\ntein NMB play an important role in mediating metastasis [8–10]  Neuroligins constitute a family\n\nof neuronal transmembrane synaptic proteins whose structural and biochemical characteristics\n\nare indicative of a role in heterotypic cell adhesion [11  12]  The neuroligin  NLGN  gene family\n\nconsists of five members  NLGN1 at 3q26  NLGN2 at 17p13  NLGN3 at Xq13  NLGN4 at Xp22 \n\nand NLGN4Y at Yq11  [13]  Their large extracellular N-terminal domain is homologous to ser-\n\nine esterases  They are of great importance in mediating synapse formation in the central ner-\n\nvous system  and they interact with neurexins from the opposite side  in trans  of the synaptic\n\ncleft in a calcium-dependent manner [14]  Both proteins display a strong and selective synapse\n\nformation which promotes activity between neurons in vitro  When expressed in non-neuronal\ncells  they mediate synaptogenesis between the cells and the adjacent neurons [15  16]  Besides\n\nbeing neuronal proteins  neuroligins have been implicated in vascular remodeling during angio-\n\ngenesis [17]  Recent studies have shown a mitogenic effect of NLGN3 in glioma proliferation\n\nand progression [18]  Recent studies highlight the role of NLGN1 in stabilizing laminin interac-\n\ntion with integrins suggests the importance of this molecule in mediating cell adhesion  Other\n\nstudies have shown that NLGN1 is overexpressed in a metastatic model of prostate cancer and is\n\nresponsible for cell adhesion [19]  Our previous studies using a selection from a combinatorial\n\nrandom peptide library against breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines identified several peptides\n\n[20] mimicking neuroligin  NLGN-1  3 and NLGN4X  In this study  we sought to determine\n\nthe expression of NLGN4X  its relevance and functional significance in breast cancer \n\nMaterials and methods\nCell lines and culture conditions\nAll cell lines were obtained from

cells play an important role in the develop-\n\nment and progression of cancer  Cell adhesion molecules provide a mechanistic role in the\n\nprocess of cancer metastasis and invasion [25  26]  The metastatic event involves a series of\n\nconsecutive attachment and detachment events that are based on cell-to-cell and cell-to-sub-\n\nstrate interactions  Invasive tumor cells’ ability to reach the blood  lymph nodes  and distant\n\norgans depends highly on the adhesive interaction with the basement membrane and extracel-\n\nlular matrix of the target host organ  Several cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM 1  laminin\n\nand fibronectin have been associated with the invasive process  growth  and metastasis of\n\nbreast tumors  [27]  This is the first study to link the expression of neuronal cell adhesion mol-\n\necules  neuroligins  to breast cancer  Here we show that the expression of NLGN4X is signifi-\n\ncantly higher in several subset of breast cancer  according to the CCLE database  This was\n\nfurther confirmed with flow cytometry analysis on the two selected cell types that are represen-\n\ntative of different breast cancer cell subtypes and that express a range of NLGN4X  MCF-7\n\n ER+/PR+/HER2−/low NLGN4X  and MDAMB231  ER−/PR−/HER-/very high NLGN4X \nImmunofluorescence confocal microscopy of MDA-MB-231 cells with anti-NLGN4X anti-\n\nbody again confirmed the presence of NLGN4X  The bioinformatics Oncomine TGCA data\n\nrevealed that NLGN4X expression was increased in metastatic tissue  It is possible that\n\nNLGN4X can modulate the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells  and possibly play a role\n\nin the ability of cancer cells to metastasize to distant sites  These observations are supported by\n\nthe fact that NLGN4X expression predicts relapse-free breast cancer survival outcomes in\n\nFig 8  Effect of NLGN4X on cell migration and proliferation  A  Quantification of area migrated in NLGN4X knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells compared with\nscrambled

in\n\nbreast carcinoma and lymph node metastasis  30 out of 40 and 6 out of 10 breast cancer tissues\n\nand lymph node metastasis  respectively were positive for NLGN4X  We did not find any dif-\n\nference in staining of NLGN4X in ER+  PR+ vs ER-  PR- breast cancer tissues \n\nNLGN4X protein and mRNA was effectively down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells after\n\nsiRNA transfection  The NLGN4X siRNA-transduced cells showed inhibition in cell prolifera-\n\ntion and migration in MDA-MB-231  indicating the migration and proliferation of TNBC\n\ncells were regulated by NLGN4X expression  The decrease in proliferation was mediated by\n\ninduction of apoptosis by NLGN4X knockdown as evident by elevated levels of cleaved PARP\n\nand caspase 3/7 activity  The depletion of NLGN4X also resulted in an increase of cells in both\n\nthe early stages and late stages of apoptosis  These suggest the role of NLGN4X as being essen-\n\ntial for cancer cells survival \n\nBased on these data  it is a good possibility that and NLGN4X can be used as a biomarker\n\nfor breast cancer and for prediction of survival outcomes of patients with hormone positive \n\nHer+ subtype and ER-  basal subtype  To the best of our knowledge  this is the first study to\n\nevaluate the prognostic significance of neuroligins expression in breast cancer  Further\n\ndetailed studies are required to

paracortical hyperplasia com-\nposed of interdigitating dendritic cells  IDC  Langerhans cells \n LC  macrophages containing melanin pigment  and small T \ncells  Dermatopathic lymphadenitis is believed to represent \nan exaggerated response to increased antigenic stimulation \nin the skin [1] \n\nDermatopathic lymphadenitis is often seen in patients with skin \ndiseases  especially mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome [2]  \nDLN has also been associated with several viral diseases  es-\npecially Human Immunodeficiency Virus  HIV  [3] and Human \nPapilloma Virus HPV [4] \n\nAlthough DLN is a benign entity  its uncommon concurrence \nwith cancer may lead physicians to pursue unsolicited aggres-\nsive diagnostic and therapeutic measures  Hence  DLN should \nbe included in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy \nin malignancies \n\nCase Report\n\nA 56-year-old Hispanic female patient with past medical his-\ntory of stage III-B left breast invasive ductal carcinoma triple-\nnegative was diagnosed in 2010  She underwent modified \nradical mastectomy  axillary lymph node dissection  and neo-\nadjuvant TAC  docetaxel plus doxorubicin plus cyclophospha-\nmide  and radiation completed in 2010 \n\nReview of her medical history was significant for diabetes melli-\ntus type II  hypertension  dyslipidemia  normocytic anemia  and \nright brachiocephalic vein thrombosis managed with Coumadin \n\nIn 2016  the patient presented with diffuse lymphadenopa-\nthy involving bilateral axillary and inguinal lymph nodes  sus-\npicious for recurrence of malignancy  No fever  chills  or skin \nlesions were reported  Complete review of systems was not \ncontributory \n\nLab values were  hemoglobin  11 6 g/dL  Hct  36 2%  MCV  \n88 1 fL  WBC  4 85×103/µL  and PLt  219×103/µL  Vitals were  \nt  37 3°C  BP  128/72  P  97  RR  18 \n\nOn physical examination  generalized lymphadenopathy was \nnoted  which was more pronounced on the right axilla  No skin \nlesions or organomegaly were appreciated \n\nThe patient underwent multiple imaging modalities  Following \nthe initial presentation  a PET scan was performed  showing hy-\npermetabolic lymph nodes in the right axillary and subpectoral \n\nregion  worrisome for malignancy  a lateral right axillary lymph \nnode measured 1 4×1 1 cm with an SUVmax of 6 0  and a sub-\ncentimeter right interpectoral lymph node showed SUVmax of \n3 6  These lymph nodes were contralateral to the patient’s left \nbreast carcinoma  Subcentimeter mildly FDG-avid lymph nodes \nwere seen in the left axilla  A millimetric left axillary lymph node \nshowed SUVmax of 1 8  Mildly FDG-avid bilateral level IIA cer-\nvical lymph nodes were seen  the more prominent one on the \nright  showing SUVmax of 3 6 and measuring 7 mm in short axis \n\nMultiple hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen in the ret-\nroperitoneum  left paraaortic region  left common iliac chain  \nand left external iliac chain  A hypermetabolic node along \nthe posteromedial aspect of the left psoas muscle measured \n1 5 cm in diameter  with an SUVmax of 8 3  A left external ili-\nac lymph node measured 2 1×1 5 cm with an SUVmax of 5 2  \nThe pattern of nodal disease was very suggestive of lympho-\nma  which may be an incidental finding in this patient with a \nhistory of breast cancer \n\nInterestingly  diffuse mildly increased tracer uptake was seen \nthroughout the spleen  which may have been related to ex-\ntramedullary hematopoiesis secondary to anemia or lympho-\nmatous infiltration \n\nHence  a subsequent right axillary lymph node needle core bi-\nopsy was performed and revealed follicular and interfollicu-\nlar lymphoid hyperplasia  without malignancy  The lymphade-\nnopathy persisted  so a follow-up abdomen and pelvis CT scan \nwith contrast was done and showed slightly enlarged left com-\nmon iliac lymph nodes  Figure 1  with subcentimeter paraaor-\ntic lymph nodes  Figure 2 \n\nA PET scan done at 4-month interval revealed progression \nof lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm  with sta-\nble diffuse increased uptake in the spleen  which could repre-\nsent lymphoproliferative disorder  or an infectious or inflam-\nmatory process \n\nConcurrent left inguinal lymph node needle core biopsy dem-\nonstrated follicular and interfollicular hyperplasia  Figure 3  \nscattered pigmented macrophages  Figure 4  and rare eo-\nsinophils  suggestive of dermatopathic lymphadenitis with-\nout malignancy \n\nA scheduled screening right breast mammogram showed no \nevidence of right breast malignancy  with interval enlargement \nof intramammary lymph nodes in the upper outer quadrant re-\nlated to known lymphoproliferative process  with stable right \naxillary lymphadenopathy  Follow-up chest  abdomen  and pel-\nvis CT scans revealed minimal interval increase in size of left \naxillary lymph nodes  as well as stable mildly enlarged retro-\nperitoneal and left external iliac lymph nodes

interval \nresolution of the previously noted diffuse increased uptake of \ntracer by the spleen  A final right axillary lymph node needle \ncore biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of dermatopathic lymph-\nadenitis without malignancy  Spontaneous resolution of der-\nmatopathic lymphadenitis was achieved without any further \nintervention or treatment \n\nDiscussion\n\nDermatopathic lymphadenitis  also known as lipomelanotic re-\nticulosis  or Pautrier–Woringer disease  is a rare type of benign \nlymphatic hyperplasia associated with a variety of exfoliative \nor eczematoid type inflammatory erythrodermas  The axillary \n\nand inguinal regions are most commonly affected  although \noccasionally it can present in the head and neck as well [5] \n\nDLN is often seen in patients with skin diseases  especially \nmycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome  but has rarely been \ndescribed in the absence of clinical skin disease  DLN was \nfirst coined by Hurwitt et al  The relationship between lymph \nnode hyperplasia and cutaneous disease was first described \nby Wise et al  although it was later established by Pautrier \nand Woringer as lipomelanotic reticulosis [6 7] \n\nIn adults and children  there is a range of non-neoplastic  \nnon-infectious etiologies for lymphadenopathy  These in-\nclude reactive lymphoid hyperplasia  RLH  dermatopathic \nlymphadenitis  DLN  Rosai- Dorfman disease  Castleman dis-\nease  Kimura disease  Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease  and lymph-\nadenopathy associated with autoimmune and metabolic/\nstorage disease  Differentiating between these nodal enti-\nties and diagnosing DLN is mostly based on the lymph node \nbiopsy  FNA  [8] 18F-FDG PET/CT  as a sensitive and noninva-\nsive whole-body imaging technique  can also be used as a \nvaluable aid in the diagnostic workup [9]  In a review by Hu \net al  of F-FDG PET/CT characteristics in malignancies vs  be-\nnign lymphadenopathy  the SUV max  of malignant tumors \n 6 3±2 4  was significantly greater than that of benign lesions \n 2 9±2 0   P<0 001  Receiver-operating characteristic curve \nanalysis showed that the SUVmax cutoff value of 3 5 had a \n\nFigure 3   Lymph node with follicular

on fine-needle aspiration cytology include melanin-lad-\nen macrophages with variable pigment  large  histiocytic clus-\nters with blood vessels at the center  characteristic histiocytes \nwith elongated vesicular nuclei  nuclear grooves  crumpled and \nconvoluted nuclei  and pseudonucleoli  and absence of or very \nfew tingible body macrophages  Positivity on immunostaining \nfor S-100 and negativity for CD68 aid in the diagnosis [11] \n\nIn our case  distinguishing DLN and breast cancer lymph node \ninvolvement depended on multiple characteristics  PET scan \nfindings of higher SUVmax in malignancies compared to benign \nlymphadenopathy  and the tendency of breast cancer to metas-\ntasize to regional axillary lymph nodes in contrast to the ten-\ndency of DLN to have widespread involvement of lymph nodes \n\nReferences \n\n 1   Miranda RN  Khoury JD  Medeiros LJ  Dermatopathic \nLymphadenopathy  In  Atlas of Lymph Node Pathology  Miranda RN  Khoury \nJD  Medeiros LJ  eds

cancer recurrence  This should be taken into consideration \nwhen evaluating lymphadenopathy in patients with a cancer \nhistory  as this presentation may not always be due to infec-\ntion or malignancy  but can be due to a reactive condition such \nas DLN [6]  making the differential diagnosis of DLN an impor-\ntant entity to keep in mind  even in the absence of skin lesions \n\nThis case also suggests that extensive workup in an asymp-\ntomatic patient with initial negative findings for malignancy \nrecurrence is of low diagnostic yield due to the benign course \nand spontaneous resolution of this disease \n\nConflicts of interest\n\nNone \n\n 6  Srinivasamurthy BC  Saha K  Senapati S  Saha A  Fine needle aspiration cy-\ntology of dermatopathic lymphadenitis in an

left ventricular\nremodeling [3 4] our ﬁndings of inconsistence between MR and\nventricular remodeling argued against that explanation  Similar-\nly  Allen et al[2] showed that MR occurs more often in children\nafter anthracycline exposure compared to normal controls \nand may herald the later development of overt anthracycline\ncardiomyopathy \nAnother explanation for the incipient MR is that the valvular\n\naging process may be accelerated by anthracycline toxicity MR is\nseen in a considerable proportion of the general population and is\nthought to be related to aging [9 10] Klaus et al[4] found that age\n>50 years at primary treatment was an independent risk factor\nfor valvular dysfunction in lymphoma patients  In our case  MV\nthickening was observed in the TTEs after the onset of symptoms \nwhich suggested that degenerative changes in the mitral valves\nplayed a role in the development of MR \nMechanisms underlying anthracycline-induced myocardial\n\ndamage are still less

the high cost and\n\nregional availability of these kits [4]  Thus  identifying prognostic breast cancer biomarkers\n\nthat are low-cost and easily obtainable via routine blood counts is of great importance \n\nPlatelet activation has been shown to be common in cardiovascular diseases such as acute\n\nischemic stroke  myocardial infarction  and renal artery stenosis [5]  Recently  more attention\n\nhas been focused on the clinical significance of platelet activation in several malignancies [6] \n\nPlatelet-derived growth factor-receptor  PDGF-R  is involved in cancer invasion and metasta-\n\nses  Indeed  elevated PDGF and PDGF-R levels in several tumor tissues are negative prognostic\n\nfactors [7–11]  We have also shown that platelet-related markers  such as the platelet-to-lym-\n\nphocyte ratio  PLR  are significant prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer [12 13] \n\nLarger platelets store more granules and receptors  and adhere more rapidly than smaller\n\nones  Thus  the platelet’s activity is more accurately represented by their size  not count [14] \n\nPlatelet size can be inferred from the platelet volume indices  PVIs  including the platelet dis-\n\ntribution width  PDW  mean platelet volume  MPV  platelet distribution width-to-platelet\n\ncount ratio  PDW/P  and mean platelet volume-to-platelet count ratio  MPV/P  PDW\n\nreflects the variation and heterogeneity in platelet size  and is used in the differential diagnosis\n\nof thrombocytopenia [15]  MPV is an indicator of activated platelets and is linked to various\n\ninflammatory conditions [16]  Both PDW and MPV are routinely measured by automated\n\ncommon blood count analyzers  Recent studies revealed that MPV and MPV/P levels are asso-\n\nciated with poor prognoses in esophageal  breast  hepatocellular  and lung carcinomas [17–\n\n21]  However  to the best of our knowledge  the prognostic values of PDW and PDW/P in\n\npatients with breast cancer has not been reported \n\nHence  the purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of the PVIs on the DFS rates of\n\npatients with localized breast cancer to determine their prognostic significance \n\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis was a retrospective study of 327 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer who\n\nunderwent surgery at the Department of Thoracic and

associated with a poor prognosis\n\n[12 13]  To the best of our knowledge  ours is the first study to demonstrate the value of PDW/\n\nP as an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients  Our findings may provide\n\nimportant supporting information to inform treatment decisions and predict treatment\n\noutcomes \n\nMPV and PDW are morphometric indices as well as quantitative measures of size distribu-\n\ntion and variability of platelets  in general  the two are inversely proportional [27]  and can be\n\nutilized to differentiate between hypoproductive and hyperdestructive thrombocytopenia \n\nrespectively [28]  PDW is a more specific marker of platelet activation  because it does not\n\nincrease owing to platelet swelling [29]  There are pronounced contraindicatory results regard-\n\ning the relationship between MPV and prognosis in various cancers  Some studies found that\n\nelevated MPV levels significantly correlate with unfavorable prognoses in esophageal [17] \n\nbreast [18]  and hepatocellular [19] carcinoma  On the other hand  reduced MPV and MPV/P\n\nwere independent predictors of negative prognosis in lung cancer patients [20  21]  Hence  the\n\npublished literature regarding the value of MVP as a prognostic factor is inconclusive  PDW\n\nmay therefore be a more reliable and accurate prognostic marker than MPV in cancer\n\npatients \n\nThe reason for the poor prognosis of patients with high PDW/P is unclear  Platelet vol-\n\nume is determined both during megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis  PDW is an indicator\n\nTable 4

in TNM staging  and prognosis is\nwell recognized  According to TNM  tumors classified as T2  could have very different vol-\numes  e g  a tumor of 2 1 cm has a volume of 4500 mm3  while a tumor of 4 9 cm has a vol-\nume of 60 000 mm3 even belonging to the same class  The aim of the study is to establish if\nthe prognostic role of tumor size  expressed as diameter and volume  has been overshad-\nowed by other factors \n\nMethods\nThe primary objective is to evaluate the association between tumor dimensions and overall\nsurvival  OS  / disease free survival  DFS  in our institution from January 1st 2005 to Sep-\ntember 30th 2013 in a surgical T1-T2 population  Volume was evaluated with the measure-\nment of three half-diameters of the tumor  a  b and c  and calculated using the following\nformula  4/3π x a x b x c \n\nResults\n341 patients with T1-T2 EBC were included  86 5% were treated with conservative surgery \n85 1% had a Luminal subtype  9 1% were Triple negative and 7 4% were HER2 positive \nMedian volume was 942 mm3  range 0 52–31 651 2  44 patients  12 9%  relapsed and 23\npatients died  With a median follow-up of 6 5 years  the univariate analysis for DFS showed\nan association between age  tumor size  volume  histological grading and molecular sub-\ntype  The multivariate analysis confirmed the statistically significant association only for\nmolecular subtype  p 0 005  with a worse prognosis for Triple negative and HER2 positive\nsubtypes compared with Luminal  HR  2 65  95%CI  1 34–5 22  Likewise for OS  an associ-\nation was shown by the

strongly influences survival is molecular subtype \nThese findings encourage clinicians to choose adjuvant treatment not based on dimensional\ncriteria but on biological features \n\nIntroduction\nBreast Cancer  BC  is the most frequent malignancy in the Italian female population  with\n\n50 000 new cases in 2016 [1]  BC has always been staged using the American Joint Committee\n\non Cancer  AJCC  TNM  Tumor Nodes Metastasis  system  developed in 1959 and periodi-\n\ncally reviewed till the update to the current seventh edition  The role of T  tumor  dimension\n\nhas always been well established  and the correlation between T size and patients’ survival was\n\nlinear and independent from nodal status [2]  Nowadays the prognosis of early breast cancer\n\n EBC  is not related only to the anatomical extension of the disease but it depends on some\n\nbiological features  concerning intrinsic tumor behaviour such as hormone receptor expres-\n\nsion  estrogen and progesterone receptor  HER2 positive expression  ki-67 status and histo-\n\nlogical grading  In clinical practice  the expression or the absence of these elements allows us\n\nto distinguish between different cancer subtypes  Luminal A  Luminal B  HER2 positive and\n\nTriple negative breast cancers  which require different therapeutic approaches [3]  The\n\nstrength of molecular subtyping is well recognised and is constantly evolving  several sub-\n\ngroups are being identified and new therapies are becoming available \n\nIn this new scenario  a deeper reflection on T role is warranted and it is necessary to estab-\n\nlish how its prognostic role has evolved in these last years with the use of biological classifica-\n\ntions in clinical practice  T is represented by the largest diameter of the invasive cancer\n\ncomponent  it has been adopted by the TNM classification because it is easy to obtain and is\n\nconsidered the best way to measure the risk of cancer metastases and recurrence  However  it\n\nmay not be representative of the real tumor burden  in fact the amount of cancer cells is better\n\ndescribed by an approximation of the Tumoral Volume  TV  obtained by the ideal ellipsoid\n\ngenerated from the three spatial dimensions of the invasive tumor measured at the surgical\n\npathology examination [4]  In fact  turning from a one-dimensional to a three-dimensional\n\napproach  neoplasms sharing the same greatest length do differ one another due to variation of\n\ntheir height and width \n\nTo assess the appropriate value of the T parameter it’s important to wonder if the currently\n\nused largest diameter is effectively the best prognostic model \n\nMaterials and methods\nThis is a monoinstitutional  observational study conducted in ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco \n\nPresidio Fatebenefratelli  in Milan  Italy  The study was approved by the local Ethical Com-\n\nmettee  “Milano Area B”  The aim of the current study is to explore the prognostic T role in\n\nEBC in the era of molecular medicine  using both the largest diameter and TV  to understand\n\nif the morphologic parameter is still more relevant than biological features in predicting sur-\n\nvival  DFS and OS \n\nThe main inclusion criteria were  presence of histologically confirmed invasive T1-T2\n\nbreast cancer and no evidence of axillary node metastatic involvement  clinical and/or ultra-\n\nsound detection  Exclusion criteria were  male gender  bilateral breast cancer  multicentricity\n\nTumor size and prognosis in early breast

underwent breast surgery from\n\nJanuary 1st 2005 to September 30th 2013  We collected data on primary tumor  including histo-\n\nlogic type  histologic grading  ki-67  estrogen receptor  ER  and

positive follow-\n\ning the Maisonneuve classification  Tumor size was calculated both as maximum diameter\n\n according to TNM  in mm and as volume in mm3 \n\nThe surgical sample was always received fresh for immediate pathological evaluation and\n\nsampling  The area containing the tumor was sectioned in sequence at the pathology bench\n\nwith an interval of about 3 mm and block locations recorded [5]  The entire tumor was\n\nblocked out in such a way that the location of each block could be determined  Tissue slices\n\nwere then fixed and embedded in paraffin as routine  The calculation of the three dimensions\n\n in millimetres  of the invasive component of the tumor was based upon histological examina-\n\ntion of haematoxylin-and-eosin stained paraffin sections prepared from the sequential blocks \n\nThe maximum length was obtained by summing up the number of histological tissue slices\n\ncontaining the invasive tumor  while the maximum depth and width were measured by light\n\nmicroscopic examination of the sequential histological slides  Once we obtained these three\n\nmeasurements  we assumed that the tumor shape was approximately like a tri-axial ellipsoid\n\nwith distinct semi axis lengths a> b> c  so the volume of this solid can be calculated using the\n\nformula 4/3π x a x b x c \n\nStatistical analysis\nPatient and tumor characteristics

after 5 years and 87% patients have no disease relapse  This\n\ngood prognosis may depend on the use of adjuvant treatment  both radiotherapy  hormone\n\ntherapy and chemotherapy  In particular we observed that many patients with a Luminal\n\nmolecular profile  22 4% of the population  underwent adjuvant chemotherapy  which could\n\nexplain this result \n\nMolecular subtyping becomes both a prognostic and a predictive factor and that’s why this\n\nvariable is so strong in our results  These findings encourage clinicians to choose adjuvant\n\ntreatment not based on dimensional criteria

types could be\n\ntreated by conventional therapeutic method  conversely  there is no treatment for most inva-\n\nsive types yet  Therefore  finding an efficient  biocompatible and cost-effective therapeutic\n\nagent against the most invasive breast cancers is a serious challenge from the clinical point of\n\nview [1]-[2] \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Cu based products have been approved for human usage by US\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency since February 2008 [3]  This approval could be due to the\n\nfact that Cu is an essential trace element with the vital role in abundant metabolic and physio-\n\nlogical processes of human beings  Because of its bioactivity  it is increasingly being used in the\n\nproduction of copper-based nanoparticles  Furthermore  Cu nanoparticles  CuNPs  have par-\n\nticularly shown high toxicity against tumor cells such as pulmonary adenocarcinoma  A549 \n\nand human leukemia monocytic cell lines  THP-1  [4] [5]  It was shown that the cytotoxic\n\neffect of CuNPs in nano-scale is more effective than that in micro-scale [6]  Therefore  it seems\n\nthat the CuNPs based products in nano-scale have the potential to be used as the chemother-\n\napy drug  On the other hand  it is considered as a general rule that the apoptosis inducing\n\nagents are the only cytotoxic molecules that can be used as chemotherapeutic drugs [7] \n\nApoptosis is a type of cell death with the programmed sequence of events that cause cell\n\nmortality without releasing harmful substances toward the adjacent cells  Apoptosis normally\n\noccurs during differentiation and development  also it has an important role in response to a\n\nvariety of environmental stress such as cytotoxic agents and removal of tumor cell [8]  Cyto-\n\ntoxic drug-induced cells damage  particularly nuclear changes  activates apoptosis via either\n\nthe intrinsic or extrinsic mechanism [8]  One of the observed symptoms in treated cells with\n\nanticancer drugs is generation of reactive oxygen species  ROS  [9]  The thus produced ROS\n\nhas dual roles  induction of cell proliferation in the normal situation and apoptosis induction\n\nin the stressed condition [10] \n\nTo design an effective chemotherapeutic drug  it is absolutely essential to target cancer cells\n\nwith minimal toxicity toward the normal cells  Albumin nanoparticles as carriers for targeted\n\ndelivery of chemotherapeutic drugs  have attracted much attention due to the fact that they\n\nincrease endocytic uptake of the drugs [11] by rather cancer cells than normal cells  This is\n\nfirstly due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect  EPR phenomenon  of albumin\n\nnanoparticles mediated by the passive uptake of albumin in the tumor cells  Secondly  albumin\n\nnanoparticles enhance active absorption of a drug by the tumor cells via albumin receptor \n\nConsequently  a variety of drug delivery systems based on albumin have been attempted\n\nincluding albumin-binding drug derivatives  drug-albumin conjugates  prodrugs and albumin\n\nnanoparticles [12]  Another advantage of albumin nanoparticles is the elimination of cremo-\n\nphor and ethanol as organic solvents as well as emulsifiers due to the increased drug solubility\n\n[13]  Serum albumin  as the most abundant blood protein has many important functions\n\nincluding maintenance of blood pH  osmotic pressure  and transportation of different types of\n\nendogenous and exogenous molecules [14]  Features such as various binding sites for a large\n\nnumber of drugs  high half-life in the blood circulation  great solubility and stability  albumin\n\nhas attracted considerable attention  Because of more than 70% structural similarity  bovine\n\nserum albumin  BSA  has been used as an alternative for human serum albumin  HSA  Fur-\n\nthermore  it is biocompatible  stable  and readily accessible at a much lower price as compared\n\nwith HSA [15  16] \n\nIn the present report  the novel albumin-based nanocarrier of CuNPs abbreviated as\n\nACuNPs was synthesized  The structural properties of ACuNPs were studied via different\n\nspectroscopy methods  Then  their anticancer properties against MDA-MB 231 as invasive\n\nAlbumin-copper nanoparticle against breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal

the reaction vial and\n\nlowering the pH from 7 to 5 5 indicate the CuNPs formation  The solution was removed from\n\nthe heat and stirred until it cooled down to room temperature  The chemical

cytometry was used to quantitatively determine apoptosis and\n\nnecrotic cell population  An early marker of apoptosis is protrusions of phosphatidylserine\n\n PS  to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane  Phycoerythrin  PE  annexin-V is a fluores-\n\ncent-labeled dye which can bind very specifically to PS on the surface of cells  leading to detec-\n\ntion of early apoptotic cells  The loss of membrane integrity which is preceded by PE Annexin-\n\nV staining shows the latest stages of cell death consequential from either apoptotic or necrotic\n\nprocesses  7-Amino-Actinomycin  7-AAD  is a vital dye to allow detection of early apoptotic\n\ncells  7-AAD negative  Viable cells with intact membranes reject 7-AAD  while the mem-\n\nbranes of damaged and dead cells absorb it  Therefore  annexin-V and 7-AAD negative cells\n\nare viable  PE annexin-V positive and 7-AAD negative cells are early apoptotic cells and both\n\nPE annexin-V and 7-AAD positive cells are late apoptotic  and PE annexin-V negative and\n\n7-AAD positive cells are necrotic cells  The degree of apoptosis in cells exposed to CuNPs and\n\nACuNPs was quantified by PE annexin-V and 7-AAD staining using flow cytometry  After\n\nincubation  300 μl binding buffer was added to each sample  and cells were kept on ice  Data\nanalysis was performed using Flowjo software  version 7 6 1 [19] \n\n2 10 Flow cytometry based cell cycle assay\nPropidium iodide  PI  was used for DNA staining to determine cell cycle phase  Approxi-\n\nmately 6×106 cells/well of MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 60×15 mm SPL cell culture\ndishes and kept at 37˚C  5% CO2 for 24 h  Then  the cells were treated with IC50 of CuNPs and\n\nACuNPs and again incubated for 24 h at 37˚C  5% CO2  The cells were detached  centrifuged \n\nwashed with PBS  fixed in 70% cold ethanol  and stored at 4˚C for at least 12 h  The cells were\n\nwashed with PBS and treated by PI in RNase  40 μg ml−1 of PI in 100 μg ml−1 of RNase A  and\nincubated at 37˚C for 30 min  Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACS Calibur at\n\nan excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 610 nm  The data collected\n\nfor 10000 cells were analyzed using Flowjo software \n\n2 11 Cellular ROS assay\nThe level of intracellular ROS was assayed by a fluorescent dye of DCFHDA  After entering in\n\nto the cell  DCFHDA would be oxidized by ROS into a fluorogenic substrate named as 2’ 7’-\n\ndichlorofluorescein  DCF  There is a direct relationship between fluorescence intensity of\n\nDCF and the level of intracellular ROS [22]  DCF is detected via fluorescence spectroscopy\n\nwith excitation and emission wavelength of 495 and 525 nm  respectively [23]  In order to\n\nassay the intracellular ROS  approximately 3 5×105 MDA-MB-231 cells/well were seeded in\n24-well plates and kept at 37˚C  5% CO2  for 24 h  Then  they were treated with CuNPs and\n\nACuNPs for 24 h at the same conditions  As for ROS positive control  a freshly prepared\n\nhydrogen peroxide  0 1 mM in PBS  solution was used  10 μM DCFHDA was added to each\nwell of treated cells and incubated at 37˚C  5% CO2  for 1 h followed by twice washing with\n\nPBS  500 μl PBS was added to each well and homogenized carefully  Finally  the fluorescent\nintensity was measured [22] \n\nAlbumin-copper nanoparticle against breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE |

groups  with 5 mice in each\n\ngroup  4T1  a highly malignant of mammary carcinoma cell line of murine  were used to\n\ninduce cancer in mice  subcutaneously between the two ends of the mammary gland  The\n\nfirst group  normal control group  did not receive any injections  neither 4T1 cells nor\n\nACuNPs treatment  Group 2 was treated only by ACuNPs  Groups 3  4 and 5 were injected by\n\n1×106

3–4 mm  Group 5 was exposed to a 4T1 cell line and ACuNPs\n\ntogether to study prevention role of from tumor incidence  Groups 4 and 5 were the main\n\ntreatment groups  It should be noted that molarity of ACuNPs was based on CuNPs concen-\n\ntration  not BSA \n\n3  Results\n3 1 Characterization of the synthesized CuNPs\nTo verify the formation of CuNPs  UV–Vis spectroscopy was used  In the spectrum of the syn-\n\nthesized CuNPs  two strong and wide peaks were detected at around 230 and 260 nm  Fig 2 \n\nThe absorption spectrum of colloidal CuNPs at around 230 and 260 nm is due to the excitation\n\nof surface plasmon vibrations  200–300 nm  [24  25]  The particle size histogram obtained by\n\nDLS  Fig 2  indicates that CuNPs vary in size from 2 8 to 4 8 nm  mean diameter of 3 3 nm\n\nand the polydispersity index of 0 66  TEM image of synthesized CuNPs shows that they have\n\nspherical shapes with diameters around 5 nm  Fig 2 \n\n3 2 Characterization of the synthesized ACuNPs\nTEM images of ACuNPs  Fig 3A  revealed 100 nm spherical particles with rather smooth bor-\n\nders containing plenty of black spots inside  It seems that the black spots are CuNPs

so condensed  they seem black  but the protein\n\nmolecules around them seem rather transparent  DLS graph  Fig 3C  indicates that the diameter\n\nof ACuNPs varies from 52 5 to 83 5 nm  mean diameter  62 7 nm  with good homogeneity\n\n PDI 0 36  DLS results verify the information obtained by TEM \n\nOn the other hand  considering the fact that an albumin molecule has an effective diameter\n\nof 7 2 nm  Fig 3B  and the diameter of CuNPs is around 3 3 nm  one may conclude that each\n\nACuNPs contain several CuNPs and BSA molecules  ANPs were 46 6 nm in diameter  Fig\n\n3D  Therefore  at least 7 molecules of BSA are engaged in each ANPs  According to the same\n\ncondition for synthesizing ANPs and ACuNPs  increasing the diameter from 46 to 62 nm is a\n\nresult of embedding CuNPs inside BSA nanoparticle \n\nThe yield percentage of the synthesized ACuNPs  y  was calculated using Eq 3 as 96% \n\ny ¼ 100 \nWeight of ACuNPs\n\nTotal weight of BSAþ CuNPs\n\n   \n\nð3Þ\n\nFig 3  TEM images of

against breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188639 November 29  2017 8 / 21\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for such a high yield is that no washing was performed in the synthesis process \n\nand therefore  all raw materials are converted into products  This high yield suggests that the\n\nsynthesis of the nanoparticles is economically efficient  and we estimate that their industrial\n\nproduction efficiency might even be higher  The 4% loss in yield is related to the loss of mate-\n\nrial during displacement between containers  which could be minimized in industrial-scale \n\n3 2 1 Zeta potential  The zeta potential could be considered as a significant indicator for\n\nshowing the stability of the synthesized ACuNPs  The magnitude of zeta potential indicates the\n\ndegree of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent nanoparticles  D  Hanaor and R  W \n\na´O’Brien reported that particles with charges from ±10 to ±30 are generally found to be stable\n[26  27] \n\nThe zeta potential for CuNPs was measured to be -16 25 ± 0 53 mV  which is probably due\nto citrate anions  This charge seems to be large enough to protect the particles from aggrega-\n\ntion  Moreover  in the case of ACuNPs  since the small CuNPs are embedded inside the large\n\nBSA clusters  the dominant potential of ACuNPs would still be negative  The isoelectric point\n\nvalue of BSA is 4 7 therefore it is negatively charged at pH 7 4  So  the zeta potential for\n\nACuNPs was measured to be -10 76 ± 0 51 mV \n3 2 2 Absorption spectroscopy  Embedding of CuNPs in BSA cluster was further con-\n\nfirmed by UV-vis absorption spectra as shown in Fig 4A  solid line  The primary analysis of\n\nsynthesized nanomaterials by UV–vis spectroscopy has proven to be a very valuable technique\n\nfor characterization of nanomaterials [28  29]  The suspension of CuNPs in PBS  1 mM  illus-\n\ntrates two peaks at 230 and 260 nm  Fig 4  triangle-line  These peaks are originated from the\n\nsurface plasmon resonance of colloidal copper  Fig 4  dashed line  shows that the strong\n\nabsorption of BSA near 280 nm is due to the presence of tryptophan [30]  As seen  the UV-visi-\n\nble absorption spectra of BSA and ACuNPs are very close to each other  This indicates that no\n\nsignificant change was happened in the BSA of ACuNPs  On the other hand  the loss of plas-\n\nmon peak at 260 nm supports the idea that CuNPs are hidden deep in BSA \n\n3 2 3 Emission spectroscopy  The emission spectrum is informative for molecular envi-\n\nronment in the vicinity of tryptophan residues [31]  Fig 4B illustrates the fluorescent emission\n\nspectra of ANPs  ACuNPs  and BSA upon excitation at 295 nm  As seen  the emission spectra\n\nof ACuNPs and ANPs are close to each other  but BSA shows much higher intensity  The\n\ndecrease in the emission is related to the deep diving of tryptophan residues  More decreasing\n\nof the intensity in ACuNPs relative to ANPs could be due to the exposure of tryptophan resi-\n\ndues to the hydrophilic environment produced by metallic nanoparticles  CuNPs  The data\n\nobtained from fluorescence spectroscopy is in agreement with molar ellipticity increment in\n\nnear-UV CD spectroscopy \n\n3 2 4 Circular dichroism spectroscopy  Evaluation of the extent of the conformational\n\nchanges of BSA during the process of nanoparticle synthesis was done by CD spectroscopy  As\n\nshown in Fig 4D  the α-helix structure in ACuNPs and ANPs are almost similar to those in the\nnative state  This was verified by spectral deconvolution using CDNN program version 2  The\n\nresults are consistent with 1–2% rise in β-strand and 4–6% reduction in α-helix when the pro-\ntein is incorporated into nanoparticle assemblies  Fig 4D  Insert table  Since there is such a\n\nsmall change  we may conclude that BSA structure remained almost intact during the process\n\nfor ACuNPs synthesis \n\nFurthermore  tertiary structure changes in Fig 4C represents the typical CD spectrum of\n\nnative BSA which is in agreement with the spectrum reported in the literature [32]  As seen \n\nthis spectrum is almost conserved in ACuNPs \n\nIn addition  a shoulder is observed at 255–265 nm of CD spectrum which is the fingerprint\n\nof BSA tertiary structure  This fingerprint is visible in all cases of native BSA  ACuNPs  and\n\nANPs suggesting no drastic change happened around tyrosine and tryptophan residues \n\nAlbumin-copper nanoparticle against breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188639 November 29  2017 9 / 21\n\n\n\n\nHowever  the small increase in the molar ellipticity of ANPs and ACuNPs could be attributed\n\nto the slight unfolding which occurs in BSA tertiary structure during the high-pressure\n\nhomogenization process \n\n3 3 Cytotoxicity assay\nAs observed in Fig 1A and 1B  ANPs did not exert toxicity on cancer and normal cells  so they\n\ncould have the potential to act as non-toxic drug carriers for cells  The effect of CuNPs on can-\n\ncer cells showed that they induced cytotoxic effect at higher concentration  IC50 80 μM  This\ncould be due to the fact that copper is an essential micronutrient involved in all major meta-\n\nbolic pathways  but at higher concentrations  copper may interfere with a variety of cell functions\n\nincluding catalytic  structural and regulatory activities  resulting in inhibition of proliferation\n\n Fig 1A  The effect of CuNPs on normal cells  Fig 1B  showed only dose-dependent cytotoxic\n\neffect with IC50 of 109 μM  The pattern of ACuNPs effect on cancer cells  Fig 1A  was similar to\nthat of the CuNPs with IC50 of 70 μM  The cytotoxic effect of both CuNPs and ACuNPs against\nMDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells was dose-dependent  The cytotoxicity of copper nanoparticles\n\non cancer cell is accelerated by placing CuNPs in albumin nanoparticles carrier  possibly due to\n\nFig 4  A  UV-Vis  B  Emission fluorescence  C  Far-UV

done by an MTT cyto-\n\ntoxicity test on MCF-10A  a non-tumourigenic human breast epithelial cell type as a control cell\n\nline  Fig 1B  The results showed that ACuNPs inhibited the proliferation of human normal\n\nMCF-10A breast cells at higher concentration than the 400 μM concentration at which they\ninhibited the cancer cells  In fact  the presence of BSA as the carrier of CuNPs intensified the dif-\n\nference between cytotoxicity effect in cancer and normal cells  Cytotoxicity of ACuNPs against\n\nbreast cancer cells was 5 7 times more severe than their cytotoxicity against normal cells  while\n\nthis difference for CuNPs was 1 4 times  It seems that ACuNPs facilitate better specific targeting\n\nof CuNPs for tumor cells  resulting in less toxic effects on non-cancerous cells  The proposed\n\ndose of ACuNPs  70 μM  is not toxic to normal cells  Consequently  it seems that bonding to\nBSA has resulted in the specific uptake of the ACuNPs by cancer cells  This conclusion is in\n\nagreement compatible with what was reported by Furthermore  S  Honary and F  Zahir  33 \n\nThey reported that negatively charged nanoparticles have lower cytotoxicity compared to posi-\n\ntively charged particles  a statement that  This was also approved by FDA [33]  Therefore \n\nACuNPs have suitable charge that makes them excellent candidates to be used in chemotherapy \n\n3 3 1 Cytomorphological changes on MDA-MB 231 cells  ACuNPs treated cancer cells\n\nshowed several morphological transformations compared to untreated cells  Such transforma-\n\ntions were also seen in CuNPs treated cells  These included inhibition of cell growth  loss of\n\nmembrane integrity  cytoplasm condensation  creating apoptosis body  and curved forms  Fig\n\n5A–5C These changes induced apoptotic cell death in cancer cells  whereas the non-treated\n\ncells were alive \n\n3 3 2 Nuclear characteristic in MDA-MB 231  For further improvement of apoptotic cell\n\ndeath in CuNPs and ACuNPs treated cells  AO/EB double staining method was used  Fig 5D–\n\n5F  Apoptosis is distinguishable based on nuclear color changes  Orange particles were related\n\nto the apoptotic cells because of permeability for both AO and EB  while green particles were\n\nrelated to the viable cells due to impermeability toward EB  The treated cells  illustrated a large\n\nnumber of apoptotic cells compared to control cells \n\n3 3 3 DNA fragmentation  To distinguish between the apoptotic and necrotic cells  the\n\nbiochemical technique of DNA fragmentation analysis was conducted as a cellular marker for\n\napoptosis  This assay involves extraction of DNA from a lysed cell homogenate  followed by\n\nagarose gel electrophoresis  The DNA of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CuNPs and ACuNPs\n\nwere extracted and loaded on the 2% agarose gel  The results  Fig 5G  show that the pattern of\n\nDNA ladder is somehow related to the extracted chromatin from CuNPs and ACuNPs treated\n\ncancer cells \n\n3 3 4 Quantification of apoptosis  Quantification of apoptosis data were performed\n\nusing flow cytometry  Fig 6A–6C shows the ACuNPs and CuNPs induced apoptosis in\n\nMDA-MB 231cells after 24 h treatment at IC50 concentrations \n\n3 4  Effect of ACuNPs on cell cycle\nThe effect of ACuNPs on cell cycle progression in MDA-MB 231 cells was analyzed after expo-\n\nsure to ACuNPs at the concentration of IC50 for 24 h  Cells with damaged DNA will accumu-\n\nlate in gap1  G1  DNA synthesis  S  or in gap2/mitosis  G2/M  phase [34]  Cells with\n\nirreversible damage will undergo apoptosis  34  As shown in Fig 6D and 6E  24 h after\n\nACuNPs treatment at IC50 concentration  43% of the MDA-MB 231 cells were in G1 phase \n\n44% were in S phase  and 13% were in G2 phase compared to the untreated control cells  40%\n\nof the cells in G1 phase  36% in S phase  and 24% in G2 phase  DNA loss in apoptotic cells \n\ndue to cell permeation and fixation in ethanol before staining

cycle is the same in ACuNPs and CuNPs treated cells  Both of CuNPs and\n\nACuNPs at IC50 concentrations resulted in the increase of accumulation in G1 and S phases\n\nand decrease of G2 population  This phenomenon is probably due to the fact that the action\n\nmechanisms of CuNPs and ACuNPs inside the cells were similar  This is the same pattern of\n\nFig 5  Left  Inverted microscopic images of

of significant\n\namount of apoptotic cells and significant decline in G2/M phase [35] \n\n3 5  Intracellular ROS increasing during ACuNPs treatment\nIt has been reported that cytotoxicity of nano-leveled materials is related to intracellular ROS\n\nincrement [36]  ROS is involved in several biological functions of the cell in both normal or\n\nstress conditions  Under normal conditions  ROS triggers growth and development  however \n\nunder stressed conditions  ROS may lead to pathological effects  even cell death  Excessive\n\namounts of intracellular ROS lead to the apoptosis [37]  Additionally  it was shown that the\n\nmechanism of apoptosis induction under treatment with heavy metal nanoparticle may corre-\n\nlate with increased levels of ROS  This was confirmed where ACuNPs led to increase of the\n\nintracellular levels of ROS \n\nThe potential of ACuNPs to increase intracellular ROS level was evaluated using DCFHDA\n\nassay  Treated cells with 1mM of H2O2 were considered as positive controls to validate the test \n\nFig 6   A-C  Two-dimensional contour density plots of MDA-MB-231 cells obtained by flow cytometry based assays  A  Control  B and C  Treated

as expected  24 hours after the\n\nACuNPs treatment  the emission of the green fluorescent DCF dye was read at 525 nm  As\n\ndepicted in Fig 7  ACuNPs  like CuNPs led to increase of the oxidative stress in a dose-depen-\n\ndent pattern  It could be concluded that the mechanism of ACuNPs affection on treated cells is\n\nthrough increased ROS  A previous publication has also comprised that copper nanoparticles\n\ncould increase ROS levels in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells  35 \n\n3 6  Effect of ACuNPs on the body weight of mice and tumor size\nThe mice that were only treated with 4T1 cells could not gain enough weight in 14 days  All\n\ngroups that were treated with ACuNPs  included  groups 2  4 and 5  had higher weight than\n\nnon-receiving ones  Also  group 2  which was injected only with ACuNPs had the highest\n\nweight than other groups  These results indicated that ACuNPs have a positive effect on\n\ngrowth of BALB/c mice  Fig 8 \n\nA significant difference in the tumor size is depicted in Fig 8B  As predicted  groups 1 and 2\n\ndid not show any signs of tumor  The maximum tumor size was found in group 3  which was\n\ninjected by only 4T1 without any ACuNPs treatment  Comparison between groups 4 and 5\n\nrevealed that ACuNPs could prevent tumorigenesis  but the ACuNPs would be less effective\n\nfor preventing the tumorigenesis compared to effectiveness as inducers of apoptosis  Fig 8B\n\nFig 7  ROS increment in CuNPs ■ and ACuNPs □ treated MDA-MB-231 cells  Relative fluorescence emission of DCF was measured via\nfluorescence spectroscopy with excitation and

tumor-\n\nbearing mice \n\n4  Discussion\nAlbumin nanocarriers have attracted much attention in the field of targeted delivery of thera-\n\npeutic agents  This is primarily due to their high drug loading capacity  biodegradability \n\nbiocompatibility  and the possibility of carrying different types of hydrophobic and hydro-\n\nphilic drugs \n\nFurthermore  anti-breast cancer effects of CuNPs have been documented [35]  The pro-\n\nposed mechanism for this effect is the interaction of the CuNPs with the intracellular macro-\n\nmolecules like proteins and DNA  Cellular uptake of the CuNPs leads to increased ROS \n\nresulting in induction of apoptosis [38]  Therefore  ACuNPs were designed and developed for\n\ntargeted delivery of CuNPs to one of the most invasive breast cancer cell lines  namely MDA-\n\nMB-231 \n\nAt first  the blank nanoparticles of albumin were synthesized and named as ANPs  To\n\nunderstand the mechanism of ANP formation  we focused on the fact that ultrasonication pro-\n\ncess produces cavitation in the liquid that causes tremendous local heating and pressure which\n\ncan lead to the formation of superoxide ions  The thus produced superoxide ions attack BSA\n\nand disrupt the existing disulfide bonds between its cysteine residues and produce cysteinyl\n\nradicals  In this step  some of the cysteinyl radicals are inhibited by transforming

residues of each BSA  However  because of\n\ntheir instability  the cysteinyl radicals tend to attack each other and accumulate in the form\n\nof ANPs  The idea of ANPs formation comes from the proposal inspired from the patent\n\nregistered by Desai N P  et al  [39]  They proposed that the ANPs formation begins by\n\nreplacing the disulfide bonds within each BSA molecule with such bonds between them  By\n\nthe accumulation of at least 7 BSA molecules together via formation of new inter-molecular\n\ndisulfide bonds between cysteinyl radicals in the adjacent BSA molecules  they join to form\n\nANPs  Fig 9 \n\nFurthermore  based on the aforementioned mechanism  one may assume that in the pres-\n\nence of copper ions  formation of the thiol-copper-thiol bond between cysteine residues of sev-\n\neral BSA molecules is feasible  In our previous work reported by Dashtestani  F  et al [40]  we\n\nverified that cysteine could be co-ordinated to copper via its thiol functional group  Therefore \n\nFig 9  Proposed mechanism of ANPs and ACuNPs formations \n\nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188639 g009\n\nAlbumin-copper nanoparticle against breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https

layer around nanoparticles  the released citrate ions could then induce\n\nchanging in the copper oxidation degree from zero to double positive ions  Secondly  the pro-\n\nduction of superoxide ions as a result of ultrasonication process  led to the formation of cystei-\n\nnyl radicals  While  BSA is under ultrasonication in the presence of copper ions  cysteinyl\n\nradicals from adjacent BSA molecules bind each other via a copper bridge  thiol-copper-thiol \n\nto form ACuNPs  Fig 9 \n\nThe mechanism of the toxicity of CuNPs involves rupturing of the cellular membrane [41] \n\nBased on the fact that there is a higher O2 concentration in the cell membrane compared to the\n\ncell media  CuNPs are oxidized as they pass through the cell membrane  producing copper\n\nions  Therefore  the rupturing of the cellular may be a result of the metal release process into\n\nthe cell  leading to the production of H2O2 locally at the cell membrane [42]  It should be\n\nnoted that rupturing of the cellular membrane is not only due to the released copper ion into\n\nthe cell  but also due to the direct exposure of human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 to the\n\ncopper ions  leading to less toxic damage to the membrane [4  43]  It should be noted that cop-\n\nper ion release process from CuNPs into the vicinity of membrane surface is a critical stage in\n\nCuNPs toxicity  Other studies are based on carbon-coated CuNPs and CuCl2  Both of these\n\ncomponents did not cause membrane rupture whereas CuNPs induced rupturing of the cell\n\nmembrane [44]  It can be concluded that the ultimate fate of Cu-metal nanoparticles upon\n\nentering the body will be degrading and producing Cu2+ ions  Therefore  after having their\n\ncytotoxic effect on cancer cell and being released as ions  they will not be cytotoxic  because\n\nCu2+ ion is not cytotoxic in concentrations lower than 500 μM \nHerein  we developed a novel nanocomposite of CuNPs covered by albumin as a nanocar-\n\nrier and assayed its cytotoxic properties against invasive human cancer cell line of MDA-MB-\n\n231 for the first time  Our results showed that the delivery of copper nanoparticle with albumin\n\nnanocarrier  has an inhibitory effect on the viability of human breast cancer cell lines similar\n\nto the effect of naked copper nanoparticles  However  the IC50 value for ACuNPs was less than\n\nthat of CuNPs  This phenomenon is probably due to enhancement of the albumin internaliza-\n\ntion in cancer cells [45] and subsequent increase of the intracellular levels of CuNPs  A princi-\n\nple reason for applying a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent is the potential of this agent to\n\ninduce apoptosis and cell death in cancer cells [46]  since during apoptosis  the cells die with-\n\nout generating any inflammatory responses [47]  Statistics imply that breast cancer is faced\n\nwith uncontrolled growth and there is an urgent need to discover and develop a new antican-\n\ncer agent with fewer side effects for normal cells [48]  Thus  the potential of apoptosis induc-\n\ntion by ACuNPs against invasive breast cancer cell lines was assayed  The cytomorphological\n\nchanges under an inverted phase-contrast microscopy  acridine orange in combination with\n\nethidium bromide staining and DNA fragmentation assay after 24 hours were used  According\n\nto the data analysis  ACuNPs had the potential to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells  Treat-\n\ning cells with a variety of stress factors  such as anti-cancer drugs  lead to an increase in ROS\n\nlevels and the cellular apoptosis [49] by triggering pro-apoptotic signaling molecules [50]  It is\n\nassumed that oxidative stress causing factor can selectively lead to cancer cells death compared\n\nwith the normal cell  due to the production of higher concentration of ROS in cancer cells\n\n[48] \n\nFinally  in vivo data clearly emphasized that ACuNPs has a positive effect on growth of\n\nBALB/c mice  because All groups receiving ACuNPs  included  groups 2  4 and 5  had higher\n\nweight than non-receiving ones  Also  group 2 which was injected only by ACuNPs had the\n\nhighest weight among all  The weight gain phenomenon after treatment with nanoparticle has\n\nbeen reported in some reports especially in which they use protein nanoparticle  Kishore Golla\n\net al  also showed that when rats were treated by an anti-cancer drug  doxorubicin  loaded\n\nAlbumin-copper nanoparticle against breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0188639 November 29  2017 17 / 21\n\n\n\n\nprotein nanoparticle  apotransferrin and lactoferrin nanoparticles  a slight increase in body\n\nweight of was observed [51]  The probable reason for this phenomenon may be due to promot-\n\ning diet and enriching it by protein  ACuNPs effects on both prevention and treatment of\n\ntumor glands  although it had better effect on treatment and removing glands \n\n5  Conclusion\nA new nanocomposite of copper nanoparticle embedded in albumin nanocarrier was prepared\n\n ACuNPs  which had the spherical shape with the smooth border and an average diameter\n\nunder 100 nm  Structural studies revealed that during the process of ACuNPs synthesis  the\n\nstructure of BSA remained almost intact  Biochemical studies showed that ACuNPs induces\n\ncell death in human breast cancer cells  MDA-MB 231  however  the degree of induction was\n\ndose-dependent  It was verified that apoptosis is the route of cell death in the treatment of\n\nMDA-MB-231 by ACuNPs based on the evident of  i  cytomorphological changes under an\n\ninverted phase-contrast microscopy   ii  permeability of treated cell toward acridine orange\n\nand ethidium bromide   iii  creating ladder pattern in DNA gel electrophoresis and  iv  quan-\n\ntitative data of flow cytometry  ACuNPs was also found to induce oxidative stress which was\n\nevident by ROS generation  Cytotoxicity of ACuNPs against breast cancer cells was 5 7 times\n\nmore severe than that on normal cells  Over all  one may conclude that the ACuNPs nanocom-\n\nposite can be a good candidate to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast\n\ncancer cells  however  further pharmacological studies are needed \n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Eimear O’Reilly of

local\nanesthesia for an accurate diagnosis  Biopsy results indicated that\nthe mass was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  Fig  2 \nThe review of medical history found that the patient was\n\ndiagnosed with a 35mm intraductal carcinoma in the left breast\nin 2009 and treated with radical mastectomy and axillary node\nclearance  Eleven axillary lymph nodes were removed  and none\nof them was positive for breast carcinoma  The carcinoma was\nclassiﬁed as histological grade 3 and staged as pT2N0M0\naccording to the Tumor  nodes and metastasis staing system \nFurther analysis revealed the cancer specimen was negative for\nestrogen receptor  ER  progesterone receptor  PR  and human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER-2  indicating that the\n\nancy was triple-negative

non-metastatic breast cancer  Osteoporosis is interpreted both as a direct marker of\nosteoblastic decline and as an indirect marker of increased bone marrow adiposity within the hematopoietic microenvironment \nPatients from the BCentre du Sein^ at CHUV  Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois  undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were\nincluded in this study  Evolution of blood counts was

subtypes  MR images of 100\npatients with BM from primary breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed  Patients were\ndivided according to the biological subtype of the primary tumor   triple-negative  24  HER2\npositive  48  luminal  28  All images marked with BMs were standardized to the human\nbrain MRI atlas provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 database  Distribution\npattern of BM was evaluated with intra-group and intergroup analysis  In intra-group analy-\nsis  hot spots of metastases from triple-negative are evenly distributed in the brain  mean-\nwhile BMs from HER2 positive and luminal type occur dominantly in occipital lobe and\ncerebellum  In intergroup analysis  BMs from triple-negative type occurred more often in\nfrontal lobe  limbic region  and parietal lobe  compared with other types  P <  05  Breast\ncancer subtypes tend to demonstrate different spatial distributions of their BMs  These find-\nings may have direct implications for dose modulation in prophylactic irradiation as well as\nfor differential diagnoses  Thus  this result should be validated in future study with a larger\npopulation \n\nIntroduction\nBrain metastases  BMs  are the most commonly encountered malignant tumors occurring in\n\nthe CNS  outnumbering primary CNS tumors by more than 10-fold[1]  Breast cancer is the\n\nsecond most frequent cause of BM after lung cancer  with metastases occurring in 10–16% of\n\npatients[2]  Median survival ranges from 3 to 15 months following metastatic spread to the\n\nbrain  making BMs one of the major causes of systemic cancer-related mortality[3]  Recently \n\nthe incidence of BMs has increased because of improvements in treatment for primary cancers\n\nand more advanced imaging techniques[4 5] \n\nBreast cancer can be divided into several biologic subtypes on the basis of their clinical  his-\n\ntopathological  and molecular features  Further  breast cancer can be classified on the basis of\n\nPLOS ONE | https

HER2-positive  with each subtype show-\n\ning a clearly different prognostic significance[6 7]  The subgroups of patients with triple-nega-\n\ntive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER2 -positive breast cancer are at a\n\nhigher risk for development of BMs[8–10]  The onset of BMs in triple receptor-negative breast\n\ncancer is earlier than that observed in other subtypes  and the overall survival rate is particu-\n\nlarly poor  when compared to other subtypes[11] \n\nTreatment options for patients with breast cancer BMs are limited and include surgical\n\nresection  whole-brain radiation therapy  stereotactic radiosurgery  chemotherapy  and tar-\n\ngeted therapy[12–14]  Prophylactic cranial irradiation improves the survival rate of patients\n\nwith lung cancer BMs[15 16]  and may represent a novel approach for select patients with\n\nbreast cancer BMs[17]  Thus  understanding the spatial distributions of BMs by breast cancer\n\nsubtype may allow for more precise prophylactic irradiation adjustments and could lead to the\n\ndevelopment of novel targeted therapy \n\nBiological characteristics of tumors could affect the spatial distribution of their BMs  For\n\nexample  the probability of cerebellar metastases is higher in lung and breast cancer[18]  BMs\n\nare typically located in watershed areas such as the gray-white matter junction[19]  Recently \n\nTakano et al  reported that lung cancer BMs with an epidermal growth factor receptor  EGFR \n\nL858R mutation occurred more often in the caudate nucleus  cerebellum  and temporal lobe\n\nthan those with an EGFR exon 19 deletion[20]  We hypothesized that breast cancer BMs have\n\ndifferent spatial distributions according to their biological subtypes \n\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nWe retrospectively reviewed data for breast cancer patients with BM who underwent gado-\n\nlinium-enhanced brain MRI from 2009 to 2016  A total of 128 patients were identified  Of\n\ntheses 27 patients were excluded for the following reasons  Fig 1   1  previous neurosurgery\n\nor brain radiation therapy  n = 10   2  presence of other malignant disease  n = 5  and\n\n 3  absence of the immunohistochemistry profile of breast cancer  n = 12  A total of 101\n\npatients was remained after selection criteria  However  an unknown error occurred during\n\nexporting from the hospital database to the local computer in one of 101 brain MRIs  and\n\nthis case was removed in the statistical mapping  Finally  gadolinium-enhanced 3D T1WIs\n\nof 100 breast cancer patients in whom BMs were initially diagnosed were included in this\n\nanalysis  slice thickness <1 5 mm on 3 0T MRI  Patients were divided into three groups\n\naccording to biological subtypes on the basis of the expression of estrogen  ER  progester-\n\none  PgR  and HER2  Immunohistochemistry was carried out for the evaluation of the\n\nlevel of ER  PgR  and HER2 expression of primary breast cancer  Florescence in-situ hybrid-\n\nization analysis of HER2 amplification was carried out in immunohistochemistry 2+ cases \n\nThe three subtypes were triple negative  ER-  PgR-  HER2-  HER2 positive  HER2 +  any\n\nER/PgR  and luminal  ER/PgR +  HER2 -  The current study design and use of clinical\n\ndata was approved by the institutional review board of Gangnam Severance hospital

normalized lesion maps were extended to a\n\nsite-centered spherical shape with a radius of 15 mm  Fig 1B  Subsequently  these spherical\n\nBMs were matched with the AAL template  Initially  we assigned zeros for 116 cortical  subcor-\n\ntical  and cerebellar regions in AAL template space  we then assigned ones if there were over-\n\nlaps between individual spherical BMs and AAL regions

observation is important because prophylactic irradiation with dose\n\nmodulation to the preferential site is a viable approach for breast cancer to enhance its preven-\n\ntive effect and reduce any side effects \n\nSeveral studies have found that the cerebellum was the predominant site of metastases in\n\nbreast cancer patients [22–24] Our data also confirm that the cerebellum is the preferential site\n\nof breast cancer BMs  Conventionally  the “seed and soil theory” has been used to explain the\n\npreferential involvement of specific areas within the brain  the site of metastasis depends on the\n\naffinity of the tumor  the “seed”  to the microenvironment  the “soil” [25]  Other potential\n\nexplanations for preferential involvement of the cerebellum are as follows   1  high gyral density\n\nFig 2  Heat maps of brain metastases  BMs  Overlapping of BMs across all patients with breast cancer  A  patients with triple negative type  B \npatients with HER2+ type  C

tissue per minute in posterior circulation territories[26 27] \n\n 3  different regional vasomotor response in the cerebellar circulation oriented toward a greater\n\nvessel dilatation[28 29] \n\nHowever  recent studies have revealed the molecular mechanism of the spatial distribution\n\nof BMs  In breast cancer  chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 and CCR7 play a critical role in\n\ndetermining the metastatic destination of tumor cells[30]  COX2  EGFR ligand  and ST6GAL-\n\nNAC5 cross over the blood-brain barrier and enhance breast cancer metastasis to the brain \n\nEvidence of specific subtypes showing a preference for brain metastasis is overwhelming  Tri-\n\nple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer predispose to a higher risk of BM than that\n\nobserved in luminal breast cancer  with an incidence of 30–40%[31–33]  A previous study\n\nreported that triple-negative type and HER2-positive breast cancer show an earlier onset of\n\nBMs than luminal breast cancer  which is consistent with our study[11 34]  In a recent study \n\nWNT signaling was up-regulated in the triple-negative subtype and the BMs  but down-regu-\n\nlated in the luminal subtype and bone metastases[35]  Thus  we can assume that the spatial dis-\n\ntribution of BMs differ according to the genetic composition of the primary breast cancer \n\nInterestingly  our study showed that BMs of tripe-negative spread evenly in the whole brain \n\nhowever HER-2 positive and luminal types have preferential involvements in the posterior cir-\n\nculation territories such as occipital lobe and cerebellum \n\nDespite neurosurgery and radiosurgery  triple-negative type breast cancer patients have the\n\nworst prognosis  with an overall survival duration of only 4 9 months [36] Prophylactic cranial\n\nirradiation is a suitable treatment option for high-risk breast cancer  A randomized controlled\n\ntrial showed that among 62 high-risk breast cancer patients receiving prophylactic cranial irra-\n\ndiation with 24 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks  none developed BMs  but 6 4% of patients in\n\nthe no prophylactic cranial irradiation arm developed BMs [37] Thus  our results suggest dif-\n\nferent strategies of dose modulation of radiotherapy  whole brain coverage for triple-negative\n\nvs posterior circulation territories for HER2+ and luminal type \n\nOur results also may increase the diagnostic yield of brain metastases  Clinical information\n\nof triple-negative type of primary breast cancer could make radiologist to review  with a metic-\n\nulous effort  occipital lobe and cerebellum as well as frontal  limbic and parietal lobe \n\nThis study has a limitation  The number of cases was not enough to draw a solid conclusion \n\nHowever  our results may serve as a cornerstone for future studies with a larger population to\n\nvalidate and extend these results \n\nIn conclusion  different breast cancer subtypes may show different spatial distributions of\n\nBMs  Triple-negative breast cancer BMs has a tendency to spread evenly in the whole brain \n\nmeanwhile HER2+ and luminal types have a preponderance for posterior circulation territo-\n\nries  These results suggest different strategies for prophylactic irradiation according to sub-\n\ntypes  triple-negative vs other types \n\nSupporting information\nS1 File

of the tumor [6–8] The prognostic value of 18F FDG\ny the primary tumor inpatientswith invasive ductal breast\nDC  has been investigated in previous studies [9–14] It is\nrom these studies that there exists a relationship between\nscan derived metabolic parameters  such as the maximum\nized uptake value  SUVmax  metabolic tumor volume\nnd total lesion glycolysis  TLG  of primary tumors  and\nrognostic parameters of breast cancer  These metabolic\ners can therefore serve as good surrogate markers for the\nn of disease progression in patients with IDC [9–14]\n\nis increasing recognition that the heterogeneity of\npeutic 18F FDG uptake in the primary tumor can provide\ne information in several solid tumors  Therefore \ning the heterogeneity of 18F FDG uptake appears

in young women are generally aggressive  young patients tend to be\nintensively treated with anti-cancer drugs  To optimize the strategy for treatment  particularly\nin young women  prognostic biomarkers are urgently required  The objective of this study\nwas to identify a tissue microRNA  miRNA  signature that predicts prognosis in young breast\ncancer patients  Total RNA from 45 breast cancer patients aged  0 7  Five of the miR-\nNAs were validated by qRT-PCR  and the expression levels of three of those five  miR-183-\n5p  miR-194-5p  and miR-1285-5p  both alone and in combination  were associated with\nOS  In conclusion  we identified three candidate miRNAs that could be used separately or in\ncombination as prognostic biomarkers in young breast cancer patients  This miRNA signa-\nture may enable selection of better treatment choices for young women with this disease \n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0187638 November 15  2017 1 /

Previously  however  Huo et al  reported high\n\nexpression of miR-194-5p as a circulating miRNA signature in blood associated with recur-\n\nrence [23] \n\nTo our knowledge  the role of miR-1285-5p in breast cancer has not been previously\n\nreported  although a few studies have mentioned miR-1285-3p in the context of renal cell and\n\nhepatocellular carcinoma [44]  Here  we observed aberrant expression of miR-1285-5p in\n\nbreast cancer with recurrence  particularly in young women  The biological function and\n\npotential molecular mechanisms of these miRNAs need to be elucidated  Also  future studies\n\nshould validate the prognostic values of the expression levels of these miRNAs \n\nAlthough we did not detect an association of miR-205-5p or miR-375 with clinical out-\n\ncome  these miRNAs have been implicated in breast cancer  Expression of miR-205-5p is sig-\n\nnificantly reduced in tumor tissues in comparison with neighboring normal tissues  as\n\ndocumented by other groups [25–27  45]  In breast tissues  miR-205-5p is expressed at high\n\nlevels in myoepithelial and basal epithelial cells in normal breast [45]  and retention of miR-\n\n205-5p expression in cancer cells is associated with better clinical outcomes [27  28]  On the\n\nother hand  miR-375 is up-regulated in ER-positive cell lines and plays a role in regulating ER\n\n[46]  Low expression of miR-375 was proposed as a predictor of relapse by Hoppe et al  who\n\nexamined the associations between differentially expressed miRNAs  ER status  and tamoxifen\n\nresistance in postmenopausal women [30]  By contrast  Zehentmary reported high expression\n\nof miR-375 as a predictor of local recurrence of early breast cancer [29]  Additionally  miR-375\n\nmodulates sensitivity to tamoxifen [47] and trastuzumab [48] in breast cancer cells  Taking\n\nTable 4  Cox regression hazard analysis for overall survival \n\nUnivariate analysis Multivariate analysis†\n\nHR  95% CI  p value HR  95% CI  p

not large because young women aged <35 years with\n\nbreast cancer are rare  accounting for only 2 7% of all breast cancers in Japan  and most of\n\nthese patients receive neoadjuvant therapies [4]  Especially  the sample size of the patients with\n\na poor prognosis  such as those that were HER2-enriched and triple negative  was small \n\nTherefore  the statistical significance for the association between the identified miRNAs and\n\npoor prognostic subtypes was insufficient  3  We could not compare expression levels between\n\npaired cancer and normal tissues  Consideration of these points is essential for identifying the\n\nideal biomarkers for diagnosis of breast cancer for use in early detection  However  the main\n\ngoal of this study was identification of prognostic biomarkers  as well as biomarkers for the\n\noptimal treatment choices  in young women who were already diagnosed with breast cancer \n\nIn other words  although some concerns exist regarding sample collection  by choosing a\n\nresearch cohort with the same treatment background and simply comparing recurrence status \n\nwe identified candidate prognostic biomarkers for young breast cancer patients \n\nThe distinct expression profiles of miRNAs in cancer  especially those that differ according\n\nto tumor status  have received a great deal of attention as both prognostic and diagnostic bio-\n\nmarkers  To discover prognostic markers for early recurrence in young women  we performed\n\ncomprehensive miRNA microarray analysis of FFPE samples from young breast cancer\n\npatients by comparing recurrence and non-recurrence status  These results demonstrated that\n\nthree miRNAs  miR-183-5p  miR-194-5p  and miR-1285-5p  used in combination  could be\n\nused to accurately predict early recurrence  Because anti-cancer drugs for young women must\n\nbe selected carefully  judgments based on the miRNA signature may provide better treatment\n\nchoices for these patients  In summary  our data provide insight into the potential use of\n\nmiRNA expression profiles for predicting prognosis in young breast cancer patients \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig  Kaplan–Meier plots of

dishes  which are flat  2-dimensional  2D  and orders of magnitude stiffer than most\ntissues in the body  Such simplified conditions lead to phenotypical cell changes and altered\ncell behaviors  Hence  much research has been focused on developing novel biomaterials\nand culture conditions that more closely emulate in vivo cell microenvironments  In particu-\nlar  biomaterial stiffness has emerged as a key property that greatly affects cell behaviors\nsuch as adhesion  morphology  proliferation and motility among others  Here we ask\nwhether cells that have been conditioned to TCP  would still show significant dependence\non substrate stiffness if they are first pre-adapted to a more physiologically relevant environ-\nment  We used two commonly utilized breast cancer cell lines  namely MDA-MB-231 and\nMCF-7  and examined the effect of prolonged cell culturing on polyacrylamide substrates of\nvarying compliance  We followed changes in cell adhesion  proliferation  shape factor \nspreading area and spreading rate  After pre-adaptation  we noted diminished differences\nin cell behaviors when comparing between soft  1 kPa  and stiff  103 kPa  gels as well as\nrigid TCP control  Prolonged culturing of cells on complaint substrates further influenced\nresponses of pre-adapted cells when transferred back to TCP  Our results have implications\nfor the study of stiffness-dependent cell behaviors and indicate that cell pre-adaptation to\nthe substrate needs consideration \n\nIntroduction\nStandard tissue culture practices  which involve propagating cells in

employed for over\n\na decade [2]  While extremely useful due to their affordability  convenience  biocompatibility \n\nand robustness [3–5]  mounting research evidence suggests that the simplified conditions\n\ncould also lead to very different cell responses compared to the in vivo cell environment [6] \n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0187853 November 14  2017 1 /

authors have declared\n\nthat no competing interests exist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomaterials capable of emulating one or several aspects of cell microenvironments are  thus \n\ngaining importance as bridges between standard tissue culture and in vivo conditions [7]  Con-\nsequently  a question that has emerged is how long does it take for cells  and in particular cell\n\nlines propagated on TCP surfaces  to adapt to their new biomaterial environment and what\n\nwould the implications of such an adaptation be \n\nTo begin answering this question  here we focus on substrate stiffness  which is one of sev-\n\neral major biomaterial properties that significantly affect cell behaviors  Importantly  substrate\n\nstiffness can be controlled readily and reproducibly [8–10] and cell responses to substrate stiff-\n\nness have been well-documented [11  12]  For example  substrate stiffness has been shown to\n\naffect cell viability  growth  and proliferation [13]  cell morphology  cytoskeletal structure and\n\nadhesion [14]  stem cell differentiation [15]  cell migration [16  17] and drug responsiveness\n\n[18  19] among other properties  Interestingly  for much of the work related to stiffness-depen-\n\ndent cell responses  cells have been continuously passaged on TCP  then seeded onto selected\n\ncompliant substrates and tested for cell responses without pre-adapting the cells to their new\n\nmicroenvironment beyond several hours [20  21] \n\nIn this work  we hypothesized that  i  cell behaviors would change as a function of a pro-\nlonged pre-adaptation to a compliant substrate  and ii  upon adaptation  the differences in cer-\ntain cell behaviors on soft versus stiff substrates will be minimized  Our hypothesis is based on\nthe premise that most cells  and in particular cell lines  have adapted to stiff environment dur-\n\ning continuous passaging on TCP  regardless of the stiffness of their tissue of origin  The effect\n\nof continuous cell passaging on stiff TCP on cell properties has been widely studied over the\n\npast decade [22]  For example  after primary porcine coronary arterial endothelial cells were\n\npassaged in vitro on TCP for multiple passages  they exhibited reduced proliferative capacity \nincreased oxidation  enhanced apoptosis  and even activation of p53 signaling pathways  which\n\nis a pathway that plays a significant role in tumor metastasis [22  23]  Another study examined\n\nlong-term effects of in vitro passaging of primate brain micro-vessel endothelial cells  showing\nthat it caused changes in enzyme activities and in the total protein content [24]  Further  a\n\nstudy conducted on human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed alterations in expression of\n\nactin and cytoskeletal proteins  as well as changes in cell spreading  migration  and shape after\n\nserial passaging of cells in vitro on TCP [25]  Although studies have looked into the effects of\nprolonged passaging on TCP  the effect of prolonged cell passaging on biomaterials  specifically\n\nfor cell lines that have been conditioned to TCP  has generally been overlooked \n\nTo address this gap  we cultured two breast cancer cell lines on polyacrylamide  PA  hydro-\n\ngels of varying stiffness  1–103 kPa  TCP was used as control  for 9 consecutive days or 3 pas-\n\nsages  We then studied cell morphology  adhesion  proliferation and spreading rate as a\n\nfunction of cell adaptation to the stiffness of the underlying substrate  We observed significant\n\nadaptation upon prolonged passaging  which resulted in diminished differences in cell behav-\n\niors on soft versus stiff substrates  Cells exhibited increased adhesion  proliferation and spread-\ning at day 9 as compared to day 1 of a prolonged culture on soft PA gels  Our results have\n\nconsiderable implications for future studies on stiffness-dependent cell responses and under-\n\nscore the need for cell

supraphysiologic\n\nstiffness  the Young’s modulus of a standard tissue culture dish is ~3 GPa [29]  The question\n\nthen becomes  should cells be re-conditioned to compliant substrates prior to detailed studies\n\non stiffness-related cell behaviors  In this work  we hypothesized that  i  cell behaviors would\nchange as a function of a prolonged pre-adaptation to a compliant substrate  and ii  upon\nadaptation the differences in certain cell behaviors on soft versus stiff substrates will be mini-\nmized  We specifically focused on cell adhesion  proliferation  morphology  and

kPa  stiff  in Young’s\n\nmodulus and two breast cancer cell lines  namely MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7  Both cell lines\n\nare routinely used in basic cancer research [28] and are part of the NCI-60 cell line panel on\n\nwhich all new anti-cancer drugs are tested [30]  Because their tissue of origin is the mammary\n\ngland  which has a stiffness of ~0 1–1 kPa  our soft gel was chosen to emulate the native tissue\n\nstiffness and the stiff gel was closer in mechanical properties to the cancerous breast stroma \n\nwhich could be multiple-times stiffer than normal breast stroma [31]  TCP was used as a con-\n\ntrol in all experiments \n\nWhile studies on cell adaptation to the rigidity of the substrate have been conducted previ-\n\nously  such studies have not taken into account prolonged adaptation time  For example  it has\n\nbeen shown that fibroblast cells adapt to substrate stiffness by increasing their own modulus \n\nre-organizing their actin cytoskeleton and exerting higher traction forces after only hours of\n\nincubation [21]  In fact  fibroblasts alter their modulus to match that of the substrate up to a\n\nthreshold of 20 kPa modulus  thus  spanning the range of soft tissue stiffness [20]  However  a\n\nrecent study of normal versus cancer thyroid cells on PA gels of varying stiffness  3–40 kPa \ndemonstrated that only normal cells changed their elastic modulus and dynamic viscosity pro-\n\nportionally to substrate stiffness  but cancer cells showed no such dependence [32]  hence \n\nsuch adaptations appear to be cell-specific  In general  the current paradigm is that traction\n\nforces exerted by cells arise at localized focal adhesions  whose size correlates to the force\n\nexerted by cells on the underlying substrate [33]  Focal adhesion proteins include focal adhe-\n\nsion kinase  FAK  Src family kinases  paxillin  α-actinin  vinculin and talin  which mostly\nbind to the actin cytoskeleton [34]  Such mechanosensing leads to a myriad of phenotypical\n\ncell changes  including in adhesion  proliferation  morphology and spreading rate [34] \n\nHere  we tested MDA-MB-231 cells on PA hydrogels in a range of stiffness from 0 5 to 103\n\nkPa in Young’s modulus and noted stiffness-dependent cell spreading and elongation  Fig 1 \n\nSpecifically  corroborating earlier studies [11  15  18]  we noted significant differences between\n\ncells on the 1 kPa versus the 103 kPa gel in terms of cell spreading and cell shape  hence  we\ndetermined that these two gels will allow us to follow adaptations in cell morphology as a func-\n\ntion of time  Note that we tested MDA-MB-231 cells on both 0 5 kPa and 1 kPa PA gels  but\n\nfound no significant difference in cell morphology  thus  we chose to work with the easier-to-\n\nhandle 1 kPa gel  We chose to focus on cell proliferation  adhesion  spreading  spreading rate\n\nand shape  since those properties have been well-documented to be dependent on substrate\n\nstiffness [14]  Lastly  we conditioned the cells to the substrate for 9 days  where cells were either\n\npassaged every 3rd day for a total of 3 passages or cultured continuously for 9 days to avoid the\n\nstress of re-passaging  We chose the 9 day period since we noticed significant changes in cell\n\nbehaviors at passage 3 or at approximately 6–7 days of continuous culturing on the hydrogel\n\nsubstrates  We chose to include cell re-passaging in addition to continuous passaging for two\n\nmain reasons  First  cells secrete ECM proteins  thus actively remodeling the underlying sub-\n\nstrate over time  Second  cell morphology is regulated by cell-cell interactions in dense cultures\n\nin addition to substrate stiffness [35]  hence  we focused on sub-confluent cell layers to decou-\n\nple the effect of substrate stiffness from cell density \n\nFirst  we quantified cell attachment and proliferation as a function of prolonged condition-\n\ning to the hydrogel substrates  Fig 2  When cells bind to an extracellular substrate  they recruit\n\nvarious structural and signaling proteins to form focal adhesions  which require mechanical\n\nforces to form and mature [36]  Cells on stiff substrates  such as TCP  are able to generate\n\nlarger forces leading to the formation of mature focal adhesions faster  whereas the same cells\n\non soft substrates cannot provide enough resistance to counter the cell-generated forces [36] \n\nleading to less initial attachment of cells on soft substrates  Corroborating such findings  we\n\nalso noted significantly decreased cell attachment on the 1 kPa gels as opposed to the 103 kPa\n\nMorphological adaptations of cells on compliant substrates\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone

different stiffness  We used the crosslinker\n\nsulfo-SANPAH to covalently crosslink collagen to the hydrogels and increase the overall coat-\n\ning efficiency  It has been previously shown by us and others that our method results in even\n\ncollagen coating for all PA gels and that collagen density is the same for hydrogels of varying\n\nstiffness [8  18]  Within each hydrogel type and TCP control  we didn’t note significant\n\nchanges in cell attachment efficiency as a function of conditioning to the substrate \n\nMore pronounced differences as a function of conditioning were seen when assessing cell\n\nproliferation  Fig 2B  Significantly more cell proliferation was seen both on 103 kPa and 1 kPa\n\ngels at P3 compared to P1  However  cell proliferation was still lower on the 1 kPa gel com-\n\npared to the 103 kPa gel even after conditioning and cell proliferation was lower on the gels\n\ncompared to the TCP control  Mechanical signaling through the cytoskeleton  which in turn is\n\ndependent on substrate stiffness  has been shown to regulate cell proliferation for a variety of\n\ncell types [37–39]  For the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in particular  increased\n\nproliferation has been noted for matrices of rigidities corresponding to the native tissue rigidi-\n\nties  where the differential rigidity response was related to Fyn kinase signaling [40]  Increased\n\nproliferation at 6 days of culture on stiff substrates for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells has also\n\nbeen linked to more stable focal adhesions and nuclear factor kappa-B  NF-κB  activation\n[41]  NF-κB is involved in tumor development including cell proliferation and apoptosis [42]\nand is regulated by actomyosin contractility [43] as well as by cell shape and the microenviron-\n\nment stiffness in breast epithelial and tumor cells [44]  In a separate study of MCF-7 and T47D\n\nbreast cancer cells on collagen I-coated PA gels of varying stiffness  the authors linked\n\nincreased proliferation on stiff substrates to prolactin signaling [45]  Specifically  it was con-\n\ncluded that substrate stiffness shifts the balance of prolactin signaling  implicated in metastatic\n\nprogression  from physiological to pathological by increasing prolactin signals through focal\n\nadhesions [45]  Finally  for breast cancer cells increased proliferation with increased substrate\n\nstiffness has been linked to increased invasiveness via various proliferative/invasive pathways \nsuch as Rac1 and PI3K [46  47] \n\nImportantly  when the conditioned cells were harvested from the hydrogels and seeded on\n\nTCP  the cells harvested from the 1 kPa gel showed lower cell proliferation compared to cells\n\nharvested from the 103 kPa gels  Fig 3  indicating that cell adaptation was not transient  hence\n\nthe cells exhibited ‘mechanical memory’  Such mechanical memory has recently been shown\n\nfor lung myoblasts when seeded on polydimethyl siloxane  PDMS  substrates of 5–100 kPa \n\nresembling the stiffness of normal to fibrotic lung tissue [48]  Specifically  when lung fibro-\n\nblasts were primed on pathologically stiff substrates by continuous re-passaging for 3 weeks \n\nthe cells showed sustained myofibroblast activity  hallmark for fibrosis  even when returned\n\nto soft cultures for 2 weeks [48]  In another study  the concept of mechanical memory was\n\ntested by mechanically ‘dosing’ human mesenchymal stem cells  hMSCs  to influence their\n\nfate [49]  The authors used soft  2 kPa  and stiff  10 kPa  polyethylene glycol  PEG  hydrogels\n\nas well as supraphysiologic TCP to show that prolonged mechanical dosing—above a threshold\n\nperiod of 10 days  irreversibly biased the stem cells towards osteogenic differentiation [49] \n\nThese examples corroborate our findings that cells are able to not only integrate  but store sig-\n\nnals from the ECM and also show that an irreversible cell response to substrate stiffness can\n\noccur only after prolonged passaging  Very little is known about the underlying mechanisms\n\nfor such mechanical memory  For example  for myofibroblasts it appears that α-smooth mus-\ncle actin  α-SMA  is required  where diminished expression of α-SMA converts myofibroblasts\nback to MSC-like cells [50]  Another proposed mechanism for MSCs’ mechanical memory is\n\nstable chromatin condensation upon dynamic tensile loading  resulting in stiffened nucleus \n\nwhich persists upon loading cessation [51] \n\nMorphological adaptations of cells on compliant substrates\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0187853 November 14  2017 19 / 26\n\n\n\n\nCell morphology is also highly dependent on the underlying substrate stiffness and previous\n\nstudies have shown that certain cell lines  including MDA-MB-231  exhibit a more elongated\n\nmorphology on stiff substrates than on soft ones  which has been related to their ability to gen-\n\nerate more traction forces [8  14  19]  However  previous studies have mostly shown cell mor-\n\nphology on gels at 1 min to 48 h upon seeding  which might not give cells adequate time to\n\nadapt [22  52  53]  In this study  we demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 cells were able to adapt\n\nto soft gels upon conditioning and displayed higher spreading and more elongated morpholo-\n\ngies at P3 as compared to P1  Figs 4 and 5  At P3 there was no significant difference in cell\n\nspreading area or cell shape between the 1 and 103 kPa gels  while the differences at P1 were\n\nsignificant  The differences were more pronounced on the soft 1 kPa than the stiff 103 kPa\n\ngels  Similar results were observed when MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured con-\n\ntinuously on a 1 kPa gel  TCP used as control  for 9 days  Figs 7 and 10  By day 6  cells on the\n\nsoft gels started elongating and spreading  resembling the morphology of cells cultured on\n\nTCP  Our results indicate that cells were able to adapt to the soft substrates upon prolonged\n\npassaging  Interestingly  cells also seemed to “remember” the stiffness to which they have been\n\npre-conditioned  When MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested from 1 and 103 kPa gels at P3 and\n\nseeded onto TCP  they exhibited lower spreading than cells that have been cultured on TCP\n\nonly  Fig 6 \n\nLastly  we showed that MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells had initially a lower spreading\n\nrate on soft 1 kPa gels compared to stiff 103 kPa gels of TCP  Rapid growth and spreading of\n\ncells on stiff substrates and TCP surfaces has been shown by others previously [14  54]  For\n\nexample  Yeung et al  [14] demonstrated that cells exhibited a 5-times larger spreading rate\non stiff 55 kPa gels compared to soft 0 18 kPa gels  Cell adhesion and spreading is mediated\n\nby receptor-ligand interactions and has been directly related to traction forces exerted by\n\ncells on the substrate  It has been shown that cells exert significant traction forces before\n\nfocal adhesion or fiber stress formation  whose magnitude is linearly related to the cell area\n\nduring spreading [55]  However  while cell area and force increase simultaneously during\n\nspreading  recent research has shown a delay in cell force development related to spreading\n\narea  reflective of the strain-stiffening property of the cytoskeleton [56]  Interestingly  a\n\nrecent detailed study showed that NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell spreading correlated with sub-\n\nstrate stiffness on PA gels  but not on PDMS gels of corresponding modulus  3–1000 kPa \n\n[57]  The difference was explained by the nature of the gels—PA gels are elastic  while PDMS\n\ngels behave like viscoelastic solids [57]  A separate study of A549 lung cancer cells on PA and\n\nPDMS gels of corresponding bulk stiffness  0 1–40 kPa  also showed that cell spreading rate\n\ncorrelated positively with PA gel stiffness  but was unaffected by PDMS bulk stiffness [58] \n\nThe difference in cell spreading was explained by the different interfacial stiffness of the two\n\nmaterials  where interfacial stiffness was found to play a more prominent role compared to\n\nbulk material stiffness [58] \n\nWe then again tested the concept of mechanical memory of the breast cancer cells by evalu-\n\nating the cell spreading rate pre- and post-conditioning of the cells on substrates of varying\n\nstiffness  Specifically  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells that have been conditioned to soft sub-\n\nstrates  1 and 103 kPa gels  for 9 days and then seeded onto the same substrate  had a higher\n\nspreading rate than cells that were transferred from TCP directly onto the gels  Figs 8  9  and\n\n11  Importantly  for the short observation times of 5 h  we did not see much signs of spreading\n\nfor the non-conditioned cells on the soft 1 kPa gels  but we observed spreading at 2 h upon\n\nconditioning  Note that cells  especially MCF-7 cells  on the 1 kPa gels seemed to stay in clus-\n\nters prior to adhesion and spreading  which could be due to strong cell-cell interactions and\n\nweak cell-matrix interactions [35] \n\nMorphological adaptations of cells on compliant substrates\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0187853 November 14  2017 20 / 26\n\n\n\n\nA prior study has shown that rigidity-dependent cancer cell lines  such as MDA-MB-231 \n\ngrowing on soft substrates for 24 h showed reduced spreading and migration  rounded mor-\n\nphologies  and were metabolically less active  indicative of properties of dormant cancer cells\n\n[8]  Cancer cells are known to enter a stage of dormancy when introduced to a foreign micro-\n\nenvironment  which has been shown to occur at sites of distant metastases in vivo [8  59] \nSimilarly  we suggest that when harvesting cells from TCP and seeding them on soft sub-\n\nstrates  the cells would enter a state of dormancy  only prolonged passaging would allow cells\n\nto adapt to the new environment  Here  we demonstrate that upon adaptation  certain pheno-\n\ntypical differences between cells on soft and stiff substrates diminish or disappear  Impor-\n\ntantly  cells remember the mechanical properties of the substrate they were conditioned to \n\neven when subsequently seeded on a substrate of different stiffness  As discussed above  such\n\nmechanical memory has been noted previously in lung myofibroblasts and MSCs and has\n\nbeen linked to permanent bias towards fibrotic behavior and osteogenic differentiation \n\nrespectively [29  48] \n\nWe focused our adaptation studies on PA hydrogels as they are extensively used to conduct\n\nstiffness-dependent cell research [8] and we used breast cancer cells lines  Also  we used colla-\n\ngen Type I as a default coating  since collagen Type I is the most abundant ECM protein found\n\nin the human body  [60] to elicit cell attachment  but other ECM proteins such as fibronectin\n\n[14  35] could be used as per the intended application  However  we believe that cell pre-adap-\n\ntation would be important for other substrates  coatings  or cell types  but that the degree of\n\nand time for adaptation will be dependent on the substrate-cell combination used  While not\n\nspecific to cell adaptation  others have shown that different cell types respond differently to\n\nsubstrate stiffness [18] or substrate coating  i e  biochemical signals  [61]  Hence  it is reason-\n\nable to expect that similar specificity would be applicable to cell adaptation  Thus  it would be\n\nour recommendation to establish an appropriate adaptation period for cells when seeded on a\n\nbiomaterial substrate  in particular cells that have been maintained on a TCP  prior to assessing\n\nsubstrate-dependent cell behaviors \n\nNote that some cell types might not require adaptation to the compliance of the substrate \n\nFor example  certain cell types such as human embryonic kidney cells HEK239  mouse fibro-\n\nblast cells L929 [62]  PC-3 prostate cancer cells [8]  or SW620 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells\n\n[18] do not show appreciable proliferative or morphological changes in response to substrate\n\nstiffness  Also  further work would be needed to establish what other cell adaptations occur\n\nupon prolonged passaging on substrates of varying stiffness  There might be adaptation-\n\ninduced changes in gene expression  cytoskeletal arrangement  motility or drug responses \n\nwhere changes in response to stiffness have already been documented [11  14  19  63]  The\n\nimplications of our work and any further findings on cell adaptation would be far reaching as\n\nvirtually all cell lines have been adapted to TCP and some primary cells are expanded on TCP\n\nprior to usage in basic biology research or usage in biomedical devices  In all cases  timing will\n\nbe critical  As demonstrated by Yang et al  [29]  short term passaging of MSCs on substrates of\nsupraphysiologic stiffness  such as TCP may lead to reversible changes in cell behaviors  but\n\nthey become irreversible after a threshold period of time \n\nConclusions\nHere  we examined how MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells adapt to their environ-\n\nment upon prolonged culturing on PA gels of varying stiffness  Cells cultured for 9 d on com-\n\npliant PA gels displayed increase in cell spreading area  cell spreading rate  cell attachment and\n\nproliferation and decrease in circularity with prolonged time in culture  Table 2  Interestingly \n\ndifferences in cell behaviors between soft and stiff hydrogels diminished or disappeared with\n\nMorphological

\nreceptor 2  HER2 - negative breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines \nand taxanes were eligible  Patients with brain metastases and homozygous for \nUGT1A1 *6 or *28 or compound heterozygous  *6/*28  were excluded  A dose- \nescalation design was chosen for the phase I portion  level 1  irinotecan 80 mg/\nm2 days 1–8 and S- 1 80 mg/m2 days 1–14 every 3 weeks  level 2  irinotecan \n100 mg/m2 and S- 1 80 mg/m2  Study objectives included determination of the \nrecommended dose for phase II  response rate  progression- free survival  PFS  \nand safety  Pharmacokinetics and CD34+ circulating endothelial cells  CECs  as \npharmacodynamics were also analyzed  Thirty- seven patients were included  One \npatient at each level developed dose- limiting toxicities  therefore  level 2 was \nthe recommended dose for phase II  Diarrhea was more common in patients \npossessing a *6 or *28 allele compared with wild- type homozygous patients \n 46% and 25%  Among 29 patients treated at level 2  PFS was longer for \nUGT1A1 wt/*6 and wt/*28 patients than for wt/wt patients  12 vs  8 months  \nP = 0 06  PFS was significantly longer in patients with a larger- than- median \nSN- 38 area under the curve  AUC  than in those with a smaller AUC  P = 0 039  \nThere was an association between clinical benefit and reduction in baseline \nCD34+ CECs by S- 1  P = 0 047  The combination of irinotecan and S- 1 is \neffective and warrants further investigation \n\nCancer Medicine\nOpen Access\n\n\n\n\n\n2910 © 2017 The Authors  Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd  \n\nH  Ishiguro et al Irinotecan/S- 1 Combination with PK/PD\n\nand taxanes  and a synergistic effect of 5- FU and irinotecan \nhas been noted [4]  their combination is attractive  \nFurthermore  intratumoral dihydropyrimidine dehydroge-\nnases  DPDs  are often elevated in breast cancer  and the \nincorporation of a DPD inhibitor  as in S- 1  might be \nadvantageous [5] \n\nSN- 38 is an active metabolite of irinotecan  that is  \nexcreted after conjugation to form the inactive compound \nSN- 38G with glucuronic acid by uridine diphosphate  UDP - \nglucuronosyl transferase  UGT  1A1  Variants of the gene \nfor UGT1A1 exist  and in patients with certain polymor-\nphisms  those who are homozygous for UGT1A1*6/*6 or \nUGT1A1*28/*28  or heterozygous  UGT1A1*6/*28  glucu-\nronidation is impaired  resulting in an increase in the risk \nof serious adverse reactions to irinotecan [6–8] \n\nCirculating endothelial cells  CECs  comprise two distinct \npopulations  vascular- derived mature CECs  elicited by \ndamage to the endothelium of the vasculature  and bone- \nmarrow- derived circulating endothelial progenitors  CEPs  \nwhich contribute to neovascularization  Although CD34 is \nexpressed not only in endothelial progenitor cells but also \nin some of the mature endothelial cells  it has been widely \nused to identify progenitor cells with clonogenic potential \n[9]  A reduction in CEPs is strongly correlated with antian-\ngiogenic effects [10]  Because vascular endothelial growth \nfactor- A- driven tumor angiogenesis for the formation of \na functional vascular bed and the subsequent tumor growth \npartly depend on the mobilization of CEPs  a change in \nthe CEP level may be a predictive marker for antiangio-\ngenesis therapy [11]  In our previous studies [12  13]  the \nCD34+ CEC level was closely associated with the treatment \nresponse to chemotherapy  including S- 1 \n\nWe therefore conducted a phase I/II study of combined \ntherapy with irinotecan plus S- 1 in patients with recur-\nrent/metastatic breast cancer who had already received \nboth anthracyclines and taxanes  including analyses of \npharmacokinetics  pharmacogenomics  and CECs/CEPs as \npotential pharmacodynamic markers \n\nMethods\n\nPatients\n\nPatients were included if they had pathologically confirmed \nrecurrent and/or metastatic human epidermal growth fac-\ntor receptor 2  HER2 - negative breast cancer  were aged \n75 or younger and had previously received anthracycline \nand taxane chemotherapy  including adjuvant and/or neo-\nadjuvant use  All patients were required to have a meas-\nurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria \nin Solid Tumors  RECIST  guideline version 1 0 [14]  \nOther criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology \nGroup performance status of 0–2  expected survival of \n\nlonger than 12 weeks  adequate organ function  a white \nblood cell count of ≥3000/mm3 or an absolute neutrophil \ncount of ≥1500/mm3  a platelet count of ≥10 × 104/mm3  \na hemoglobin level of ≥9 0 g/dL  aspartate transaminase \n AST /alanine aminotransferase  ALT  levels of ≤2 × the \nupper normal limit  total bilirubin ≤1 5 mg/dL  a creatinine \nlevel of ≤1 2 mg/dL  estimated creatinine clearance of \n≥50 mL/min  and oxygen saturation >90%  All patients \nprovided written informed consent  Patients were excluded \nif they had brain metastases  diarrhea  ileus  clinically \nsignificant infection  a significant amount of fluid reten-\ntion  interstitial pneumonitis  or another clinically signifi-\ncant condition  Eligible patients were preregistered and a \ntest for UGT1A1 genetic polymorphism was performed  \nPatients who were homozygous for UGT1A1*6 or *28  \nor compound heterozygous  6/*28  were excluded \n\nStudy design\n\nThis was a phase I/II  multicenter clinical trial  Phase I \nwas a dose- escalation study using the standard 3 + 3 \ndesign  Patients received 80  level 1  or 100 mg/m2  level \n2  of intravenous irinotecan on days 1 and 8 plus 80 mg/\nm2/day of oral S- 1 from day 1 through day 14  Cycles \nwere repeated every 21 days until the prespecified dis-\ncontinuation criteria was met  Dose- limiting toxicities were \ndefined as ≥grade 3 nonhematological toxicities  grade 4 \nneutropenia  or febrile neutropenia during the first cycle  \nThe maximum tolerated dose  MTD  was defined as the \ndose at which more than one patient in every three patients \nexperienced dose- limiting toxicities  The dose one level \nlower than the MTD  or level 2 if no MTD was observed  \nwas defined as the recommended dose \n\nThe primary endpoint of phase II was response and \nclinical benefit rate  Secondary endpoints included safety  \nprogression- free survival  PFS  and overall survival  OS  \nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review \nboard at each participating study center before initiation \nand was conducted in accordance with the Ethical Guideline \nfor Clinical Studies and Human Genome/Gene Analysis \nResearch by the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare  \nJapan and the Declaration of Helsinki  The study was \nregistered in the University Hospital Medical Information \nNetwork Clinical Trial Registry managed by the National \nUniversity Hospital Council of Japan and operated by the \nUniversity of Tokyo Hospital  UMIN000000517  All patient \ninformation forms were collected and managed by the \nJapan Breast Cancer Research Group  JBCRG  data center \n\nStudy

\nPartial response  PR  and complete response  CR  were \nconfirmed by repeated assessment at least 4 weeks apart  \nStable disease  SD  was evaluated at least 8 weeks after study \ntreatment began  if it continued beyond 24 weeks  it was \ndefined as long SD  Clinical benefit was defined as either \nCR  PR  or long SD  PFS was defined as the time between \ntreatment initiation and disease

PGx  analysis for UGT1A1 *6 and \n*28 was conducted by Bio Medical Laboratories  Inc  The \npharmacokinetics  PK  of irinotecan were assessed during \nthe first cycle for patients enrolled at Kyoto University \nHospital  with additional informed consent  Blood samples \nwere obtained prior to irinotecan infusion and at 10  60  \n120  and 240 min after the end of infusion  Plasma con-\ncentrations of irinotecan  SN- 38  and SN- 38G were meas-\nured by high- performance liquid chromatography at ADME \n& Tox  Research Institute  Sekisui Medical Co  Ltd  Ibaraki  \nJapan  PK parameters were calculated with WinNonlin \nProfessional ver  5 0 1 software  Pharsight Co  Mountain \nView  CA  USA  using a linear trapezoidal model  For \npharmacodynamics  PD  analysis  we used CD34+ CECs \nas a marker for CEPs  CD34+ CECs were measured using \na CellSearch system  Veridex LLC  Co  Ltd  NJ  USA  \nCECs were classified as 4 6- diamino- 2- phenylindole \n DAPI +  CD45−  CD146+  or CD105+ and were subse-\nquently stained with an anti- CD34 antibody and evaluated \nwith an extra channel in the CellSearch system \n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe main objective of the phase II portion of the study \nwas to test the null hypothesis that the response rate \n RR  is 10% against the alternative of 30% using a single- \nstage binomial study design  An RR of <10% was deemed \nunacceptable based on previous data from a study of S- 1 \n[1]  At least 33 patients were required in phase II with \na one- sided alpha of 0 05 and a beta of 0 2  The Kaplan–\nMeier method was used to estimate survival curves  and \nthe log- rank test and univariate Cox proportional hazards \nmodel were used to evaluate the association between \nUGT1A1 genetic polymorphisms and survival outcomes  \nThe Mann–Whitney U- test was used to compare CD34+ \n\nCEC counts during combination treatment  All reported \nP values were two- sided  P < 0 05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant  and 90% confidence intervals  CIs  were \ncalculated with the Clopper and Pearson method  Statistical \nanalyses were performed with SAS Release 9 3  SAS Institute \nInc  Cary  NC  USA  and JMP v9 0 0

phase II  between November 2006 and \nJune 2011  the trial closed before full enrollment due to \npoor accrual   Fig  1  One patient was excluded from \neach phase  leaving 35 patients for analysis  12 for phase \nl and 23 for phase II  All patients had received two or \nmore previous chemotherapies other than anthracyclines \nand taxanes and the majority had visceral metastases such \nas hepatic disease  Table 1 \n\nThe median number of irinotecan cycles and dose \nintensity were not different between patients with one of \nthe UGT1A1 polymorphisms and homozygous wild- type \npatients  Table 2 \n\nAmong the 29 patients treated at level 2  RR  clinical \nbenefit rate  CR + PR + long SD  PFS  and OS were \nnumerically better for patients who were heterozygous \nfor *6 or *28 compared with those for patients who were \nwild- type homozygous  Table 3  Figures 2A and B show \nKaplan–Meyer curves by UGT1A1 genotype for PFS and \nOS at treatment level 2  Although not statistically signifi-\ncant  the median PFS  12 vs  8 months  hazard ratio \n[HR] 0 47  P = 0 060  Fig  2C  and median OS  23 vs  \n17 months  HR 0 74  P = 0 56  were longer for the het-\nerozygous patients compared with the homozygous wild- \ntype patients  respectively \n\nDiarrhea was more common in patients possessing a \n*6 or *28 allele compared with wild- type homozygous \npatients  Table 4 \n\nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics\n\nFor 16 patients  the PK of irinotecan  SN- 38 and SN- 38G \nwere assessed during the first cycle on days 1 and 8  five \npatients did not receive

require a \nhigher dose of irinotecan \n\nFor patients with disease refractory to anthracyclines \nand taxanes  single agent chemotherapy with agents such \nas irinotecan delivered at the MTD given every few weeks \nis an option for patients with low tumor burden  but \nPFS is relatively short and combination chemotherapy \nstrategies are largely not successful [17]  We have previ-\nously reported that a low baseline CD34+ CEC level was \n\nassociated with higher pathological CR in primary breast \ncancer [12]  Cytotoxic chemotherapy increases the CD34+ \nCEC count  possibly owing to the damage to normal ves-\nsels [12]  Chemotherapy can be more frequently admin-\nistered at low doses  resulting in fewer side effects and \na better quality of life  this is known as metronomic \nchemotherapy  Capecitabine and S- 1 meet the character-\nistics of metronomic chemotherapy  This mode of admin-\nistration suppresses the induction of endothelial cells from \nthe bone marrow [18] and decreases CD34+ CEC levels \n[13]  There could be a good rationale for combining \n\nFigure 5   A  Comparison of the baseline CD34+ CEC level before irinotecan administration between days 1 and 8

[1–3]\n\njor subtypes of breast cancer  luminal A and B  Her2 \nd normal-like  are very different in clinical characters\nnosis [4] Inﬂammation plays an important role in cancer \nd more studies have found that cancer and inﬂammation\nly related to each other  Not only inﬂammation results in\n\ncancer but also cancer causes inﬂammation  Serum interleukin\n IL -6  IL-8 that are linked to inﬂammation and macrophages in\nthe tumor microenvironment  TME  have been identiﬁed as\nunfavorable factors for cancer patients’ survival [5 6] Further-\nmore  anti-inﬂammation agents such as aspirin have been put in a\nnew height in cancer prevention and therapy \nAs a parameter that can reﬂect inﬂammation and host immune\n\nreaction  blood neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  NLR  has\nreceived much attention in predicting the prognosis of cancer \nLarge numbers of studies have demonstrated that high NLR is\nrelated to poor prognosis of malignant tumor  including breast\ncancer  lung cancer  gastric cancer  colorectal cancer  and\nprostate cancer [7–11] Most studies showed that elevated NLR\ncould be a predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients \nHowever  some studies could not support this conclusion very\nwell [12 13]\n\nIn the meta-analysis by Chen et al [14] only 8 earlier studies\nwere enrolled  Therefore  we performed this meta-analysis in\nwhich we included the newest studies to further clarify the\nrelationship between NLR and prognosis of breast cancer\npatients \n\n2  Materials and method\n\n2 1  Search strategy and selection criteria\n\nA selective literature

Access\n\nClinicopathologic and prognostic features\nof breast cancer in young women  a series\nfrom North of Morocco\nJoaira Bakkach1*   Mohamed Mansouri1 2  Touria Derkaoui1  Ali Loudiyi2  Mohamed Fihri3  Samia Hassani1 \nAmina Barakat1  Naima Ghailani Nourouti1 and Mohcine Bennani Mechita1\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground  Literature data reported a higher frequency of breast cancer in young women  BCYW  in developing\ncountries  BCYW is associated with delayed diagnosis  aggressive biology and poor prognosis  However  our\nknowledge of biological profile  treatment received and outcome of young patients is still limited in Morocco  We\npropose to analyze clinicopathologic  therapeutic and prognostic features of BCYW among a series of patients\nnative and/or inhabitant of North of Morocco \n\nMethods  We carried out a retro-prospective study of 331 infiltrating breast cancer cases registered between January\n2010 and December 2015  Details of tumor pathology  treatment and outcome were collected  Disease-Free Survival\n DFS  and Overall Survival  OS  were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis \n\nResults  A total of 82 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 or younger  24 8%  Median age was\n36 years  More than one quarter  26%  of patients had family history of breast or ovarian cancer  Advanced stages\naccounted for 34 2% of cases  Median tumor diameter was 2 8 cm  Intermediate and high-grade tumors represented\n47 6% and 40 2%  respectively  Nodal involvement was present in 58 5% and lymphovascular invasion was found in 47 \n7% of the patients  About two thirds  66 2%  of tumors were hormone receptor positive  29 2% over-expressed HER2\nreceptor and 23% were triple negative  Patients underwent breast conserving surgery in 38 2% of cases  61 7% were\noffered adjuvant chemotherapy and 84 6% received hormone therapy  Five-year DFS and OS were respectively 88 9%\nand 75 6%  Locoregional recurrence occurred in 2 8% of cases and 8 3% of patients developed distant metastases \n\nConclusion  Our findings are in accordance with previous studies that have shown a higher frequency of breast\ncancer among Moroccan young women  In line with literature data  clinicopathologic profile seems to be aggressive\nand prognosis is pejorative in our series \n\nKeywords  Breast cancer  Young women  BRCA1  BRCA2  Aggressive biology  Poor prognosis  Survival analysis\n\nBackground\nOverall  breast cancer risk increases with the age  Inci-\ndence rates are shown to be lower among young women\nand the peak is within the age range of 65–74 years in\nmore developed countries [1]  However in Morocco  the\nmedian age at onset for breast cancer is decade younger \nAccording to the Greater Casablanca Cancer Registry re-\nport 2012  the peak incidence is at the age group 40–\n\n49 years [2]  Moreover  hospital-based series reported that\nbreast cancer in young women  BCYW  do account for 8\nto 25 4% [3–6]  whereas this frequency does not exceed\n7% in developed countries [7] \nYoung women deserve a particular attention because\n\nof the unique and complex challenges that these women\nare faced with [8]  These breast cancer patients have to\ndeal with many issues related to fertility  self-image  psy-\nchosocial distress and professional integration  On the\nother hand  breast cancer in this age category tends to\nexhibit more aggressive features than that arising in\n\n* Correspondence  joairaa@gmail com\n1Human Genomic Research Laboratory  Faculty of Sciences and Techniques\nof Tangier  University Abdelmalek Essaâdi

risk and poor survival [15–17] \nThe reason for this aggressiveness remains unclear  Histor-\nically  young age has been shown to be an independent\npredictor factor for poor prognosis [13  18  19]  However \nrecently with the emergence of molecular classification \nthis association with young age has disappeared in some\nstudies [14  20]  Currently  it is controversial whether\nBCYW is a unique biologic entity or it just reflects an\nover-representation of more aggressive molecular sub-\ntypes [21] \nYoung age for breast cancer occurrence often suggests\n\nan underlying genetic predisposition especially muta-\ntions in BRCA1/2 genes and less frequently in p53 \nOverall  BRCA1/2 genetic alterations may explain 10%\nof breast carcinomas arising in young women [22]  but\nin studies from Arab countries much higher proportions\nhave been reported [23  24]  In Morocco  the young age\nfor breast cancer diagnosis also strongly suggests that\ngenetic factors could be involved \nWe are conducting a genetic study to explore\n\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among breast cancer\npatients diagnosed at the age of 40 years or younger \nThis is the first genetic study including a case-series\nfrom North of Morocco  In this paper  we present a\ndescription of clinicopathologic  therapeutic and prog-\nnostic features among these south Mediterranean\npatients seen at the Oncology Clinic AL AMAL in\nTangier  the only institution specialized in diagnosis\nand treatment of cancers available in the North Moroccan\narea at the beginning of the study \n\nMethods\nA total of 331 patients with invasive breast carcinoma\nwere referred to the Oncology Clinic AL AMAL in Tan-\ngier between January 2010 and December 2015  Only\npatients diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 or\nyounger were recruited 82  24 8% \nMedical records were reviewed and details of clin-\n\nical characteristics  tumor pathology and treatment re-\nceived were recorded  Family history  ethnic origin\nand any missing information were completed at\nfollow-up visits  Patients with bilateral breast cancer\nwere recorded only once \nTumors were classified by means of TNM system\n\n2010 and regrouped according to the American Joint\nCommittee on Cancer stages  AJCC 2010  Histologic\ngrading was performed according to SBR classification\nmodified by Elston and Elliss  mSBR  Hormone

PR positivity was ≥1% \nHER2  Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2  ex-\npression was processed immunohistochemicaly from\nparaffin-embedded cancer tissue using the HercepTest \nTumors scored 2+ were completed by FISH or CISH\nmethods \nPatients were followed until 22 August 2016  The\n\nfollow-up schedule was  every 4 months during the first\n2 years  every 6 months for the next 2–5 years and every\nyear thereafter  All patients who were not reviewed in\nthe last visit were contacted again \nFive-year overall survival  OS  and Disease-free sur-\n\nvival  DFS  were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier ana-\nlysis  These were defined from the date of diagnosis to\nany tumor relapse or last follow-up  DFS  and to death\nor last follow-up  OS  The Log-Rank test was used to\nassess statistical difference between survival curves ac-\ncording to stages  This test was performed at a 5% level \nParticipants provided an informed written consent \n\nThis study received approval from

and 3 \n\nDiscussion\nBCYW is a complex topic to discuss because there is no\nunified definition of “young age”  The most used defini-\ntions place the limit at 35 or 40 years  This definition’s\nvariability creates non-homogeneity between studies \nwhich complicates the interpretation of the results  In\nthe present work we have chosen to define early onset\nbreast cancer when diagnosed at the age of 40 or\nyounger \n\nBreast cancer is described as young women disease in\nArab world and other developing nations like some Afri-\ncan and Asian countries [25  26]  Compared to that ob-\nserved in western countries  median age for breast\ncancer diagnosis is a decade younger  and approximately\ntwo thirds of patients are aged under 50 [27]  Our re-\nsults are in accordance with previous studies describing\na higher proportion of early onset breast cancer in\nMorocco  Our frequency among women diagnosed at\nthe age of 40 or younger  24 8%  is consistent with data\nfrom Greater Casablanca Cancer Registry  22%  the only\npopulation-based registry that exists in Morocco since\n2007 [28]  This result is also similar to a recent study\nconducted at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat\n 24 9%  [6]  Other national hospital-based series have\nshowed disparate results among women aged under 36\n[3–5]  In our study  women aged under 36 represent\n11 2%  As our case-series is limited  we could not draw\nany conclusions about the frequency of early onset\nbreast cancer in the North Moroccan region \nThe young age for breast cancer diagnosis in Morocco\n\nraises the question of whether demographic  genetic or\nenvironmental factors are implicated  Young age pyra-\nmid has been invoked to explain the higher frequency\ncompared to western countries  Moreover  absence of\nmass screening could be an additional factor that sug-\ngests an under-estimation of breast cancer among older\nwomen [29  30]  This factor  alone  is however insuffi-\ncient to explain the young age for breast cancer occur-\nrence in Morocco  The genetic component should be\nmore explored  since genetic studies including young\nwomen are very scarce nationwide  and there is still in-\nsufficient data to provide conclusive evidence [31  32] \nIn our study  the higher frequency could be explained by\na recruitment bias or could simply be due to the young\nage of the population in this region [33] \nIn the absence of a national registry that covers the\n\nwhole Moroccan population  the real frequency of early\nonset breast cancer remains to be determined  Larger\nstudies and subsequent analyses are extremely warranted \nMorocco is an ethnically diverse North African coun-\n\ntry that comprises Arabs  Amazighs  Sub-Saharan\ngroups  Jews and Europeans  In our series including pa-\ntients native and/or inhabitant of North of Morocco \nmost  98 8%  patients were Arab or Amazigh descent \nThese are the most frequent ethnicities in this region \nOur case-series could not provide any conclusion about\nthe contribution of these ethnic groups in BCYW  To\nthe best of our knowledge  no data is available at the na-\ntional scale about the incidence of BCYW among these\ndifferent ethnic groups \nPresence of a familial background has been identified\n\nas an important risk factor for developing breast cancer\nat an early age [34]  and to be suggestive of a hereditary\n\nTable 4 Treatment modalities  82 patients \n\nParameter Frequency\n\nSurgery\n\nNo 16 7%\n\nYes 83 3%\n\nRadical 61 8%\n\nConservative 38 2%\n\nChemotherapy\n\nNo 9

study\n 24%  Larger series have reported much higher propor-\ntions up to 48% [12  16  17  35] \nIt has been recommended that young women with\n\npersonal history of breast cancer should be considered\nfor genetic counseling  and BRCA1/2 testing even when\nnot meeting familial criteria  Published data about\n\nreferral patterns showed that the proportion of young\nbreast cancer patients who underwent BRCA1/2 testing\nhas been increased in the last decade particularly be-\ntween 2012 and 2013 [36]  This trend of genetic coun-\nseling referrals observed in developed countries has been\nrelated to the media attention to the hereditary breast\ncancer risk “The Angelina Jolie Effect” [37  38]  Sadly \nsuch data is yet to become available nationwide because\nthe interest for genetic disorders is recent in Morocco \n\nFig  1 Overall survival at 5 years for 82 patients\n\nFig  2 Survival for 82 patients according to AJCC stages  pvalue = 0 001\n\nBakkach et al  BMC Women's Health   2017  17 106 Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\nand no medical genetic centers have been established\nuntil the end of 1990s [39] \nThe age cut-off used for BRCA1/2 genetic screening\n\namong young women varies widely between countries \nFrench recommendations use a cut-off of 36 years [40] \nwhereas the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\nguidelines recommend screening in women aged youn-\nger than 45 [41]  Adoption of any of these international\nstandards should generally be tailored to each popula-\ntion’s specificity  Decision-making is however difficult\nfor Morocco as well as other similar countries  because\nno legal framework for genetic counseling services is\navailable  besides the knowledge about mutation preva-\nlence is still limited to provide sufficient evidence  Fur-\nther genetic studies would be therefore extremely\nhelpful in order to define the appropriate age cut-off \nYoung age at onset for breast cancer has been shown\n\nto increase the risk of subsequent contralateral cancer \nThis higher risk might be explained somewhat by genetic\nsusceptibility especially mutations in BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes [42]  In our series  two patients had a per-\nsonal history of contralateral breast cancer  The first\nbreast cancers were of luminal type  whereas the second\ncancers were triple negative  Such difference was not ob-\nserved by Huo et al  [43] who described a strong con-\ncordance in hormone receptor status between primary\nand second breast cancers \nDiagnosis in young women has been considered diffi-\n\ncult to establish both clinically and mammographically\ndue to the increased breast density within this age\ngroup  Generally  this is translated into more advanced\n\nstages at disease presentation  In line with these ob-\nservations  we described a diagnosis delay  but the\nproportion of advanced-stage disease remains much\nhigher than that reported in western series  34 2% Vs \n19%  [16] \nIt has been reported that breast cancer occurring in\n\nyounger women has more aggressive features  The\ntumors were more likely to be undifferentiated  with\nhigher proliferation index  more nodal involvement  less\npositive hormone receptor status and with an over-\nexpression of HER2 [9–14] \nProportion of high-grade tumors in our series  40 2% \n\nremains relatively low compared with western series \nwhich reported more higher rates up to 58 9% among\nyoung women under 40 [11  12  15–17]  This could be\nexplained by the presence in our study of an important\nrate of intermediate grade tumors  47 6% \nHaving node involvement  ≥ 4 nodes  is a poor prog-\n\nnostic factor which is considered as an indication for ad-\njuvant chemotherapy according to the 2015 St Gallen\nInternational Consensus guidelines [44]  In previous\npublications  lymph node-positive disease in young\nwomen under 40 years seems to be ranged from 39 2%\nto 53% [9  11  12  15  17]  In the current study  58 5% of\npatients had positive lymph nodes \nSeveral studies have shown age-specific disparity in\n\nhormone receptors status [9–12  14]  In recent series \nrate of hormone-negative tumors has been around 34%\n[15–17  45]  The proportion of HER2 over-expressing\ntumors in published reports ranged from 15 2% to 48%\n[9  15–17  45]  In accordance with these data  we found\n\nFig  3 Disease-free survival at 5 years for non-metastatic patients\n\nBakkach et al  BMC Women's Health   2017  17 106 Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\nthat 33 8% of tumors were HR-negative and 29 2% over-\nexpressed HER2 \nTumor biology and molecular pathways involved in\n\nearly-onset breast cancers are widely unknown  Based\non IHC or gene expression profiling  published data have\nshown that for unclear reasons younger women have\ntendency for more aggressive subtypes [10  14  16  45] \nThe proportion of luminal cancers in our study is almost\nidentical  66 2%  to that reported by Collins et al  [16] \nbut we have not sufficient data for Ki-67 to permit clas-\nsification into types A and B  HER2 and triple negative\nphenotypes were found respectively in 10 8% and 23% of\nthe cases  consistent with Keegan et al  [45] study  Clini-\ncopathologic and prognostic features of the triple nega-\ntive group diagnosed in our institution have been\nrecently published  This study revealed that approxi-\nmately two thirds  63 6%  of the patients were non-\nmenopausal [46] \nThe choice of surgical treatment type depends mainly\n\non risk factors of local recurrence  ratio of cosmetic/car-\ncinological results and patient’s informed decision \nYoung age  especially ≤35 years  has been considered as\nrisk factor for local recurrence following breast-\nconserving surgery [47]  but despite this increased risk\nthere is a great evidence for no survival benefit for\nundergoing radical treatment rather than conserving\nsurgery [47  48] \nWe described in our study that most  61 8%  of\n\npatients underwent radical surgery  This could be partly\nexplained by the presence of many limitations for man-\nagement of breast conserving surgery  The radiological\nsurveillance by Magnetic Resonance Imaging  MRI  is\noften discussed for BCYW  as it is the most sensitive test\n more than 90%  for detecting small and/or multicentric\nrelapse in dense breasts [49  50]  but unfortunately this\nimaging modality is still expensive  which substantially\nhinders better management \nSeveral publications have revealed that breast cancer\n\nyoung patients have had poor prognosis with increased\nrisk of locoregional recurrence and lower survival [11–13 \n18  19  51]  Buckley et al  [52] reported a 5-year locoregio-\nnal recurrence rate of 5 56%  whereas another study by\nPlichta et al  [53] described a 5-year locoregional recur-\nrence rate of 2%  almost similar to that found in our series\n 2 8% \nData from the present study showed that the 5-year\n\nOS  75 6%  was comparable to that previously reported\nin older series [19  51]  but this was still lower compared\nwith recent reports [17  53]  Furthermore  this OS was\nmuch lower for patients with advanced-stage disease \nSurvival according to stages revealed that OS at 5 years\nin advanced stages was significantly inferior to that in\nearly stages  57 1% Vs  85 2%  pvalue = 0 001 < 0 05 \nOverall  the poor prognosis observed in our series may\n\nbe partly explained by a substantial delayed diagnosis \nbut other factors are likely to be involved including the\naggressive biology or potential socioeconomic factors \nThe present study showed some limitations  This is a\n\nsize limited case-series recruiting patients from only one\nhealth institution  As such  it could not be representative\nof the whole North Moroccan region  The retrospective\ncharacter of some data represents another limitation  In\naddition  our study is conducted in the private sector \nwhich could represent a recruitment bias \n\nConclusion\nOur results are in accordance with literature data report-\ning higher proportion of breast cancer among young\nMoroccan women  Larger studies are warranted to con-\nfirm our findings \nInterestingly  our ongoing genetic study for identifying\n\ngermline mutations in BRCA genes would contribute to\na better understanding of the genetic profile of patients\ninvolved in this series \nConsistent with published reports  we described\n\naggressive biologic features  There was seen much higher\nproportion of advanced-stage disease in our study  which\nreflects somewhat a substantial delay in diagnosis  In\nterms of treatment choices  our patients underwent rad-\nical mastectomy rather than conserving surgery  which\nadds further challenge for these young women at the\nemotional and psychosocial levels  especially in the ab-\nsence of a specialized psychological support \n\nAbbreviations\nACR  American College of Radiology  AJCC  American Joint Committee of\nCancer  BCYW

is a shattering tumor and an important\ncause of worldwide death [1]  Recently published data\nstated that breast neoplasms are the most frequent\nmalignancy among females with approximately 1 700 000\nnew registered cases and around 580 000 demises of BC\nin the United States of America in 2015 according to the\nAmerican Cancer Society [2]  In Saudi Arabia  BC has a\ncomparable rank among cancers and neoplasms\naccounting for  25 8%  of all registered neoplasms in\nfemales in 2012 as stated by the Saudi Cancer Registry [3] \nBC has been distinguished as a high complex heteroge-\n\nneous tumor with distinctive cellular origin and various\nhistotypes  progression and metastatic potential [4]  Irre-\nspective of noteworthy improvements in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of BC  the tumor is still considered a big chal-\nlenge to clinicians due to bad prognosis and big recurrence\nproportion in some histotypes of BC particularly triple\nnegative  for instance up to 40% of newly registered cases\nrelapse in 5 years [5]  The management of BC is subject to\nthe clinicopathological parameters of patients  such as\ngrade and stage of cancer as measures of pleasant or bad\nprognosis  Nevertheless  these factors are not enough to\nguess the clinical consequences and worse yet  may pro-\nduce variations in a cluster of neoplasms with the same\ngrade or stage  This is essentially due to heterogeneity of\nBC cells [6]  Therefore  it is necessary to find novel diagnos-\ntic markers and medicinal modalities which help in the\ndiagnosis and prognosis of BC  enhance the stratification of\nhigh risk patients and improve clinical outcomes [7] \nLeptin is one hundred and sixty seven amino acid\n\nresidues molecule that is encrypted by the Obese gene  Ob \n[8]  It was expressed firstly in white adipose tissue  however \nlater it was found that other tissues express leptin such as\nthe liver  ovaries  placenta  stomach  pituitary gland and\nskeletal muscles [9]  It is now established that leptin has\nseveral roles and counted a member of adipokines [10] \nMany investigations have illustrated the function of leptin\nin tumor cells proliferation  movement  invasion and apop-\ntosis inhibition [11–13]  Some other reports have examined\nleptin function in several tumor development risks  but the\nresults are controversial [14  15]  Unquestionably definite\nproof is needed to elucidate leptin’s exact function in the\ngrowth and progress of breast tumors  as perception of\nleptin correlation with breast cancer can improve our\nawareness of breast carcinogenesis and support improving\nmanagement and preventive plans  Thus  the current study\ndescribes leptin immunoexpression in BC and evaluates the\nassociation between leptin phenotype and the clinical\nfactors as well as follow-up data of breast cancer \n\nMethods\nFour hundred fourty nine cases of BC and 27 control\ncases  which include fibroadenomas and normal breast\n\ntissue  were taken from the archive of pathological sci-\nences department at King Abdulaziz University Hospital\nin Saudi Arabia  Sections from tumor paraffin blocks\nwere hematoxylin and eosin stained and histologically\nevaluated  The unit of medical records provided us with\npatients’ clinicopathological data  age  size  type  grade\nand stage of tumors   Table 1  WHO recommendation\nregarding grade and stage of BC was applied  All tumors\nand control cases blocks were utilized in the production\nof tissue microarray  This study has met all the instruc-\ntion and requirement of the ethical committee approval \n\nTissue microarray production  TMA \nFour hundred fourty nine cases of BC and 27 control\ncases were used to assemble tissue microarray [16] \nTMA blocks have been cut and placed on coated slides \nthen they have been immunohistochemically stained \n\nImmunohistochemistry staining protocol\nMultimer molecule based scientific knowledge were\nemployed in the immunohistochemistry staining of BC\nsections to apply anti-leptin rabbit polyclonal antibody\nwith dilution ratio of 1 to 100 [catalog code  sc-842 \nSanta Cruz Biotechnology  USA  and ULTRAVIEW TM\nDAB visualizing protocol  Immunohistochemistry auto-\nstainer  BenchMark ULTRA  Ventana  Arizona  USA \nwas used for immunohistochemistry staining  Every\nstaining run contained a slide treated with tris buffer in\nplace of the Ob antibody as a negative control  Slide\nsection of placenta tissue was employed as positive\ncontrol  Cases with brown granular cytoplasmic stain in\nmore than 5% of tumor cells were counted positive \nLeptin immunoreactivity has been scored  by two\n\npathologists  for staining intensity and positively stained\ncells percentage  The frequency of positive cells was\nevaluated applying semiquantitative method in 3 fields\nwith lenses of 40 amplification power  Leptin staining\nintensity has been given scores 0  1  2  3 and 4 represent-\ning negative  weak  moderate and strong staining\nrespectively  Scores of staining intensity has been\npresented as negative staining  0  low level immunore-\nactivity  1  and high level  2 and 3  When a disparity\nbetween the two pathologists’ staining scores has\nhappened  the lowest score value was reported \n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were assessed statistically by IBM-SPSS software\n version 21  All data values were presented as percent-\nages and incidences  The association between clinico-\npathological factors of BC and leptin expression was\nexplored statistically by chi-square test  Comparison of\nsurvival distributions for various leptin immunohisto-\nchemistry staining intensity levels was assessed applying\nLog Rank  Mantel-Cox  test in addition to Kaplan Meier\n\nKhabaz et al  BMC Women's Health

mechanisms which link leptin\nwith tumor growth and progression of breast cancer [22 \n23]  Some studies reported a direct role of leptin in BC\ndevelopment and aggression  and others showed that\nserum adipocytokines apply their biological roles on\nrecipient tissues and cells not just by typical endocrino-\nlogical mechanisms but additionally via autocrine or\nparacrine systems [11  22–29]  However  leptin expres-\nsion in mammary tumor tissue is not characteristic of\nblood leptin levels  but could be a result of the paracrine\nmechanism [22]  Furthermore  leptin intervenes estrogen\neffects on malignant tissue via a paracrine pathway  as\nwell as enhances other influences that participate in cell\ngrowth and angiogenesis during breast cancer develop-\nment [23  30]  Moreover  leptin autoregulation enhances\nits signal through motivating its expression and its\nreceptor  thus supports an autocrine mechanism [29] \nTo the best of our knowledge  few studies evaluated lep-\ntin expression in breast cancer tissues  Table 2  [31–40]\nof which the outcomes failed to confirm the results of\nleptin serological studies and the correlation of leptin\nimmunoexpression with clinicopathological findings of\nbreast carcinoma patients \nIn our report  the incidence of leptin immunostaining\n\n 92 6%  in the 27 control cases  which was seen only in\nthe cytoplasmic space of glandular epithelial cells  is al-\nmost similar to the results of Ishikawa  Kitayama and\n\nNagawa [31] who described positive leptin immunohisto-\nchemistry staining in 100% of noncancerous breast tissue \nand higher than those of Caldefie-Chezet and associates\n[32]  Garofalo et al  [33]  Jarde and coworkers [35]  and\nColbert and colleagues [40]  In respect of the percentage\nof positive breast carcinoma cases for leptin immunoex-\npression  our results are in line with those of Garofalo and\nassociates [33]  Fiorio and coworkers [36]  Jarde and asso-\nciates [37] and Jeong team [39] who detected leptin\nimmunoexpression in 86 4%  79 6%  79 6% and 83% of\nbreast carcinomas respectively  but with different immu-\nnoreactivity levels  and varied from those of Ishikawa \nKitayama and Nagawa [31]  Caldefie-Chezet and associ-\nates [32]  Kim [38] and Colbert and colleagues [40] \nOur investigation is pioneer to report immunohisto-\n\nchemical staining of leptin is considerably correlated\nwith patients’ clinicopathological findings such as age \nhistotype  grade  stage  recurrence  lymph node involve-\nment  hormone receptor phenotype  ER expression \nHER2 expression and survival of patients with breast\ncarcinoma  Whereas  all the previous studies  Table 2 \ndid not detect similar correlation except Ishikawa \nKitayama and Nagawa [31] who reported that strong\nleptin immunostaining is only associated with poor sur-\nvival  Garofalo and associates [33] associated leptin im-\nmunostaining only with high grade tumors  Jeong and\ncolleagues [39] linked leptin expression with histotype\nof breast cancer  and Colbert and coworkers [40]\nstated significant relationship with triple negative\nbreast carcinoma \n\nFig  2 Kaplan

Page 6 of 8\n\n\n\nNevertheless  our results are in agreement with several\nother reports which have documented that immunoex-\npression of leptin is linked with one or more of the clin-\nical factors such as tumor stage  infiltration  metastasis \nrelapse  therapy resistance and bad prognostic outcomes\nof several tumors including laryngeal cancer [41] \nesophageal cancer [42]  stomach cancer [43]  lung cancer\n[44]  and thyroid cancer [45] \nMain differences between our report and previous\n\nones can be justified by techniques sensitivity  the diver-\nsity of populations  variations in sample size and the\nsemi-quantitative reading of immunostaining  Still  stud-\nies with broader panel of cases are certainly of great\nvalue for assessing the value of leptin immunostaining in\ndiagnoses and prognoses of breast malignancies \n\nConclusions\nLeptin immunostaining is a useful method in supporting\nthe diagnoses and prognoses of breast carcinoma  Our\nfindings proposes that leptin could be a helpful\nbiomarker in identifying the histotype  stage  grade \nrelapse and prognosis in BC  The association of leptin\nimmunostaining with many clinicopathological factors\nproposes a role of leptin in BC progression \n\nAbbreviations\nBC  Breast cancer  DCIS  Invasive ductal carcinoma  ER  Estrogen receptor \nHER2  Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  Ob  Obese gene \nPR

\ncancer\nGiovanni Battista Biserni1 · Enrico Di Oto1 · Linda Eszter Moskovszky2 · \nMaria Pia Foschini1 · Zsuzsanna Varga2  \n\nReceived  20 July 2017 / Accepted  1 November 2017 / Published online  7 November 2017 \n© The Author s  2017  This article is an open access publication\n\nConclusion We found a high sensitivity for all the mark-\ners analyzed  Moreover  the expression of NY-BR-1 and \nGATA-3 seemed the most effective for labelling male breast \ncancer in primary and metastatic setting \n\nKeywords NY-BR-1 · GATA-3 · Primary male breast \ncancer · Metastatic male breast cancer\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn metastatic cancer  the knowledge of the site of origin is a \nkey factor in patients’ management  Indeed  most of the ther-\napies available rely on tissue-specific features and tumoral \nmolecular characterization  On the other hand  the identifi-\ncation of the site of origin of a newly discovered metastatic \nadenocarcinoma  especially in case of poorly differentiated \ncancers  can represent a diagnostic dilemma  To identify \nthe site of the primary tumor  several immunohistochemi-\ncal approaches have been developed  Dennis et al  2005  \nRubin et al  2001  ideally  each is aiming to reach the best \nspecificity and sensitivity with the use of an ideal number \nof marker combination \n\nMale breast cancer is an uncommon disease  accounting \nfor   88–91% with the primary \ntumor  Jäger et al  2007  Varga et al  2006  Other markers of \nmammary differentiation such as GATA-3  mammaglobin  \nand BRST-2  or gross cystic disease fluid protein 15  have \nbeen successfully employed in female breast cancer  These \nmarkers exhibit prognostic and therapeutic implications  rep-\nresent important tools for detecting primary breast cancer \nand metastasis  and monitor lymph nodes during and after \nsurgery  Wang et al  2009  Kandalaft et al  2016  Yet  none \nof these markers has been sufficiently investigated in male \nbreast cancer \n\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the expression of \nfemale breast cancer established markers NY-BR-1  GATA-\n3  mammaglobin  and BRST-2 in a cohort of male breast \ncancer in primary and metastatic lesions \n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPatients’ cohort\n\nThirty consecutive cases of primary male breast cancer were \nretrieved from the Department of Surgical Pathology and \nMolecular Pathology  University Hospital  Zürich  Switzer-\nland  Paraffin embedded in formalin fixed tissues  FFPE  of \nthe primary tumor and of normal breast tissues were avail-\nable in all cases  In eight cases  axillary or distant metastases \n 7 to lymph nodes and 1 to the brain  were also available in \nFFPE blocks \n\nThe 30 male breast cancer cases consisted of 23 invasive \nductal carcinomas  no special type  NST  4 papillary intra-\ncystic  with foci of invasion  carcinomas  and 2 micropapil-\nlary and 1 tubulo-lobular carcinomas  Four of thirty cases \nwere grade 1  21 of 30 grade 2  and 5 of 30 grade 3  The \nmean age of the patients at surgery was 66  ranging from \n39 to 92  All patients underwent mastectomy and received \nno systemic chemotherapy prior to surgery  Regional lymph \nnodes metastases were present in seven cases  1 grade 1  4 \ngrade 2  and 2 grade 3  and distant metastasis to the brain \nin one case of grade 3 tumor \n\nEstrogen receptor  ER  and progesterone receptor  PR  \nwere re-assessed by immunohistochemistry  IHC  and Her2 \nstatus was detected with IHC and with fluorescent in situ \nhybridization  FISH \n\nTwenty-nine of thirty  96 6%  primary tumors were ER \npositive  and 26 of 30 cases  86 6%  PR positive  For ER  \nthe percentage of positive cells ranged from 5 to 100%  for \nPR  positive cells represented from 3% to 100% of the total \n\nOne of the 30 cases  3%  was Her2 positive  score \n3 + and FISH amplified \n\nLymph nodes and brain metastasis were always concord-\nant in asset of hormone receptors and Her2 status with the \nmatched primary tumors \n\nCase selection\n\nCases were included in this study when paraffin blocks were \navailable with adequate tissue to allow further analysis  \nHematoxylin–eosin  HE -stained slides of all cases were \nretrieved for histological evaluation  In case HE slides used \nfor diagnosis were unavailable  new sections have been pre-\npared  All male breast cancer cases underwent histological \nreview and were classified and graded according to currently \navailable criteria  Tavassoli and Eusebi 2009  Elston and \nEllis 2002  by an experienced pathologist  ZV  and the \nmost representative tumor blocks were selected for the study \n\nRepresentative HE sections are shown in Fig  1 \n\nTissue microarray  TMA  construction\n\nInvasive carcinomas both in the primary tumor and the meta-\nstatic deposits were identified on HE sections  In addition  \nareas of normal breast tissues were also selected on HE sec-\ntions  Two cores of 0 6 mm each were punched from each \narea and transferred to an empty paraffin block under the \nguidance of a precision tool \n\nImmunohistochemistry for NY‑BR‑1  GATA‑3  \nmammaglobin  and BRST‑2\n\nThe immunohistochemistry for NY-BR-1  GATA-3  mam-\nmaglobin  and BRST-2 have been conducted on the whole \ncohort with specific antibodies  Slides underwent pretreat-\nment with TRIS/BORAT/EDTA Buffer and subsequently \nwere treated with the antibodies on an automated bench-\nmark  Ventana  Roche  Tucson  AZ  USA  Table 1 shows  \nin detail  laboratory protocol used for each antibody \n\nTo assess each protein expression  the tissue cores were \nscored by two pathologists  GBB  ZV  according to the per-\ncentage of cells showing a successful staining  The stains \nwere acceptable as positive  if the internal control on the test \nbreast tissue slide  respectively  the normal breast glands on \nthe tissue cores were positive  The evaluation was conducted \nat least on 60 cells  alternatively on the maximal number \nassessable if less invasive tumor cells were available  Stain-\ning intensity was not considered  To classify each lesion as \neither positive or negative  the following scoring was made \n\nNY-BR-1  a tumor was considered positive  when at least \na cluster of carcinoma cells exhibited staining \nin the cytoplasm or in the nucleus  Varga et al  \n2006 \n\n\n\n201J Cancer Res Clin Oncol  2018  144 199–204 \n\n1 3\n\nGATA-3  a case containing more than 5% of stained nuclei \nwas considered positive for the expression of \nGATA-3  Wendroth et al  2015 \n\nMammaglobin and BRST-2  immuno-positivity was \nscored as follows  diffuse cytoplasmic staining in more \nthan 1% of the population \n\nConcordant expression between primary tumors and \nmatched metastasis was observed when both the lesions \nscored either positive or negative for the same marker \n\nStatistical analysis\n\nFisher’s exact test was performed on the differences of \nthe staining percentage of positive cases  a threshold of \np < 0 05 was considered to reflect significant differences \nbetween groups \n\nResults\n\nNY‑BR‑1\n\nAll 30 cases showed the expression of NY-BR-1 in pri-\nmary lesions and in all 8 metastases \n\nIn the primary tumors  sensitivity was 96 5% ranging \nfrom 90 to 100%  metastases showed 100% sensitivity in \nall the cases considered  and the expression was always \nconcordant in with the matched primary tumor \n\nGATA‑3\n\nAll 30 primary tumors stained positively for GATA-3  \nwhereas metastases were positive in six of eight cases  5 \nof 7 for lymph nodes and the brain metastasis

\nnodes and the brain metastasis  showed positive staining \nfor mammaglobin  sensitivity was 44 8% of the total  on \naverage  and ranged from 4 to 100%  Concordance between \nprimary and secondary lesion was observed in 7/8 cases \n\nBRST‑2\n\nEighteen of thirty  60%  primary tumors were positive for \nBRST-2  the sensitivity varied from 2 to 100% and was on \naverage 25 3%  Five of eight cases of corresponding metas-\ntasis were positive  4 of 7 to lymph nodes and the brain \nlesion  the sensitivity was 59%  ranging from 10 to 100  \nIn 4/8 cases  the expression of this marker was concordant \nbetween primary tumor and metastasis \n\nResults are summarized in Table 2 and representative \nimmunohistochemistry stains are also shown in Fig  1 \n\nStatistical analysis\n\nDifferences in staining percentage were not significant with \nFisher’s exact test \n\nDiscussion\n\nAs male breast cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced \nstage  breast origin must be taken into account in case of \nnewly discovered metastatic adenocarcinomas  In this study  \nwe could show that immunohistochemical profile of the so-\ncalled breast markers can be reliably applied also to male \nbreast cancer both in the primary and in the metastatic \nsettings \n\nIn this study  we observed a high sensitivity for all known \nfemale breast markers in a cohort of male breast cancer and \nin their corresponding axillary and/or distant metastases  \n\nAmong the markers  NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 showed the \nhighest expression \n\nNY-BR-1 is frequently expressed in normal breast  female \nbreast cancer  and metastasis  whilst no significant expres-\nsion has been detected in any other normal or neoplastic \ntissue  Varga et al  2006  The highest sensitivity rate for \nNY-BR-1 was observed in normal glandular breast tissue and \nin ductal carcinoma in situ in females  Varga et al  2006  \nInvasive female breast carcinomas were shown to express \nNY-BR-1 depending on histological grading  being mostly \nexpressed in G1 and G2 carcinomas  Varga et al  2006  \nTherefore  NY-BR-1 is considered both as a breast-specific \nmarker and as a differentiation marker as well  Varga et al  \n2006  Since our cohort comprised a significant number of \ngrade 1 and 2 primary tumors  25/30  and metastases came \nmainly from neoplasms of the same grade of differentiation \n 5/8  positive cases for NY-BR-1 were likely to represent \nthe vast majority in this study  As NY-BR-1 was shown to \nbe inversely related to breast differentiation  problems may \narise in clinical practice when considering distant metas-\ntasis from a poorly differentiated carcinoma  Assumed the \npeculiar specificity of NY-BR-1  it is to emphasize that \nhigh-grade lesions may lose the expression of the protein \nmore frequently than reported in the present study  Neverthe-\nless  the concordance highlighted between metastases and \nmatched primary tumors  100%  encourages the application \nof this marker also in metastatic setting \n\nGATA-3 is a protein linked to estrogen receptor path-\nway  It is not surprising that we found a high prevalence of \npositive cases in a group with 96 6% of ER + tumors  Male \nbreast cancer is expected to be ER + in a higher percentage \nof case rather than female breast cancer  Doebar et al  2017 \n\nThe role of GATA-3 has been extensively investigated in \nfemale breast pathology \n\nSangoi et al  compared the sensitivity of GATA-3 to \nmammaglobin and GCDFP-15  BRST-2  and found that \nGATA-3 showed superior sensitivity in both metastatic \ncarcinoma and matched primary tumor  Moreover  IHC for \nGATA-3 harbored consistently fewer problems of interpreta-\ntion  thanks to less background staining  than the other two \nmarkers  Sangoi et al  2016 \n\nIn our subset of carcinomas  we observed the same ten-\ndency  The sensitivity of mammaglobin vs GATA-3 in label-\nling male breast cancer was 73 3 vs 100%  and BRST-2 vs \n\nTable 2  Sensitivity of breast \nmarkers in concordant primary \ntumors and matched metastases  \nin brackets  percentage of the \ntotal\n\nEach is referred to the marker of the

60 vs 100%  respectively  Expression in metas-\ntases showed similar levels of concordance  75% for both \nGATA-3 and mammaglobin  and 62 5% for BRST-2 \n\nAlthough GATA-3 has been reported to be highly sensi-\ntive for breast tumors  it is not entirely specific  Commonly  \nGATA-3 expression characterizes tumors arising from skin \nadnexa  urothelium  salivary glands  and pancreatic ducts  \nwhereas adenocarcinomas of lung  stomach  colon  and \nprostate showed positivity to a lesser extent  Miettinen et al  \n2014 \n\nTo avoid clinical concerns arising from the lack of speci-\nficity of GATA-3 in the setting of metastatic adenocarci-\nnoma  we carried further analysis on the same cohort with \nthe novel marker NY-BR-1  which showed a high concord-\nance between GATA-3 and NY-BR-1 \n\nMammaglobin  is a protein of unknown function  whose \nexpression increases tenfold in breast cancer  Watson and \nFleming 1996  It has not been detected in any other type \nof cancer  whereas in small amounts only in normal breast \ntissue \n\nThe discovery of its specificity brought to employ this \nprotein for labelling breast neoplasms  The expression varies \nbetween different subtypes  high in luminal and Her2 posi-\ntive tumors and rather low in triple negative and basal-like \ntumors  Mammaglobin raised sensitivity and specificity in \ndistinguishing between cutaneous metastases of breast carci-\nnomas and sweat gland carcinomas  Lewis et al  2011  Diel \net al  1996  Other studies conducted with RT-PCR analysis \nreported mammaglobin utility in monitoring lymph nodes  \npredicting the risk of metastases  and characterizing pleural \neffusions in breast cancer patients  Ciampa et al  2004 \n\nHowever  given its high specificity  IHC for mamma-\nglobin in our study showed a sensitivity of 73 3%  These \ndata make this marker only partially suitable for labelling \nmale lesions  if adopted on its own \n\nBRST-2  also known as gross cystic disease fluid protein \nGCDFP-15  is a breast marker expressed in up to 73% of \nfemale breast cancer  Fritzsche et al  2007  His detection \nin specimens is clearly influenced by the histological and \nmolecular subtype  sensitivity is high in tumors with apo-\ncrine and lobular signet ring features  as well as androgen \nreceptor positivity which is also related to BRST-2 expres-\nsion  On the other hand  medullary histological phenotype \nand triple negative intrinsic subtype showed lower rates of \nBRST-2 positivity \n\nSimilar to GATA-3  this marker does not exclusively label \nbreast cancer  it is expressed by apocrine glands  including \nthose in the breast  the tracheobronchial tree  sweat gland \ncarcinomas  and salivary gland carcinomas  Wick et al  \n1998  Finally  an important overlap is observed in 5–6% of \nlung adenocarcinomas  In our cohort  we found that 60% of \nmale breast cancer scored positive for BRST-2  enhancing a \nsubstantial lack of sensitivity \n\nEither in female or in male breast cancer  BRST-2 and \nmammaglobin may show a clinical value only when com-\nbined with other markers  In our study  we could show \nthat NY-BR-1 possesses greater sensitivity than both the \naforementioned markers \n\nIn the setting of metastases of unknown origin  there are \nestablished immunohistochemical panels to apply  In case \nclinical history  complete physical examination  routine \nlaboratory tests  imaging  and radio-metabolic techniques \ndo not come to any conclusive results  the detection of \ntumor specific antigens or specific immunohistochemical \nstains can be also helpful \n\nFor a subset of tumors  one marker alone may show the \nsufficient diagnostic accuracy \n\nIn appropriate clinical context  the prostate-specific \nantigen  PSA  for prostate cancer  PAX8 for ovarian can-\ncer  alphafetoprotein for liver cancer  and TTF1 for lung \ncancer can be reliably used as a single marker  Dennis \net al  2005  Rubin et al  2001  Woodard et al  2011 \n\nIf one marker alone does not possess sufficient specific-\nity nor sensitivity for the suspected neoplasms  a combina-\ntion of IHC stains may provide additional support  An ini-\ntial approach with cytokeratin subtypes as CK7 and CK20 \ngives a first hint at the likely site of origin for carcinomas \nas to gastrointestinal or gynecological origin  These tests \ncan be completed with CDX2 and CK19 for upper gastro-\nintestinal tract  biliary ducts and pancreas  thyroglobulin \nfor thyroid adenocarcinoma  NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 for \nfemale breast cancer  Mel-A  S100 and HMB45 for mela-\nnoma  and vimentin and Mel-A for kidney and adrenal \ngland tumors \n\nIn our study we could show that NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 \nare highly sensitive breast markers in primary and meta-\nstatic male breast cancer  As already demonstrated in \nfemales  both NY-BR-1 and GATA-3 expression in male \nbreast cancer outperforms the use of mammaglobin and \nBRST-2 alone  Using either NY-BR-1 or GATA-3  rather \nthan mammaglobin and BRST-2 may help confirming \nbreast origin both in primary and in metastatic carcinoma \nin males \n\nCompliance with ethical standards \n\nFunding No funding was necessary for

in drug-treated and control samples and is seriously confounded by unequal\ndivision rates arising from natural biological variation and differences in culture conditions  This problem\ncan be overcome by computing drug sensitivity on a per-division basis  The normalized growth rate\ninhibition  GR  approach yields per-division metrics for drug potency  GR50  and efﬁcacy  GRmax  that are\nanalogous to the more familiar IC50 and Emax values  In this work  we report GR-based  proliferation-\ncorrected  drug sensitivity metrics for ~4 700 pairs of breast cancer cell lines and perturbagens  Such data\nare broadly useful in understanding the molecular basis of therapeutic response and resistance  Here  we\nuse them to investigate the relationship between different measures of drug sensitivity and conclude that\ndrug potency and efﬁcacy exhibit high variation that is only weakly correlated  To facilitate further use of\nthese data  computed GR curves and metrics can be

Summary\nThe prioritization of compounds for lead discovery  identiﬁcation of pharmacogenomic associations  and\nstudy of cellular machinery requires reproducible and accurate data on drug response in cultured cell\nlines  In the case of anti-cancer drugs  which act by slowing cell proliferation or increasing the rate of cell\ndeath  the traditional approach is to expose cells to a drug over a range of concentrations  measure the\nnumber of cells at the end of a ﬁxed period of time  typically 3 days  and then compare that number to\nthe number of cells in a vehicle-only control  The ratios are usually ﬁtted to a sigmoidal curve from which\nit is possible to compute IC50  the drug concentration at which cell count is half the control value  which\nis a traditional measure of potency  and Emax  the maximum effect at the highest concentration tested \nwhich is a measure of efﬁcacy  Although in use for many decades  this calculation is sensitive to the\nnumber of cell divisions taking place over the course of the assay  which differ when cell division rates\nvary  As a consequence  it is possible for IC50 values for a single drug in a single cell line to vary 100-fold\nor more simply as a consequence of exogenously imposed changes in the rate of division1 2  Natural cell\ndivision rates vary from one cell line to the next  often in a systematic manner depending on tissue of\norigin2 3  media composition  culture conditions  and plating density1  Because division rate is a powerful\nconfounder in the calculation of IC50 and Emax values  and because it is often poorly controlled  we\nspeculate that it is a contributor to the observed irreproducibility of drug dose-response data2–5 \n\nThe normalized growth rate inhibition  GR  method recently introduced by Hafner et al 1 2 corrects\nfor variation in division rates by estimating the magnitude of drug response on a per-division basis  The\nGR value in the presence of drug at concentration c is GR c = 2k c /k 0 − 1 where k c  is the growth rate of\ndrug-treated cells and k 0  is the growth rate of untreated control cells  Growth rates can be estimated\nusing time course data or  as in this paper  the number of cells prior to and at a ﬁxed time after the\naddition of drug  Metrics of drug potency  GR50  and efﬁcacy  GRmax  can then be calculated from the\ndose-response curve  The sign of the GR value is related directly to response phenotype  negative values\nreﬂect cytotoxicity  a value of 0 corresponds to complete cystostasis  and positive values reﬂect partial\ngrowth inhibition  GR calculations are described in detail at http //www GRbrowser org/  and a detailed\nmethod for performing the calculations with web-based software and an R pipeline is also available6 7 \n\nThe datasets presented here make use of drug dose-response data that have been described\npreviously8 9 as well as substantial new data and comprise  after ﬁltering low-quality data points  GR-\nbased dose-response data for 71 breast cancer cell lines from all three major subtypes of breast cancer\n HER2 ampliﬁed  hormone receptor positive  and triple negative  and 107 perturbagens  104 small\nmolecule drugs and 3 therapeutic antibodies  We found that low growth was a good criterion for ﬁltering\nout data with high relative error  as judged by standard error of the mean  SEM  for GR values \npresumably because   a  a very low division rate  fewer than one division per 72 h  is an indicator that the\nexperimental setup is not optimized for the growth of a particular cell line   b  ﬁxed error in Cell Titer-\nGlo  CTG  assays makes measurement of smaller differences in cell number between control and\nexperimental samples unreliable  and  c  partial cell cycle synchronization introduced during plating of\ncells with division times longer than the assay duration violates the assumption in GR calculations that\ngrowth is homogenous and constant10  As a quality control ﬁlter  we therefore eliminated from further\nconsideration all samples in which the vehicle-only controls underwent too few divisions  Despite the\nneed to ﬁlter out some data  the 4 700 unique cell line/perturbagen pairs described in this paper represent\none of the largest collections of growth-corrected drug-response measurements currently available \n\nMethods\nCell culture and treatment\nThe original dataset [DS0  Data Citation 1] comprised the effects of 139 perturbagens  small molecules\nand therapeutic antibodies  on 73 breast cancer cell lines  some in multiple cell growth conditions \ndetermined by plating cells at a density such that they remained in logarithmic growth during the assay11 \nThis required adjusting passage and plating conditions for each line \n\nCells were allowed to attach overnight onto 96-well plates before being treated in technical triplicate\nfor 72 h with nine doses of each perturbagen in a 1 5 serial dilution  The concentration range was\noptimized on six cell lines  and  for most cell line/perturbagen pairs  the highest concentration tested fell\nbetween 33 μM and 167 μM \n\nCell count\nCell count was estimated using the Cell Titer-Glo  CTG  Luminescent Cell Viability Assay  Promega \nafter three days in drug  the endpoint of the assay  Cell count was also measured in untreated plates at\nthe time of treatment  The raw CTG assay readout values were considered proportional to the number of\nviable cells and used as surrogates for cell count values  which is a widely used assumption with some\ncaveats12  A background CTG value was obtained from wells containing culture medium but no cells\n values between 35 and 250  Dataset DS0 [Data Citation 1] comprises all raw CTG values \n\nCell count normalization and GR values\nDataset DS1 [Data

between –1 and 1  negative values correspond to a cytotoxic response  i e  cell death  a\nvalue of 0 corresponds to a fully cytostatic response  no increase or decrease in cell number  and\npositive values less than one correspond to partial growth inhibition  GRmax can only be compared\nacross drugs or cell lines when the highest tested doses are the same \n\n● GRAOC  the integrated effect of the drug across a range of concentrations as estimated from the ‘area\nover the curve’  A value of 0 means no effect of the drug across the full dose-response range  GRAOC\ncan only be compared across drugs or cell lines when the dose range is the same \n\n● GRinf  a measure of drug efﬁcacy extrapolated to an inﬁnitely high drug concentration as determined\nfrom the asymptote of the dose-response curve  GRinf  GRðc-1Þ  For dose-response curves that\nreach a plateau under experimental conditions  the value of GRinf is similar to GRmax \n\n● hGR  the Hill coefﬁcient of the ﬁtted curve  it reﬂects the steepness of the dose-response curve  We\nconstrained its value between 0 1 and 5 \n\n● GEC50  an analogy to EC50 corresponding to the concentration of drug at half-maximal effect  GEC50\nis relevant for drugs that have poor potency and that do not reach a GR value below 0 5  In the ﬁtting\nprocedure  GEC50 is constrained to lie within two orders of magnitude of the highest and lowest\ntested drug concentrations \n\nWe excluded from further consideration cell line/perturbagen pairs in which fewer than 0 3 cell\ndivisions  a 23% increase in cell number  were recorded for the no-treatment control over the course of a\n3-day assay  this affected 8 5% of the data  the majority of which were associated with 6 speciﬁc cell lines \nThis was done because GR values quantify the effects of drugs on cell growth  If untreated control\ncultures are not growing  the response to drug is generally weak  and GR values become highly variable\nand biologically meaningless  In principle  it is possible to quantify the effects of highly cytotoxic drugs\nunder these conditions using traditional Emax values  but fewer than 1% of the responses in the overall\ndataset were sufﬁciently cytotoxic that Emax values would not have been biased by the low division rate \nFollowing ﬁltering  we obtained 4 788 unique cell line/perturbagen pairs  the majority of which were\nrecorded in biological duplicate for a total of 8 882 cell line/perturbagen pairs  each tested at nine doses in\ntechnical triplicate  Before averaging biological replicates when available  we further ﬁltered the data to\nexclude measurements for which division time was greater than 80 h  corresponding to 0 9 division over\nthe course of a 72 h assay  We included this cutoff based on preliminary data showing that GR values\nobtained from slow-growing cell lines had high uncertainty  see Technical Validation section below  The\n\nwww nature com/sdata/\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 4 170166

the code\nhas been validated on multiple datasets  Use and installation instructions  as well as bug ﬁxes  are\navailable at our GitHub repo  https //github com/datarail/gr_metrics  Methods for plating cells  adding\ndrugs  and performing CTG assays have also been described in Heiser et al 8 and elsewhere  We have\nrecently published an in-depth protocol10 for performing drug dose-response experiments in cell lines\nthat includes advances in methodology not available at the time the current data were collected  We\nrecommend that future studies follow these more recent guidelines \n\nOne of the key biological premises implicit in computing GR metrics is that cells in untreated wells\nare proliferating in a uniform  exponential  and continuous manner  In principle  this should be true\nfor all established cell lines  but in a large-scale drug-response experiment it is inevitable that some\nvariability will be encountered  For this reason  we discarded any plate in which control cells underwent\nfewer than 0 3 cell divisions  When we examined cell line/perturbagen pairs in which cells had undergone\nmore than 0 9 divisions in the absence of drug  we observed a substantially lower standard error of\nthe mean  SEM  Fig  1  The 95th-percentile SEM was 0 35 for all cell line pairs tested and dropped\nto ~0 30 when we removed the 27% of the conditions that represent the slowest growing conditions\n fewer than 0 9 divisions  We suspect that this arises because ratios between x c  xctrl  and x0 are\nmore sensitive to ﬁxed measurement noise in the case of slow growing cultures  Low division number\ncan arise because some cells are inherently slow growing  but sporadic examples of slow growth are\nmore likely to reﬂect defects in the plate  excess evaporation of the medium  or pipetting error \nRegardless  eliminating data for these slow growing conditions improved the SEM of the GR values and\nmetrics \n\nThe SEM of the GR values was below 0 1 for 75% of the data in dataset DS1  but 10% of the conditions\nin DS1 remained substantially variable across replicates  SEM > 0 2  Among the GR values with SEM >\n\nFigure 2  Relationship between

little bias by cell line  We therefore concluded that the data were impacted primarily by\nsporadic rather than systematic error  see Methods  With respect to estimation of drug potency  the SEM\nfor GR50 across all perturbagens and cell lines was low  SEM below half an order of magnitude in drug\nconcentration for 95% of the cell line/perturbagen pairs  but this estimate is biased by the many cases in\nwhich cells are resistant for which GR50 is set at inﬁnity  For the subset of cell line/perturbagen pairs in\nwhich a substantial biological response is observed  GR50 o10 μM  77% of the data have SEM values\n\nFigure 3  Distribution of the GR metrics by drug for all analyzed cell lines  averaged across biological\n\nreplicates   a  GR50 values   b  GRmax values   c  GRAOC   d  Hill

below an order\nof magnitude for 75% of the cell line/perturbagen pairs  Overall  the sigmoidal ﬁt was good  r2>0 75  for\n90% of the cell line/perturbagen pairs that show a substantial biological response  GRmaxo0 5  Taken\ntogether  these results show that  for this dataset  differences in GR value above 0 2 or in GR50 values\nabove half an order of magnitude should reﬂect substantial differences in sensitivity \n\nUsage Notes\nUses of our data include identifying cell lines or subtypes that are particularly sensitive or resistant to a\nclass of drugs  or the converse  for follow-up investigation  Using GR metrics for systematic\npharmacogenomics studies has two advantages relative to standard approaches2   1  it ensures that\nenrichment analysis is not biased by differences in division rate  and  2  it makes it possible to distinguish\ngenes associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity  negative GRmax values  from cytostasis  GRmax values\nbetween 0 and 1  In the current study  we ﬁrst compared potency  as measured by GR50 values  and\nefﬁcacy  as measured by GRmax values  by drug class across cell lines  see Table 1  available online only \nfor annotations  Fig  2 and DS3 [Data Citation 2]  This showed that drugs targeting tubulin and the\nproteasome are among the most potent  low GR50  whereas HDAC inhibitors and DNA cross-linkers\nhave the highest efﬁcacy  low GRmax  Many drugs induced a cytotoxic response at the highest\nconcentrations  negative GRmax values  but most MAPK inhibitors and the majority of the ErbB  PI3K \nand RTK inhibitors had positive GRmax values  showing that such drugs are partially cytostatic in most\nbreast cancer cell lines  When results were sorted by clinical subtype  we found  for example  that tubulin-\nbinding drugs were generally less efﬁcacious in non-malignant  NM  and hormone-receptor-positive cell\nlines  HR+  than in HER2-ampliﬁed  HER2amp  and triple-negative  TNBC  cells  such drugs are used\nmost widely in the treatment of TNBC \n\nContemporary analysis of tool compounds and therapeutic drugs focuses almost entirely on\ncomparing differences in drug potency  with relatively little attention paid to efﬁcacy as measured by\nmaximum drug effect  We have previously shown  however  that both IC50 and Emax values for the Heiser\n\nFigure 4  Distribution of the GR

dataset and GR-based drug metrics described in this work  we came to the same conclusion \nnamely that values for GR50  GRmax  GRAOC  and hGR are variable across cell lines and drugs  Fig  3  For\nsome drugs  predominantly MAPK and ErbB inhibitors  GR50 and GRmax values were correlated  but\nfurther analysis showed that this arose simply because a few cell lines were drug sensitive whereas the\nmajority were resistant  When we examined the subset of cell line/perturbagen pairs that resulted in\ncytotoxicity  GRmaxo0  we observed no correlation between GR50 and GRmax  Spearman’s p > 0 05 \n\nAggregating drugs by class  based on nominal targets–see Table 1  available online only  for these\nannotations  Fig  4 and DS4 [Data Citation 2]  also revealed systematic variation in efﬁcacy  potency  and\nHill coefﬁcient by drug class  For example  GR50 values for tubulin-binding drugs are very similar across\ncell lines  variation in response primarily involves GRmax values  many of which are negative  Figs 3a b and\n4a b  mTOR and PI3K inhibitors as a class have very shallow dose-response curves characterized by low\nHill coefﬁcients  hGR  Figs 3d and 4d  and positive GRmax values  reﬂecting partial growth inhibition  Area\nover the dose-response curve  GRAOC  Figs 3c and 4c  can also be used to assess drug potency and efﬁcacy\nin a single metric  but we have shown that GRAOC values have lower information content than GR50 and\nGRmax values taken jointly\n\n2 because the latter two are biologically different  We therefore propose that\nfuture studies of cellular factors  genetic changes  and epigenomic variants controlling the responsiveness\nof cells to anti-cancer drugs consider associations with GR50  GRmax  and hGR independently \n\nReferences\n1  Hafner

treatment at\nof readmission included IVIg and steroid pulse  thus  we\nt completely exclude the inﬂuence of these medical and\ntreatments on the improvement in physical and cognitive\ns andADL However  muscle strength improved after the\n\n\n\n\nﬁrst admission and readmission  and BBS and FIM improved\ndespite no changes in SARA during readmission  We believe that\nthose were the results of

muscle\nstrength can improve independent of the course of cerebellar\nsymptoms  Therefore  in conjunction with early oncotherapy  it\nis important to continue rehabilitation according to the

declines in cognitive function have been indicated \nthus  awareness of this issue while implementing rehabilitation\nis also important \n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Editage  www

Approximately 89% of\nith BC survive at least 5 years after treatment  but the\n\ncts can persist for months or years [2] Early and late\nical consequences  mainly on the upper limb  are

was found in 6  2 3% \npatients  The patients received IORT in Taiwan differed markedly from those used in the\nELIOT and TARGIT-A studies  Specifically  patients selected for IORT in Taiwan tended to\nbe younger  their tumors tended to be larger and the prevalence of lymph node metastasis\ntended to be lower  Among these 261 patients  8  3 1%  patients required whole breast\nradiotherapy  During a mean follow up of 15 6 months  locoregional recurrence was\nobserved in 2  0 8%  patients \n\nConclusion\nIn real world experience  patients received IORT differed quite significantly with criteria for-\nmulated by trials  The preliminary results of IORT in Taiwan showed it is well acceptable by\npatients and clinicians \n\nIntroduction\nBreast conserving surgery  BCS  followed by whole-breast external beam radiotherapy\n\n WBRT  has become the mainstay of surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer [1  2] \n\nWBRT reduces the likelihood of local recurrence in the conserved breast and lowers the risk of\n\ndeath due to breast cancer [3]  However  conventional WBRT  which is administered daily\n\nover a 6- to 7-week period  precludes a significant proportion of women from receiving the\n\nfull course of radiation treatment [4–6]  Intraoperative radiotherapy  IORT  in which postop-\n\nerative whole-breast irradiation is substituted for one session of radiotherapy with the same\n\nequivalent dose during surgery  solves this problem by allowing for treatment to be completed\n\non the same day  Recent trials such as electron intraoperative radiotherapy versus external\n\nradiotherapy for early breast cancer  ELIOT trial  [7] and targeted intraoperative radiotherapy\n\nversus whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer  TARGIT-A trial  [8  9] have demonstrated\n\nthat IORT in some selected groups of low-risk early breast cancer patients results in acceptable\n\noutcomes and could  therefore  serve as an alternative to conventional WBRT \n\nIORT using the Axxent electronic brachytherapy  eBX  system  Xoft  Inc  San Jose  CA \n\nfor the treatment of breast cancer is a relative new method of delivering accelerated partial\n\nbreast irradiation  APBI  that aims to replace WBRT in selected women suitable for BCS  The\n\none-year results of a trial utilizing eBX to deliver 5-day APBI treatment have shown it to be an\n\neffective alternative method with minimal acute side-effects [10]  Another single-institution\n\ntrial also found that delivery of IORT via the eBX system was efficacious and safe for women\n\nwith early-stage breast cancer [11] \n\nThe Xoft IORT using the Axxent electronic brachytherapy  eBX  system was introduced for\n\nthe treatment of breast cancer in Taiwan in May of 2012  The Taiwan IORT study cooperative\n\ngroup  T-IORTSCG  was established to monitor the effectiveness of and clinical outcomes\n\nassociated with the Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 IORT delivery system for the management of early-\n\nstage breast cancer in Taiwan  In this multi-center study  we report the patient selection crite-\n\nria for and preliminary oncologic outcomes associated with this new type of radiotherapy \n\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nIn this study  we collected clinicopathologic data from the T-IORTSCG database on patients\n\nwho underwent IORT for breast cancer during the period January 2013 to December 2015 at\n\nIORT for breast cancer in Taiwan\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0185876 November 2  2017 2 / 13\n\nfunding provided by the Changhua

collected from the database\n\nincluded patient characteristics  type of surgery  type and dose of IORT  recurrence  and sur-\n\nvival status at the most recent follow-up  The data gathered from the database covered more\n\nthan 95% of the IORT procedures performed in Taiwan during the study period and therefore\n\ncan be interpreted as representing the status of IORT in Taiwan  All data were collected by\n\nchart review by a specially trained nurse and confirmed by the principle investigator  HWL \n\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Changhua Christian Hospital\n\n CCH IRB No  151004  Due to the retrospective and chart review nature of this study  the\n\nethics committees  IRB  in our hospital decided no written or verbal informed consent was\n\nneeded by the participants  Patient records/information was anonymized and de-identified\n\nprior to analysis \n\nPatient selection for IORT\nA preoperative tissue diagnosis of cancer of the breast was required prior to the operation \n\nPre-operative mammography and sonography were used in all patients to determine their eli-\n\ngibility for IORT  Magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  was used optionally for selection of\n\npatients’ suitability for IORT  Liver sonography  chest X ray  and whole body bone scan were\n\nused in all patients to exclude the possibility of distant metastasis \n\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on those reported previously [7–9  11–14] \n\nThe inclusion criteria for patients suitable for IORT were unifocal tumors of less than 3 cm  no\n\nevidence of lymph node involvement  the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma  IDC  or duc-\n\ntal carcinoma in situ  DCIS  and a minimum age of 45 years  Contraindications for IORT\n\nincluded inflammatory breast cancer  breast cancer with chest wall or skin invasion  locally\n\nadvanced breast cancer  breast cancer with extensive axillary lymph node metastasis  stage\n\nIIIA or later  and severe co-morbid conditions such as heart disease  renal failure  liver dys-\n\nfunction  or poor performance status as assessed by primary care physicians  All patients\n\nunderwent extensive preoperative counseling by the surgeon and the radiation oncologist \n\nRadiation treatment options were explained to the patients  including standard WBRT as well\n\nas IORT \n\nSurgical treatment and eBX IORT procedures\nThe protocol for carrying out IORT via the Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 delivery system is described\n\nin detail by Ivanov et al  [11]  and illustrated in Fig 1  In brief  sentinel lymph node biopsy\n\n SLNB  [15] was usually done first  Then BCS was performed  and intra-operative frozen sec-\n\ntion for margin status analysis was not mandatory  After excision of the tumor and a margin of\n\nhealthy tissue  breast tissue dissection was carried down to the level of the pectoralis fascia in\n\npreparation for IORT  The tumor bed was mobilized to ensure that there was a distance of at\n\nleast 10 mm between the surface of the applicator and the skin in order to reduce the risk of\n\nradionecrosis  Fig 1  The radiation source was inserted into the balloon and radiation therapy\n\nwas initiated  A planned dose of 20 Gy to the balloon surface was delivered over an average of\n\n8–15 mins  After radiation treatment  the retention sutures  the eBX balloon and the lead\n\nshield were removed  The lumpectomy cavity was irrigated and closed in a standard manner\n\nor an oncoplastic technique was performed to prevent parenchyma defects [16  17] \n\nPost-operative systemic therapy and follow-up\nPostoperative adjuvant hormone therapy  chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given to\n\npatients according to current breast cancer treatment guidelines [18  19]  The rate of positive\n\nsurgical margin involvement  locoregional recurrence  distant metastasis  and mortality were\n\nIORT for breast cancer in Taiwan\n\nPLOS ONE |

Xoft Axxent® eBx®\ndelivery system   a  The eBX system consists of a balloon applicator  a 50-kV source  and a mobile  highly\nportable controller unit that can be easily transported to any treatment room or standard operating room   b \nThe chest wall shield was placed temporarily into the cavity for the duration of radiation treatment to protect\nthe underlying heart  ribs  and lungs from scattered radiation   c  A balloon-like cavity evaluation device was\nthen placed through a lateral stab wound incision or directly into the wound and filled to a desired volume of\n30–75 cc  based on the radiation treatment plan   d  Once the cavity volume was determined  an appropriate\nsize of eBX balloon was opened up and inserted into the cavity  Multiple retention-type sutures were used to\nmaintain the balloon-to-tissue apposition and to temporarily close the lumpectomy cavity around the balloon \n e  Balloon-to-tissue conformity was assessed by intraoperative ultrasonography to ensure that the target\nvolume did not contain air or fluid  Intraoperative ultrasonography was then used to confirm that there was a\ndistance of at least 1 cm between the balloon and skin to reduce the risk of radionecrosis   f  A FlexiShieldTM\n FS  Xoft  Inc  San Jose  CA  was placed over the breast to minimize transmission of radiation to the patient\nand hospital staff   g  The radiation source was inserted into the balloon and radiation therapy was initiated  A\nplanned dose of 20 Gy to the balloon surface was delivered over an average of 8–15 mins   h  During\ntreatment  the surgeon

might be reasonable that\n\nincorporating MRI into pre-operative screening could reduce the possibility of enroll “occult\n\nmulti-focal or multicentric breast cancer patients” [25]  and therefore decrease the early\n\n“recurrence” \n\nIn our study  8 3 1%  patients who received IORT via the Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 system\n\nrequired WBRT  Three of them due to positive lymph node metastasis  one due to local recur-\n\nrence  and the other four due to positive surgical margin  Fig 2  In the TARGIT-A trial  15 2%\n\nof patients required supplemental WBRT after TARGIT [8]  As the concept of risk adapted\n\nIORT  it is recommended that supplemental WBRT be administered to patients who present\n\nwith tumor-free margins smaller than 1 mm  extensive in-situ components  or unexpected\n\ninvasive lobular carcinoma [8] \n\nIn the current study we investigated the indications for and clinical outcomes associated\n\nwith the delivery of IORT via the Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 IORT system in patients with primary\n\noperable breast cancer at medical centers in Taiwan during the period of 2013–2015  Our anal-\n\nysis revealed that the selection criteria used by the participating hospitals in this study differed\n\nmarkedly from those used in the ELIOT and TARGIT-A studies  Specifically  patients selected\n\nfor IORT in Taiwan tended to be younger  their tumors tended to be larger and the prevalence\n\nof lymph node metastasis tended to be lower  Limitations in this study include its retrospective\n\nnature and possible selection bias  The lack of long-term follow-up results in the current study\n\nprecluded us from determining whether the Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 system results in adequate\n\nlocal disease control  However  current study did provide important information for patients\n\nreceiving IORT with Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 system in a real world experience  which was\n\nderived from a national population based database \n\nIn conclusion  the Xoft Axxent1 eBx1 system is well-accepted by physicians and patients\n\nin Taiwan  The characteristics of patients selection in our study might reflected the need of\n\npatients desired for IORT  Our findings together with those from previous studies should help\n\nto delineate the role and value of this new adjuvant radiotherapy technique in the field of\n\nbreast cancer \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  Detailed patient

clinical benefits in terms of tumor biology as well as early\ndetection \n\nIntroduction\nThe goal of cancer screening is early tumor detection  followed by appropriate treatment  Reg-\n\nular screening mammography for breast cancer has been widely recommended and is sup-\n\nported by solid evidence  most population-based randomized controlled trials have reported\n\nreduced mortality among women who undergo screening mammography [1–5]  As in other\n\ndeveloped countries  a national health screening program in the Republic of Korea initiated a\n\npopulation-based mammography screening program in 1999 [6] \n\nBreast tumors detected by mammography screening are known to be smaller than those\n\ndetected outside of screening [7–11]  accordingly  better prognosis is largely observed in popu-\n\nlations wherein cancer is detected through screening programs  Of note  studies have also\n\nshown that mammographic cancer detection is associated with a better prognosis than that of\n\nsimilarly sized tumors found outside of screening [7–9 11–17]  These studies suggest that\n\nbreast screening itself could be considered a favorable prognostic variable independent of the\n\nprimary tumor size  axillary metastasis  age at cancer diagnosis  and tumor grade  Additionally \n\neven among patients with ductal carcinoma in situ  DCIS  those with screening-detected\n\ntumors had better outcomes than did those with symptom-detected tumors [18] \n\nIn this study  we investigated whether adherence to a breast screening program would yield\n\nclinical benefit even among patients with small invasive breast cancers  as outcomes might be\n\nless affected by the detection method  We compared the pathological and biological differ-\n\nences  including the proportions of immunohistochemistry  IHC -based subtypes  between\n\ngroups of patients who did and did not adhere to a screening program \n\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe institutional review board of Gangnam Severance Hospital  Yonsei University  Seoul \n\nKorea  approved this study  which was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice\n\nguidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki  The need for informed consent was waived because\n\nof the retrospective design  under the approval of the institutional review board  Patients with\n\nT1 breast cancer who were treated at Gangnam Severance Hospital between January 2006 and\n\nJune 2014 were identified  We excluded patients with bilateral breast cancer and those who\n\nwere treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy  Women younger than age 40 years were also\n\nexcluded because general population screening was recommended from age 40 years  Raw\n\ndata of these patients is provided online  S1 Data \n\nTumor detection method\nPhysicians in the Breast Cancer Center of Gangnam Severance Hospital interviewed patients\n\nand documented information about the tumor detection method in the medical charts  Adher-\n\nence to the breast screening program was defined as the completion of breast screening exami-\n\nnations within 3 years prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer because the Korean national\n\nhealth screening program offers biennial mammography screening  The completion of private\n\nmammography was also considered adherence to the breast screening program

screen-\n\nadherent  non-adherent  and unclassified  respectively  We further compared the clinical and\n\npathological characteristics between the adherent and non-adherent groups  Table 1  Patients\n\nwho adhered to the breast screening were more likely to have smaller tumors  P< 0 001  than\nwere the non-adherent patients  Although 490 patients  77 5%  had node-negative disease  the\n\nnon-adherent group was more likely to have a higher nodal stage  P = 0 004  The non-adher-\nent patients had more advanced stage disease  P< 0 001  higher histologic grade  P< 0 001 \nhigher ER-negative rate  P = 0 040  and higher HER2 positive rate  P = 0 026  Regarding\nadjuvant treatments  the adherent group was more likely to receive breast-conserving surgery\n\n P< 0 001  and endocrine therapy  P = 0 007  and less likely to receive chemotherapy\n P< 0 001 \n\nMoreover  we described our two groups in relation to the presence of symptoms  S1 Fig \n\nAll of the non-adherent had positive symptoms  while 161  35 8%  of the adherent had positive\n\nsymptoms  Details of symptoms in relation to the screening-adherence were presented in S1\n\nTable \n\nComparisons for IHC-based subtypes\nIn intergroup comparisons of IHC-based subtype frequencies  the adherent group had more\n\nfavorable subtypes compared to the non-adherent group  with a greater percentage of Lumi-\n\nnal/HER2-negative subtype  66 7% vs  56 5%  and a lower percentage of HER2 subtype  8 3%\n\nvs  16 7%  Fig 1 \n\nClinical outcomes\nDuring a median follow-up period of 59  range  12–131

rate of chemotherapy given could be addressed as another advantage of the adher-\n\nence to breast screening  45 4% in the adherence vs 62 3% in the non-adherence  In our\n\nstudy  the patients with adherence to breast screening showed a better outcome than the\n\npatients with non-adherence despite of a lower rate of adjuvant chemotherapy  It is reasonable\n\nbecause the non-adherence group had higher rates of HER2 expression and TNBC subtype \n\nThe higher chance of sparing toxicity from chemotherapy in the adherence group would be\n\nrecognized as the benefit of breast screening program \n\nWe recognize that our study had some limitations  One major caveat is the retrospective\n\ndesign  as well as the inclusion of a small number of patients from a single institute  Future\n\nstudies involving multi-institutional databases are warranted to affirm our results  Also \n\nanother limitation is to acknowledge that clinical outcome can be affected by various variables\n\nincluding duration of endocrine treatments and complexity of clinical behavior  which are not\n\nfully considered in our analyses  Thus  our findings should be carefully integrated into current\n\nknowledge on pro and cons of breast screening program  Despite these limitations  one\n\nstrength of our study is the population included in the study  which represents patients treated\n\nin daily practice because the definition of breast screening included private practice breast\n\nscreening  as well as the national screening program  Furthermore  our findings obtained\n\namong selected patients with small  early-phase tumors further support the use of breast\n\nscreening  as tumors detected using this modality remained associated with better tumor bio-\n\nlogic characteristics and a favorable prognosis \n\nConclusions\nBreast cancers identified under adherence to breast screening are associated with a more favor-\n\nable tumor biology and better prognosis  even during the early phase  Our

histocompatibility complex class I peptides for recognition by\ntumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  In this study  we investigated the immunohisto-\nchemical expression of TAP1 and TAP2 in 160 patients with breast cancer and correlated\ntheir expression levels with clinicopathologic parameters  The median age of the patient\ncohort was 52 5 years  range  30–86 years  Both TAP1 and TAP2 immunohistochemical\nexpression levels correlated significantly with breast cancer characteristics  P  10 = high  for analysis \n\nResults\nPatient profiles\nThis study utilized breast cancer specimens obtained from 160 female patients during surgery \n\nThe median patient age was 52 5 years  range  30–86 years   Table 2  The majority of patients\n\n 83%  had a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma at the time of surgery  For the remaining\n\n17%  diagnoses were invasive lobular carcinoma  a combination of invasive ductal and lobular\n\ncarcinoma  or other breast carcinomas  Seventy-eight tumors were clinically positive for\n\nHER2/neu and 81 were negative  HER2/neu status was not available for 1 patient  The tumors\n\nencompassed a broad range of stages and grades  Twenty-seven patients expressed high levels\n\nof ER  65 patients expressed low levels  and 33 patients did not express ER  Twenty-one\n\npatients expressed high levels of PR  68 patients expressed low levels  and 36 patients did not\n\nexpress PR  ER and PR information was incomplete for 35 patients \n\nDistributions of TAP1 and TAP2 expression\nThe tumor specimens represented in the TMAs expressed the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits at var-\n\nious levels  Fig 1A–1J  The median quick score  staining × intensity score  was 6  mean score \n7 6  for TAP1 and 10  mean score  9 6  for TAP2  Because TAP1 and TAP2 are both located\n\non chromosome 6 and are under the control of IFN-γ to form a heterodimer in the endoplas-\nmic reticulum membrane  we asked whether the expression of these subunits correlated with\n\nTable 1  Quick score method accounting for the percentage of cells staining positive for a particular\nmarker and the intensity of antibody staining \n\nScore  A  Percentage of

study contradict a previously pub-\n\nlished report investigating TAP1 and TAP2 levels in 53 patients with breast carcinoma [27]  as\n\nwell as a report investigating TAP1 levels in primary vs metastatic breast cancer [28]  Vitale\n\net al [27] found that TAP1 and TAP2 downregulation occurred in 68% of high-grade breast\n\ncancer lesions and in none of the low-grade lesions  Additionally  they reported that HLA class\n\nI antigen was also downregulated and that this change was associated with TAP downregula-\n\ntion  Downregulation of TAP is required for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte recognition [16]  Kakla-\n\nmanis et al [28] measured TAP1 levels in metastatic breast cancer  a subgroup not investigated\n\nin our study  and discovered that TAP1 loss was associated with total loss of HLA class I in pri-\n\nmary and metastatic tumors  In our study and that of Vitale et al [27]  both FFPE tissue sec-\n\ntions and identical anti-TAP1 and TAP2 antibodies [31] were used  so the differences likely\n\nare not due to differences in methodology \n\nMany investigations in the literature have demonstrated loss of TAP1 and TAP2 expression\n\nin human cancers [7–14  31–35]  These previous studies suggest that class I antigen processing\n\ndefects may be associated with malignant transformation of cells  Similarly  Liu et al reported\n\nlower expression levels of TAP1  p = 0 006  and TAP2  p =  0004  in patients with more\n\nadvanced stage breast cancer [22]  Our study has shown the opposite  with TAP1 and TAP2\n\nbeing expressed at lower levels in early stages of breast cancer  Our results also indicate that as\n\nthe tumors become less differentiated  higher grade  they express higher levels of TAP1 and\n\nTAP2  One potential explanation for these results is that more immune infiltrates may be pres-\n\nent in the tumor microenvironment in advanced stage and higher grade tumors  These\n\nimmune cells may be secreting IFN-γ  thus causing upregulation of the TAP subunits in the\ntumor cells [13  36  37]  Alternatively  as the tumor cells lose control of their cell cycle and\n\nbecome less differentiated  they may lose the ability to control expression of the TAP genes \nAlthough the field of immunology and immunotherapy has always emphasized the tumor’s\n\nability to downregulate critical players in the class I antigen processing pathway  our results\n\nsuggest that tumors may not be able to effectively downregulate TAP genes at advanced stages \nLiu et al has shown that the extent of CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the primary site of breast can-\n\ncer was positively associated with expression levels of TAP1  P  004  [22]  High levels of\nTAP1 positively correlated with longer relapse-free survival in patients with breast cancer who\n\nunderwent chemotherapy [23] \n\nOne of the limitations of the current study is the small representation of grade 1 tumors\n\n only 4 patients had grade 1 tumors  so the study underpowered to draw conclusions about\n\nthose subsets of patients \n\nBecause prior evidence in the literature suggested loss of TAP expression in various cancers \n\nTAP has emerged as a strong candidate for adjuvant immunotherapies and vaccines aimed at\n\nincreasing the number of peptide antigens that tumors present to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [18 \n\n38–40]  Our results indicate that these strategies may not be necessary in advanced stages and\n\nhigher grades of breast cancer  which already display the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits  These\n\ntreatment strategies may need to be carefully tailored to specific cancer types and subgroups of\n\npatients to have maximal benefit \n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge the Pathology Research Core facility at Mayo Clinic for providing\n\nTMA and assisting

breast cancer  OBC  is a special type of breast cancer  Its\ninitial symptoms include metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes\nor other parts of the body  where primary lesions cannot be\nidentiﬁed by breast palpation or imaging  other sources can be\nexcluded [1] Because OBC is rare and there is a lack of clinical\nresearch with large sample sizes  there are controversies over its\ndiagnosis and treatment  18F-ﬂurodeoxyglucose  18F-FDG \npositron emission tomography/computed tomography  PET/\nCT  plays a critical role in diagnosing carcinoma in patients [2 3]\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy  NAC  is one of the most compre-\nhensive tumor therapies that have been developed since the 1980s\nand has been widely used in treating breast cancer [4 5] although\nits use in OBC is rarely reported  In this study  OBC was detected\nin 5 patients by 18F-FDG PET/CT  these patients were then\n\nwith NAC  The clinical data on these 5 patients  their\nses  and their treatments were analyzed and

LABC  with\ngood response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  NACT  still remains controversial  The objective in this study is to analyze the safety of\nBCS in the management of LABC in patients with good

devel-\noped and developing countries  The HER2 gene  also \nknown as erbB- 2 or neu  located on chromosome 17q21  \nbelongs to the family of epidermal growth factor recep-\ntor  EGFR  It encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein \n p185  with tyrosine kinase activity  which is closely \nrelated to EGFR  and plays an important role in the \nregulation of cell growth  differentiation  and invasion \n[1]  HER2 overexpression due to gene amplification is \na recognized negative prognostic factor in breast cancer \n\n[2–5]  HER2- targeted therapy significantly improves the \nsurvival of breast cancer patients with HER2 overexpres-\nsion [6–9] \n\nHER2 protein consists of four domains  extracellular \ndomain  transmembrane domain  tyrosine kinase domain  \nand the carboxy tail [10]  The tail coding region of HER2 \nprotein is a largely unstructured domain and plays a criti-\ncal role in the regulation of the enzyme activity of the \nkinase [11–14]  We hypothesized that alteration of the \ntail coding region may affect the function of HER2 pro-\ntein  and therefore influence the prognosis of breast cancer \npatients  To date  however  few studies are available in \nsuch topic

leukocytes  and then HER2 exon 27 mutations were detected \nby direct sequencing  Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan–Meier curves \nand the differences between the curves were compared by log- rank tests  A \ntotal cohort of 892 female patients with operable primary breast cancer was \nincluded in this study  The median follow- up was 47 months  Of these 892 \npatients  3 7%  33/892  had

are small non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regu-\nlators of gene expression and are dysregulated in cancer  Studies of miRNAs to explore\ntheir potential as diagnostic and

subcellular distri-\nbution of the miRNAs  In vitro  miR-143 promoted proliferation of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231\ncells  whereas miR-145 and the cotransfection of both miRNAs inhibited proliferation in all\nthree cell lines  The cells’ invasive capacity was reduced after transfection and cotransfec-\ntion of the miRNAs  In line with the tumor suppressive functions in vitro  the expression of\nmiR-143 and miR-145 was lower in malignant compared to benign breast tissue  and lower\nin the more aggressive tumors with higher tumor grade  loss of ER and the basal-like pheno-\ntype  ISH revealed miR-143 to be cytoplasmatic and predominantly expressed in luminal\ncells in benign tissue  whilst miR-145 was nuclear and with strong staining in myoepithelial\ncells  Both miRNAs were present in malignant epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts in BC \nThis study demonstrates that miR-143 and -145 have functional properties and expression\npatterns typical for tumor suppressors  but the function is influenced by cellular factors such\nas cell type and miRNA cotransfection  Further  the nuclear functions of miR-145 should be\nexplored for a more complete understanding of the

receptor status where tumors can be\n\ncategorized as estrogen receptor positive  ER+  and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor\n\n2 positive  HER2+  or triple negative  TN  [2]  The ER+ BCs constitute nearly 70% of all cases\n\n[3]  and this group has extended therapeutic options  compared to the HER2+ and TN BCs \n\nBased on gene expression profiles  the ER+ tumors can be divided into the molecular sub-\n\ntypes luminal A and luminal B  where the luminal B subtype has a worse prognosis due to a\n\nhigher proliferation rate and/or HER2 positivity [4  5]  The HER2+ BCs are commonly associ-\n\nated with ductal carcinoma in situ  DCIS  and in general have a moderate to poor prognosis\n[4  5]  The TN BCs constitute a heterogeneous group of tumors  where the majority of cases\n\nare presented as basal-like BCs [6]  The TN BCs typically include the most aggressive breast\n\ncarcinomas  where the majority of cancer related death occur within five years from time of\n\ndiagnosis [5  6]  Molecular profiles are used to guide treatment  However  when comparing\n\nindividual cases  BCs have highly heterogeneous gene expression contributing to the chal-\n\nlenges of treating BC patients [7]  Further  BC is still one of the leading causes of cancer deaths\n\nin women [1]  underlining the need for improved prognostic and predictive biomarkers for\n\nearly detection  identification and stratification of the most aggressive tumors  and more tar-\n\ngeted treatment \n\nMicroRNAs  miRNAs  constitute a group of small non-coding endogenous RNAs with a\n\ntypical length of 18–22 nucleotides  Mature miRNAs bind to the complementary or semi com-\n\nplementary 3’untranslated region  3’-UTR  of mRNAs  resulting in negative regulation of pro-\n\ntein translation [8]  The downregulation of protein synthesis can be a result of miRNA\n\ninduced mRNA degradation  mRNA destabilization  or mRNA silencing [9]  The nature of the\n\nnegative regulation is dependent upon the degree of complementarity between the mature\n\nmiRNA and the 3’-UTR target [9]  Due to the highly pleiotropic nature of miRNAs  it is pre-\n\ndicted that more than 60% of all human protein coding genes are influenced by miRNAs  and\n\ntheir dysregulation is a universal event for virtually all types of malignancies  as they have a\n\nprofound influence on most cellular processes [10–12]  Expression profiles of miRNA have\n\nbeen shown to categorize various cancers more accurately than mRNA [13]  and miRNAs can\n\nbe considered novel regulators in the hallmarks of human cancers [14]  Combined with miR-\n\nNAs’ biochemical properties that make them suitable as biomarkers  it is of great scientific\n\ninterest to investigate and characterize individual miRNAs  their expression  and their func-\n\ntional roles in BC and BC subtypes \n\nMiR-143 and miR-145 constitute a miRNA cluster and appear to have tumor suppressor\n\nfunctions in a variety of organ systems  both as individual miRNAs and as a cluster [15–24] \n\nThis study evaluates the miR-143 and miR-145 expression profile in an unselected cohort of\n\nBC within the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study  NOWAC  postgenome cohort [25] \n\nSamples were stratified in subgroups based on molecular subtype  receptor status  tumor grade\n\nand lymph node status  In addition  through a series of in vitro experiments  including assays\nfor cell proliferation and cell invasion  the functionality of miR-143 and miR-145 was studied\n\nin BC cell lines analogous to the major subtypes of breast cancer  ER+  HER2+ and TN BC

these miRNAs in benign and malignant breast tissue  Using\n\nISH  we found the highest expression of miR-145 in myoepithelial cells in benign breast tissue \n\nThis is in line with other smaller

the cytoplasm [37]  Although the nuclear functions of\n\nmature miRNAs remain elusive  there is growing evidence of specific miRNAs localized to the\n\nnucleus [38–40]  Park et al  suggest that nuclear miRNAs could uncover an entirely new role\n\nfor this family of non-coding RNAs [40] where transportation across the nuclear membrane\n\ncould regulate miRNA storage and function  Further  it is suggested that nuclear miRNA\n\ncould be involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing via the nuclear RNA induced silencing\n\ncomplex  nRISC  transcriptional gene activation via recruitment of transcriptional activators \n\nand influence splicing decisions at specific exons  alternative splicing  [41] \n\nUsing microarray and PCR  we found miR-145 to be significantly higher in ER+ tumors \n\nwhich is in line with a previous study on lymph-node negative tumors where ER status was\n\nbased on gene expression using microarray [42]  In our study  the expression of both miR-143\n\nand miR-145 was elevated in the least aggressive tumor types  which is in line with the tumor\n\nsuppressor functions described for these miRNAs in previous publications [15–19  43]  Fur-\n\nther  the

are operating or driving the oncogenic\n\nphenotype in specific cell types where ER would be the classical example in ER+ BC  Notewor-\n\nthy  miRNA-profiling of BC cells has demonstrated that miRNA-based clusters follow ER-\n\nbased dichotomization of cell lines  indicating that a significant number of miRNAs may\n\ndirectly  or indirectly  be regulated by ER-signaling [59] \n\nThe results in this study  including the differential effects in vitro of miR-143 in BC cell lines \nthe effects of cotransfecting miR-143 and miR-145  and the nuclear enrichment of miR-145 in\n\nbreast tissue  underline the complexity of miRNA regulation and function  Studies of miRNA\n\nexpression in tissues and cancer types should be supplied by functional research of individual\n\nmiRNAs where

ARTICLE\n\nBreast density does not impact the ability of\n\nVidessa® Breast to detect breast cancer in\n\nwomen under age 50\n\nDavid E  Reese  Meredith C  Henderson  Michael Silver  Rao Mulpuri  Elias Letsios \nQuynh Tran  Judith K  Wolf*\n\nProvista Diagnostics  New York  NY  United States of America\n\n* wolfj@provistadx com\n\nAbstract\n\nBreast density is associated with reduced imaging resolution in the detection of breast can-\ncer  A biochemical approach that is not affected by density would provide an important tool\nto healthcare professionals who are managing women with dense breasts and suspicious\nimaging findings  Videssa® Breast is a combinatorial proteomic biomarker assay  CPBA \ncomprised of Serum Protein Biomarkers  SPB  and Tumor Associated Autoantibodies\n TAAb  integrated with patient-specific clinical data to produce a diagnostic score that reli-\nably detects breast cancer  BC  as an adjunctive tool to imaging  The performance of\nVidessa® Breast was evaluated in the dense  a and b  and non-dense  c and d  groups in a\npopulation of n = 545 women under age 50  The sensitivity and specificity in the dense\nbreast group were calculated to be 88 9% and 81 2%  respectively  and 92 3% and 86 6% \nrespectively  for the non-dense group  No significant differences were observed in the sensi-\ntivity  p = 1 0  or specificity  p = 0 18  between these groups  The NPV was 99 3% and\n99 1% in non-dense and dense groups  respectively  Unlike imaging  Videssa® Breast does\nnot appear to be impacted by breast density  it can effectively detect breast cancer in\nwomen with dense and non-dense breasts alike  Thus  Videssa® Breast provides a powerful\ntool for healthcare providers when women with dense breasts present with challenging\nimaging findings  In addition  Videssa® Breast provides assurance to women with dense\nbreasts that they do not have breast cancer  reducing further anxiety in this higher risk\npatient population \n\nBackground\nImaging is currently the gold standard for breast cancer detection  When imaging results are\n\nquestionable  scored as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System  BI-RADS  3 or 4  NCCN\n\nGuidelines recommend that BI-RADS 3 are followed with re-imaging at 6 months  while BI-R-\n\nADS 4 are recommended for biopsy [1]  Confounding factors such as breast density may limit\n\nthe effectiveness of imaging [2–4]  Breast density is a radiologic phenomenon that is not\n\ndiscernable by palpation  it is a radiologist’s assessment  Imaging rays permeate dense breast\n\nPLOS ONE |

in a more opaque manner  thereby reducing image resolution [5]  Density is subdivided\n\ninto four categories   a  almost entirely fatty  10% of women   b  scattered areas of fibrogland-\nular density  40%   c  heterogenously dense  40%  and  d  extremely dense  10%  African\nAmerican women tend to have higher breast density than women of European descent [6] \n\nWomen with very dense breasts are at a four- to five-fold increased risk of developing breast\n\ncancer compared to women with low breast density [2 7 8]  In addition  women with\n\nextremely dense breasts are 10 times more likely to have an abnormality missed on mammo-\n\ngram [1] \n\nThirty-two U S  states have laws mandating that women be notified of the implications of\n\nbreast density to encourage discussions between patients and health-care providers regarding\n\nthe need for supplemental screening [9–11]  Of the 32 states currently mandating notifications \n\n21 mention the association with increased cancer risk and 17 mention supplemental screening \n\nof which only four mention specific screening modalities  This lack of consistency leads to\n\nconfusion for healthcare providers in the management of women with dense breasts and their\n\nfollow-up  In addition  the notification of increased breast cancer risk can increase anxiety in\n\nwomen with a dense breast assessment \n\nRecently  a study evaluated the differential screening performance of digital mammography\n\ncombined with tomosynthesis compared to digital mammography alone as a function of breast\n\ndensity [12]  When tomosynthesis was combined with digital mammography for screening \n\nthe cancer detection rate increased  by ~20%  and recall rates decreased  by ~13%  for women\n\nwith dense and non-dense breasts  These improvements were most pronounced in women\n\nwith heterogeneously dense breasts but were not significant for women with extremely dense\n\nbreasts  Therefore  imaging limitations persist in the dense breast patient population despite\n\nadvancements made by tomosynthesis  A separate study evaluated the inter-observer precision\n\nof scoring breast density in a group of ten mammography technologists and seven radiologists\n\n[13]  This study identified that mammography technologists over-grade breast density  which\n\ncan result in redundant ultrasound studies  unnecessary breast biopsies  increased costs  and\n\npatient anxiety  A biochemical approach that is independent of breast architecture and density\n\nwould provide an important tool to healthcare professionals who are managing women with\n\ndense breasts \n\nRecently  clinical performance data was published on Videssa1 Breast  a CPBA comprised\n\nof SPB and TAAb integrated with clinical characteristic data to produce one diagnostic score\n\nthat reliably detects breast cancer [14]  Certain blood-based biomarkers are associated with\n\nhigher mammographic density [15]  it is unknown whether the biomarkers included in\n\nVidessa1 Breast might be impacted as well  The objective of this study was to evaluate the per-\n\nformance of Videssa1 Breast in women with dense and non-dense breasts and determine\n\nwhether this test could provide an additional tool to healthcare providers managing women\n\nwho present with dense breasts and challenging imaging findings \n\nMethods\nStudy design and

as\n\neither BI-RADS 3 or 4 at the time of enrollment  All imaging modalities such as mammogra-\n\nphy  3D tomography  ultrasound and MRI were permitted in the trial for the assessment of\n\nBI-RADS 3 or 4  Participants were enrolled at 13 clinical sites across the US  and the study was\n\nIRB-approved at all of these sites  S1 Table  All participants provided written informed con-\n\nsent

04/2013–06/2014 for Provista-001 and between 04/2014–02/2015 for Provista-002 \n\nBreast density status was retrospectively collected for all participants according to the\n\nAmerican College of Radiology reporting system [16] \n\n1  The breasts are almost entirely fatty\n\n2  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density\n\n3  The breasts are heterogeneously dense  which may obscure small masses\n\n4  The breasts are extremely dense  which lowers the sensitivity of mammography\n\nIn this study  “dense” breasts were defined as being assigned Category c or d and “non-\ndense” breasts as Category a or b \n\nMeasurement of SPB and TAAb in serum\nSerum was tested for SPB and TAAb as previously described [14]  Briefly  SPB plates were pur-\n\nchased from Meso Scale Discovery  MSD  Rockville  MD  and processed as per manufacturer\n\ninstructions  Recombinant TAAb proteins were purchased from Origene  Rockville  MD  and\n\nAbnova  Walnut  CA  and coated on standard-bind MSD 384-well plates  Samples were ana-\n\nlyzed for the relative presence or absence of TAAb by indirect ELISA  All plates were read\n\nusing a Meso Sector S600 plate reader and Discovery Workbench 4 0 software \n\nVidessa® Breast assessment\nSerum was tested with Videssa1 Breast as previously described [14]  Briefly  SPB and TAAb\n\ndata are combined with patient age into a logistic regression algorithm  the final output being\n\na high protein signature  HPS  or low protein signature  LPS  The protein signature outcome\n\ncorresponds to the likelihood of BC at the time of sample collection  BC samples scored as\n\nHPS were categorized as true positive  TP  and BC samples scored as LPS were categorized as\n\nfalse negative  FN  Benign samples scored as HPS were categorized as false positive  FP  and\n\nbenign samples scored as LPS were categorized as true negative  TN \n\nStatistical analyses\nClinical performance metrics were calculated using the following \n\nSensitivity =  True Positives    True Positives + False Negatives \n\nSpecificity =  True Negatives    True Negatives + False Positives \n\nPPV =  True Positives    True Positives + False Positives \n\nNPV =  True Negatives    True Negatives + False Negatives \n\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS  version 9 3  SAS  Cary  NC  and the 95% confi-\n\ndence intervals were calculated using VassarStats  which utilizes the efficient-score method\n\n corrected for continuity  [17 18] \n\nResults\nStudy population\nAn overview of the Provista-001 and Provista-002 clinical trials is provided in Fig 1  In

as\n\ndefined by American College of Radiology [19] \n\nEvaluation of individual Videssa® Breast biomarkers in women with\ndense and non-dense breasts\nThe individual biomarkers included in Videssa1 Breast were evaluated in the dense and non-\n\ndense groups to determine whether there were any individual biomarkers that were differen-\n\ntially expressed between these groups  These data are

higher  though not statistically significant  in the non-dense group\n\n 36 4% and 24 2% for non-dense and dense breasts  respectively \n\nDiscussion\nDense breast tissue has been shown to significantly impact the ability of imaging modalities to\n\ndetect breast cancer lesions  resulting in increased false-negatives and false-positives [2 20] \n\nOften  clinically  dense breast tissue results in additional imaging above and beyond standard\n\nmammography [12]  Furthermore  confusion is likely when women are informed of a dense\n\nbreast assessment but are not provided with clinical direction  Women who are informed that\n\nthey have dense breast tissue may believe this to be a clinically significant finding  akin to a\n\nbenign condition  Recent advances in imaging have attempted to improve imaging in dense\n\nbreast patients with limited success [12]  A protein-based diagnostic assay that is unaffected by\n\ndensity would be a powerful non-invasive tool to compliment current imaging technologies \n\nWhile individual protein biomarker expression levels have been shown to be altered by\n\nbreast density  it was unclear whether a biomarker panel composed of many individual bio-\n\nmarkers would be affected  An interesting observation from this study is the lack of statistical\n\ndifference in dense verses non-dense for TAAb  but not SPB  While some SPB did show statis-\n\ntically significant differences  Videssa1 Breast demonstrated high sensitivity in women with\n\nnon-dense and dense breasts  92 3% and 88 9%  respectively  This test also exhibited high\n\nspecificity in both groups  86 6% and 81 2%  respectively  There were no significant differences\n\nobserved in the sensitivity or specificity of the Videssa1 Breast between patients with non-\n\ndense and dense breasts  NPV exceeded 99% in both groups  but this figure may be skewed\n\ndue to low disease prevalence  Prior test probability was 8% for non-dense and 6% for dense\n\nbreast subjects  Table 3  based on BC prevalence in the study population  Posterior probability\n\nfor a negative  LPS  test outcome was 1% for both groups  meaning a negative test will almost\n\nalways correspond to the subject being free of breast cancer  Therefore  unlike imaging \n\nVidessa1 Breast is not impacted by breast density  it can reliably detect breast cancer in\n\nwomen under age 50 with dense and non-dense breasts  While additional studies are needed\n\nto determine validity in other age/clinical groups  these results strongly argue for the use of an\n\nanatomical assessment  imaging  in conjunction with an assay  biologic/protein measure-\n\nment  such as Videssa1 Breast  in women with dense breasts \n\nThe population studied were all subjects with either benign  DCIS  or cancerous findings  A\n\nlarge number of benign subjects  221/513  or 43%  did not undergo biopsy  therefore clinical\n\nsensitivity and specificity may have been slightly underestimated  Breast cancer prevalence is\n\ngenerally low in women under age 50  5 9% in this study  thus an enriched population  BI-R-\n\nADS 3 and 4  was necessary  Because Videssa1 Breast is indicated only for BI-RADS 3 or 4 \n\nthis study was also a robust test of assay performance in the intended use population  Because\n\nof Videssa1 Breast’s high negative predictive value  there is likely value in ruling out cancer in\n\nwomen with dense breasts  who may experience higher recall rates  The incorporation of\n\nVidessa1 Breast into the clinical decision-making process has the potential to decrease medi-\n\ncal costs associated with additional imaging and biopsy while simultaneously calming the anxi-\n\nety that women with dense breasts may experience with imaging alone \n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that Videssa1 Breast performance is comparable in women with\n\ndense and non-dense breasts  Videssa1 Breast demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in\n\ndetecting breast cancer  irrespective of density status  Thus  Videssa1 Breast provides an\n\nBreast density does not impact Videssa® Breast detection of breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi

currently the focus of\nncer research  Researches[1 2] have demonstrated that\nession of estrogen receptor  ER  progesterone receptor\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER-2  are\n\nabsent in patients with TNBC  Compared with non-triple-\nnegative breast cancer  N-TNBC  patients with TNBC have\nshort survival and poor clinical prognosis [2] In addition  elderly\nand young patients have similar survival rates [3]\n\nE-cadherin  E-cad  the most important member of the cell\nadhesion molecule family  is synthesized by the cadherin gene\nlocated on chromosome 16q22 1 [4] E-cad is a cell adhesion\nmolecule that mediates cell molecular recognition and binding \ntumor inﬁltration  and metastasis [4] It is composed of 3 domains \na cytoplasmic domain  a transmembrane domain  and an\nextracellular domain  which is bound to Ca2+ [5] Highly\nconserved cytoplasmic domain of E-cad forms a complex with\nthe actin ﬁbers to maintain the stability of cell adhesion and\npolarity  mediate cell-cell adhesion  and involve in cell signal-\ning [6] Abnormalities of the E-cad expression can result in the\nmetastasis of epithelial tumors from the primary tumor and\nacross the basement membrane [4 7]\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  is an important\nangiogenesis regulator identiﬁed in the process of mitosis of\nendothelial cells [8] Overexpression of VEGF leads to the\nproliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells [9]\n\nVEGF promotes neovascularization and tumor angiogenesis \nand therefore is closely associated with tumor growth [10]\n\nStudies[11 12] have shown that molecular characteristics of\nTNBC are different among ethnic groups in China  Compared\n\nthe Han  tumors in Uygur TNBC patients are large\naged late [13 14] In

 we found that the number of\nce and metastasis was 44 cases  26 6%  and 26 cases\nin Han and Uygur TNBC patients  respectively  without\nnt difference  There was no signiﬁcant difference in 5-\nase-free survival between 2 groups \nhas shown that the invasion of tumor cells and\nn levels of E-cad are negatively correlated [25] By\nession of E-cad  the invasion of tumor cells can be\nly inhibited [26] E-cad plays an important role in the\nent and progression of TNBC and can be used as a\n\ntic indicator of TNBC [19 27] In this study  we found that\nession of E-cad was negatively correlated with the lymph\ntus  TNM staging  and histological grading in both the\nUygur groups  With the increased number of lymph\n\ntastasis  the later clinical stage  the higher histological\nck of E-cad expression is more obvious  which affects the\nis of patients with TNBC  The 5-year overall survival and\nree survival rates of E-cad-negative patients with 61%\nwere signiﬁcantly lower than those of E-cad-positive\n\nwith 89% and 65%  respectively [28]\n\nxpression of VEGF in TNBC has correlation with lymph\ntastasis and tumor stage  and is prone to cause early\nce and metastasis of TNBC and poor prognosis [29] A\nTNBC recurrence has shown that the expression of\nsigniﬁcantly different in different stages of TNBC [30] In\nng et al showed HIF1a  VEGF related to Wnt  and\nand in patients with AML  but the mechanism has not\n\nvestigated [31] Our study showed that the positive\nn rate of VEGF was positively correlated with the\nof lymph node metastasis and TNM staging in Han and\nNBC patients  but not the histological grading  which\nsistent with previous report [32] With the increased\nof lymph node metastasis and TNM stage  the positive\nn of VEGF gradually increased  indicating that VEGF\nertain role in the progress of TNBC \nh node metastasis  TNM staging  and histological\nare important basis for clinical judgment of prognosis\nrence clues for development of individualized compre-\ntreatment program [33] The correlation of E-cad and\nith lymph node metastasis  TNM stage  and histological\nrther suggests that we should pay great attention to the\nes of E-cad and VEGF expression in different ethnic\natients  E-cad andVEGFmay have clinical signiﬁcance as\ntargets  Individual treatment strategies for TNBC\nof different ethnic groups should be taken to obtain a\nure rate and survival rate \nclusion  we reported that the 5-year disease-free survival\nTNBC patients in Han and Uygur patients had no\nnt difference  but the difference of VEGF expression rate\nistically signiﬁcant  indicating that VEGF could be used\ndependent factor in the prognosis of TNBC  With the\nof VEGF expression  the prognosis is worse [34]\n\nile  this study also showed that the positive expression\nEGF in Uygur TNBC patients was higher than that in\ntients  but the 5-year disease-free survival rate and\nn of E-cad were not signiﬁcantly different  In the\nis of N-TNBC  it has been demonstrated that the 6-year\nree survival rate of Uygur Lumina A breast cancer\nis lower than that of Han patients [13] Therefore  these\n\nRefer\n\n[1] Ad\nde\n\n[2] D\ncli\n44\n\n[3]

from\npatients’ specimens and propagated in vitro with feeder cells and a Rho kinase inhibitor  A\nnumber of these cells have been generated from biopsies of breast cancer patients  includ-\ning ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinomas  The characterization of their genomic\nsignatures is essential to determine their ability to reflect the natural biology of their tumors\nof origin  In this study  we performed the genomic characterization of six newly established\ninvasive breast cancer CRC cultures in comparison to the original patients’ primary breast\ntumors  PBT  from which they derived  The CRCs and corresponding PBTs were simulta-\nneously profiled by genome-wide array-CGH  targeted next generation sequencing and\nglobal miRNA expression to determine their molecular similarities in the patterns of copy\nnumber alterations  CNAs  gene mutations and miRNA expression levels  respectively \nThe CRCs’ epithelial cells content and ploidy levels were also evaluated by flow cytometry \nA similar level of CNAs was observed in the pairs of CRCs/PBTs analyzed by array-CGH \nwith >95% of overlap for the most frequently affected cytobands  Consistently  targeted next\ngeneration sequencing analysis showed the retention of specific somatic variants in the\nCRCs as present in their original PBTs  Global miRNA profiling closely clustered the CRCs\nwith their

profiling of five pairs of CRCs and corresponding PBTs  A  Supervised Hierarchical\nClustering  SHC  analysis  Pearson Correlation  Anova P P5<P10  It is of note  however  that in our previous CRC study in mouse mammary tissues\n\nwe showed that the genomic  array-CGH  profiling of the CRCs resembled the ones from the\n\nnon-CRC cultures at P<38 [13]  Interestingly  cytogenetic analysis of human cells immortal-\n\nized by other methods of somatic reprograming  such as the ones applied for the generation of\n\nhuman pluripotent stem cells  hPSCs  [32–37]  have shown a higher number of CNAs in early\n\ncell passages when compared to the late passage cells  These studies suggested that CNAs are\n\neither introduced during the reprogramming process or represent a sub-clone of aberrant\n\nparental cell that rapidly grows in vitro [32 33]  In fact  higher resolution analysis  such as\nwhole-genome sequencing applied to hPSCs have suggested the later  considering that the\n\nCNAs observed could already be detected at low frequencies in the parental somatic cells\n\n[34 35]  Overall these studies indicate that these CNAs are effects of passages number and not\n\nof the reprogramming process per se  Supporting these observations  the abnormal karyotypes\nand CNAs that are reported in the hPSCs  occur non-randomly  affecting most commonly the\n\nchromosomes 1  12  17  20 and X [32–37]  In our cases we did identify CNAs affecting some of\n\nthese chromosomes  but in most cases these CNAs were also observed in the original corre-\n\nsponding  and uncultured  PBTs \n\nThe targeted next generation sequencing analysis also showed that the established CRCs\n\nretained the specific gene mutations that were present in their original tumors  An analysis of\n\nthree paired CRCs and PBTs  Cases 2  4 and 6  showed that they share the same type of variants\n\naffecting the TP53  FLT3  JAK3  KDR  PIK3CA and CDKN2A genes  In the unpaired CRC  case\n3  sequenced  variants in the TP53  JAK3  KDR and CDKN2A genes were observed  The same\nvariant in the TP53 gene that led to a codon  cCc/cGc  and aminoacid change  P72R  was\nobserved in this CRC compared to the others CRCs and corresponding PBTs  This specific var-\n\niant  COSM45985  is one of the most common polymorphisms in the TP53 gene and was pre-\nviously reported in cancer cases [38–43]  although its association with cancer risk is unknown \n\nMissense mutations in the JAK3  KDR and CDKN2A genes in this CRC affected different\ncodons and led to different aminoacid changes than the ones observed in the paired CRCs and\n\nPBTs sequenced  However  these variants were previously reported in other tumors  such as\n\nskin [44]  glioblastomas [45] and leukemias [46–48]  JAK 3/COSM 34213  colorectal [49] \nprostate [50] and sarcomas [51]  KDR/COSM 149673  In addition  to these gene variants this\nCRC line presented missense mutations affecting the MET  COSM 1286164  and KIT  COSM\n28026  genes  not observed in the paired cases  As for the other variants  these mutations were\n\nalso reported to be present in other tumor tissues [52–54]  including breast cancer [52]  indi-\n\ncating their tumor genome representativeness \n\nThe overall similarity of genome-wide copy number and gene mutation patterns of paired\n\nCRCs and PBTs  was also observed in our cases at the miRNA expression level  Experimental\n\nstudies have shown that both the biogenesis and expression levels of miRNAs are “susceptible”\n\nto effects of cell culture conditions  including the ones that affect cellular density and contact \n\nreplicated passages and senescence [55–59]  A recent study utilized miRNA expression to\n\nConditionally reprogrammed cell cultures from breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0186190 October 19  2017 13 / 18\n\n\n\n\ncompare the effects of different cell reprogramming methods in cultured cells and medium\n\n[60]  By measuring miRNA levels in the cell culture medium of pluripotent stem cells in com-\n\nparison to that in cells  it was shown a constant relative abundance of miRNA level between\n\nthem  Similarly  in this study we used miRNA profiling as an “epigenetic measurement” to\n\nevaluate changes in miRNA expression levels that might have occurred in the breast cancer\n\ncells cultured in the CRC system  Supervised Hierarchical Clustering  SHC  showed that the\n\nfive pairs of CRCs and corresponding PBTs profiled for this analysis clustered together with\n\nhigh correlation coefficients  indicating the retention of the miRNA expression signature of\n\nthe original tumors  QRT-PCR analysis of individual four miRNAs chosen alleatorily con-\n\nfirmed the similar expression of these putative miRNAs within four of the CRCs and PBTs\n\npairs  Interestingly  despite the lower number of CRCs representative of each breast cancer\n\n“IHC subtype”  we observed that they clustered distinctly according to their “IHC subtype” \n\nThis analysis supported the suitable potential in classifying breast cancer into the molecular\n\nsubtypes based in miRNA expression  as previously shown for established breast cancer cell\n\nlines and clinical cases [16 61 62] \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion  we demonstrated that the breast cancer CRCs evaluated in this study  main-\n\ntained the overall copy number  gene mutations and miRNA expression patterns of the corre-\n\nsponding tumor tissue from which they derived  Considering that these CRC cultures were\n\nestablished from breast cancer patients with distinct clinical and histopathological characteris-\n\ntics  including age at onset  race  family history and hormonal status  they offer a unique and\n\nrepresentative model of the biological breast cancer heterogeneity  Additional analyses are\n\nrequired to evaluate these cells at late cellular passages and to characterize them by other\n\nmolecular phenotypes  to further expand their utility for cancer research \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  Clinical and pathological information of the six patients’ derived breast cancer\n\nCRCs \n\n DOCX \n\nS2 Table  Exome sequencing analysis of 3

the\n\ntransmembrane receptor family with 100 folds higher expression in tumor cells than normal\n\ntissues [1]  HER2/neu as an immunogenic protein elicits both humoral and cellular immune\n\nresponses  This oncogene is an important biomarker and the goal of therapy for almost 30% of\n\nall breast cancers[2] \n\nImmunotherapy is a treatment that uses certain parts of a person’s immune system to attack\n\ncancer cells specifically[3]  Many Tumor-Associated Antigens  TAAs  can be recognized by\n\nthe immune system [4]  Cancer vaccines belong to a class of substances known as biological\n\nresponse modifiers that work by stimulating or restoring the immune system’s ability to fight\n\ninfections and disease  There are two broad types of cancer vaccines  prophylactic vaccines \n\nwhich are intended to prevent cancer from developing in healthy people  and the second\n\ngroup  therapeutic vaccines  are intended to treat existing cancers by strengthening the body’s\n\nnatural immune response [5] \n\nPeptides used in vaccines are antigenic epitopes derived from TAAs  which can stimulate\n\nimmune regulators including antibodies  helper T cells  and cytotoxic T lymphocytes [6] \n\nAdvantages of peptide vaccines are stability  simple component  and low microbial infection\n\n[7] \n\nGP2 is an immunogenic peptide that is recognized by the endogenous immune system [8] \n\nGP2 with nine amino acids  654–662  IISAVVGIL  is a MHC class I peptide which is derived\n\nfrom HER2 protein’s transmembrane domain  GP2 is an efficient peptide for producing a\n\nmulti-epitope vaccine [9  10]  The results indicated that GP2 peptide can induce a CTL\n\nresponse similar to E75 and it is equally or more immunogenic [11]  Phase I clinical trial dem-\n\nonstrated that GP2 peptide is safe and capable of stimulating a her2-specific immune response\n\n[12]  Because GP2 peptide has a strong potential immunogenicity  it is an appropriate candi-\n\ndate for peptide vaccine trials [11] \n\nIn an immunization formulation  adjuvant components are used to obtain higher stimula-\n\ntion and elongation time of the special immune system against antigens [13]  Toll like receptor\n\n TLR  agonists are novel immunostimulatory adjuvants that can be used for human vaccines\n\n[14]  Monophosphoryl lipid A  MPL  a TLR4 agonist  is a chemically detoxified derivative of\n\nthe parent lipopolysaccharide  LPS  from Salmonella minnesota R595 strain  MPL can provoke\ndendritic cells to secrete inflammatory cytokines such as INF-γ  IL-12  and IL-6 and also acti-\nvate the T cell immune response [15–17]  MLP has been used as a potent adjuvant for design-\n\ning vaccines against some important human diseases such as malaria  HIV-1  meningococcal\n\ntype B disease  breast cancer  prostate cancer  and colon cancer [18]  Therefore  co-delivery of\n\nantigen and adjuvant is essential for impelling an adequate immune response [19] \n\nLiposomes have been extensively studied as carriers for delivering antigens and adjuvants\n\nto antigen-presenting cells  APCs  Efficient delivery of TAAs to the major histocompatibility\n\ncomplex class I presentation pathway in APCs will substantially contribute to establishing\n\nmore effective cancer immunotherapy  The first use of a peptide to raise the immune response\n\nto loaded liposomes was reported by Allison [20] \n\nIn the current study  to increase carrier delivery efficiency we used the helper-fusogenic lip-\n\nids such as DOPE  DOPE transfers from a bilayer structure to hexagonal phase as an endosome\n\nacidifies and delivers the antigens to the cytosol of APCs [21  22] \n\nThere are two ways for liposome antigen incorporation  covalent linking and encapsulation \n\nReportedly  linking of antigen to liposome has higher efficiency in cell mediated immunity\n\nresponse compared to antigen encapsulation [23]  In our previous study  P5

toMaleimide-PEG2000-DSPE with MPL adjuvant induced strong CTL response\n\nthat reduced tumor growth with prolonged survival time in the TUBO tumor mice model\n\n[24] \n\nIn this study  we aimed at developing a liposomal vaccine composed of DMPC- DMPG-\n\nChol- DOPE containing MPL with Gp2 peptide conjugated to the surface of liposomes to\n\nincrease the CTL response and cellular immunity in the BALB/c mice model of TUBO xeno-\n\ngraft cancer \n\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nFour to six week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Pasteur Institute  Tehran-\n\nIran  All procedures

physicochemical characteristics of liposomes have a\n\nsignificant role in the immune response  The particle size may influence the draining as\n\nsmaller-sized liposomes have been shown to be cleared faster from the site of injection than\n\nlarger-sized liposomes [34  35]  In addition to the size  other factors such as lipid composition\n\nimpact on the immunity response[35]  The doses of lipid  MPL adjuvant and peptide have a\n\nclear impact on the T cell response and efficacy of formulations [16]  According to the lipid\n\ndose  4 μm  MPL and peptide doses per mouse were precisely determined as 24 μg and 10 μg \nrespectively for each formulation \n\nInduction of CTL response by Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 formulation\nTo determine immune response induced in the immunized mice  INF-γ and

22\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to generate a cancer vaccine based on immunogenic GP2 peptide\n\nwith the effective adjuvant using a suitable delivery system  We prepared different liposomal\n\nformulations with GP2 peptide to induce enhanced CTL immune response in a TUBO tumor\n\nmodel of mice \n\nGP2 peptide as a TAA has broad applicability as a cancer immunogen with low toxicity[9] \n\nIn a phase II clinical trial using granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor  GM-CSF \n\nas a vaccine adjuvant  it has been reported that GP2 decreased the risk of recurrence in women\n\nwith HER2/neu breast cancer[37]  In another study  Brossart and Dess reported that injection\n\nof GP2 and GP2-pulsed dendritic cells against metastatic breast cancer and advanced ovarian\n\ncancer patients induced CTL immune response[11  38]  It has also been shown that the GP2\n\nbased vaccines are effective in stimulating peptide-specific immunity  especially in CD8+ T\n\ncell stimulation with anti-tumor activity in human leukocyte antigen  HLA -A2 + breast can-\n\ncer patients[37]  The GP2 peptide had immunogenicity in HER2/neu positive breast cancer\n\nand could be used in a multi epitope vaccine formulation [39]  Recent studies revealed that\n\npatientsvaccinatedwithGP2+GM-CSF showed a 37% reduction in cancer recurrence com-\n\npared to unvaccinated patients while those who received GM-CSF alone showed57% reduction\n\nin risk of cancer recurrence [40]  However  Mittendorf reported that local and systemic toxic-\n\nity is due to the GM-CSF use  in most patients usually experienced as grade1 headache  fatigue \n\nerythema  pruritus  bone pain  myalgia  and flu-like symptoms [12]  Of course  GM-CSF can\n\ninduce antitumor immune response but it promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration in\n\ndifferent solid tumors such as skin carcinoma  gliomas  lung cancer  and cancer cell line[41–\n\n43]  It has been shown that pretreatment of three tumor cell lines of breast cancer with trastu-\n\nzumab followed by incubation with GP2 peptide induced CTL immune response[44]  The\n\nimmunogenic potency of the GP2 peptide for applying in HER2-positive breast cancer therapy\n\nin combination with other peptides or with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been\n\ninvestigated [39]  The GP2+GM-CSF primary vaccine series  PVS  consisted of six inocula-\n\ntions and boosters given every 21–28 days [12]  which involves a time and cost consuming\n\nprocedure \n\nLiposomes as carriers of vaccines and drugs are safe [45]  Liposome vaccine delivery pro-\n\nvides more efficacy and safer vaccine formulation in the development of a vaccine for human\n\nuse[46] Liposomes have a major advantage as an antigen delivery system since they have a\n\nlong circulation time and tendency to be taken up more efficiently by APCs to induce CTL\n\nresponse [47  48]  The challenge of inducing strong CTL response could be potentially over-\n\ncome by using the liposomal adjuvant/ delivery systems  Liposomes can reclaim peptide anti-\n\ngen delivery and elevate cellular uptake with dendritic cells[18  49]  The current study\n\ndemonstrates for the first time  the significant benefit of GP2 peptide conjugation toliposomes\n\nwith MPL to induce CD8+ T cell response  The use of MPL in liposomes with aHER2/neu pep-\n\ntide has been reported before [24]  This study aimed at stimulation of CTL response by\n\nGP2HER2/neu peptide and liposomes  hoping that this may be a major substantial approach \n\nFig 2

of treatment with\n\nGM-CSF \n\nVarious animal studies have shown that liposomal formulations have higher antitumor effi-\n\ncacies compared to non-liposomal vaccine systems [50–52]  Liposomal vaccines with basic\n\nfibroblast growth factor bFGF  and MPL adjuvant induced Th1 and tumor-specific antibody\n\nresponse immunity in a mouse model[19]  In addition  liposomes as immune adjuvants could\n\nprovoke cellular and humoral immunity against the antigen [53  54]  E7 is a peptide antigen\n\nwhich is derived from E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus  HPV  type 16  The DOTAP\n\n the cationic lipid  /E7 formulation induced both preventative and therapeutic antitumor\n\neffects against HPV positive TC-1 tumor in a mouse model[55]  Also  the conjugation of the\n\nMUC1 peptide  tumor-associated antigen in lung cancer  to the surface of a liposome with a\n\ncomposition of DPP-DPPG-Chol  3 1 0 25  molar ratio  containing MPL A  1% w/w of the\n\ntotal lipids  elicited strong CTL response[56]  Both Tc-ErbB2/Th-HA peptide antigens  conju-\n\ngated to the surface of liposomes via aPam3CSSanchor  can induce potent antigen-specific\n\nimmune responses in the majority of tumor-bearing mice and delay tumor growth in BALB/c\n\nmice model [57]  A recent study suggested that the covalently linked conalbumin antigen to\n\nDMPC-DPPE-Chol liposom stimulates more secretion of IL-2 and 1FNγ compared to the\nencapsulated antigen  So covalently linked antigen might be particularly useful  its induction\n\nof cell-mediated immunity is of prime importance[23] \n\nIn this study  we used GP2 peptide conjugated to the DOPE-based pH-sensitive liposomes in\n\nthe presence of MPL as an adjuvant for the anti-cancer vaccine  MPL induces the development\n\nof Th1 response and can be connected and activated to the Toll-like receptor4  TLR4  which\n\nplays an important role in the induction of immune response[58]  MPL as a cancer vaccine\n\nadjuvant has been tested in several clinical trials [58]  Reportedly  MPL is safe and immunogenic\n\nin human clinical trials [58  59]and can efficiently deliver the peptide into the APCs to increase\n\nthe elicitation of antigen-specific immune response[51  60]  Zollinger reported that N  meningit-\nides liposomal vaccine was safe in healthy adults and induced bactericidal antibodies[61] \n\nDOPE as a fusogenic lipid can increase the efficiency of liposomal vaccine delivery [22  62] \n\nThe liposome containing DOPE is stable at physiological pH but destabilizes upon acidification\n\n pH<6 5  following cellular internalization through the phase transition DOPE from lamellar\n\nto hexagonal [63]  It has been shown that DOPE-based pH-sensitive liposomes improve the\n\ncytoplasmic delivery of biological

mice and exhibited\n\na low prophylactic effect in terms of tumor growth inhibition  Due to rapid distribution of pro-\n\nteins or synthetic peptides to other organs from the site of injection  antigen specific CTL would\n\nfail in a short time[47  66]  Despite the suitable size of Lip-GP2  142 5 nm  for antigen presenta-\n\ntion to lymph nodes [33]  this formulation could not stimulate a sufficient CTL response  Addi-\n\ntion of MPL and DOPE to the liposome  Lip-DOPE-MPL  increased stimulation of CD8+ cells \n\nand production of IFNγ in mice splenocyte was enhanced  However  the Lip-DOPE-MPL lipo-\nsome could not inhibit tumor growth  Due to the absence of GP2 antigen in Lip-DOPE-MPL \n\nthis formulation would not induce considerable CTL response and long term protective immu-\n\nnity against her2/neu tumor in mice [67]  Although the Lip-DOPE formulation could not\n\ninduce enough immune response  inclusion of the GP2  Lip-DOPE-GP2  was able to deliver\n\nGP2 to MHCI and activate CD8 cells to produce CTLs  Survival tests indicated that vaccination\n\nwith Lip-DOPE-GP2 had a significant protective effect  p<0 001  compared to other groups  It\nshould be noted that Lip-DOPE-GP2 did not show effectiveness in the therapeutic assay and\n\nalso Lip-MPL-GP2 was unable to induce any immune response  These observations indicate the\n\ncrucial role of MPL and DOPE in the formulation  Inclusion of DOPE could destabilize the\n\nliposome-Gp2 binding in lysosomes  facilitating the release of GP2 from the liposome to the\n\nMHC I molecule and therefore enhancing an antigen-specific CTL response[68]  Vaccination\n\nwith Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 resulted in significant CTL response in mice and provided the high-\n\nest level of the significant protective effect  p<0 0001  It also exhibited a potent therapeutic\neffect  p<0 0001  compared to HEPS-dextrose 5% group  The CTL response was found to be\nassociated with higher and lower amounts of IFN-γ and IL-4  respectively  in both protein and\nmRNA expression studies  The mice vaccinated with Lip-DOPE-MPL-GP2 showed a delay in\n\ntumor growth and had a longer survival time in prophylactic and therapeutic assays \n\nAll in all  our findings showed that the presence of co-stimulator molecules such as MPL\n\nand DOPE with antigenic properties of GP2 enhanced the ability of APCs to induce the IFN-γ\nproducing CD8+ cells and increased the level of IFN-γ as a major anti-tumor and Th1 type\nimmunity cytokine \n\nConclusion\nWe demonstrated that the GP2 peptide conjugation on the surface of a liposome composed of\n\nDMPC- DMPG- Chol-DPOE and MPL adjuvant increased splenocytes INF-γ production \nwhich can be applied prophylactically as well as therapeutically to reduce tumor growth in\n\nTable 3  Therapeutic

gene-expression\nprofile that permits the classification of tumors into subtypes and gives a score for the risk of\nrecurrence  ROR  at 10 years  The primary objective of this multicenter study was to evalu-\nate the impact of Prosigna’s assay information on physicians’ adjuvant treatment decisions\nin patients with early-stage breast cancer  Secondary objectives were to assess confidence\nof practitioners in their therapeutic recommendations before and after the added information\nprovided by the Prosigna assay  and to evaluate the emotional state of patients before and\nafter the Prosigna test results \n\nMethods\nConsecutive patients with invasive early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective \nobservational  multicenter study carried out in 8 hospitals in France  The Prosigna test was\ncarried out on surgical specimens using the nCounter® Analysis System located at the\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0185753 October 18  2017 1 /

fewer intermediate-risk  and 1 fewer high-risk tumors\n\nrelative to the central laboratory \n\nDiscussion\nWhile adjuvant chemotherapy is proven to provide an average survival gain for the population\n\nof postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- breast tumors  individuals may vary in their\n\nprognosis and how much gain they will derive from adjuvant chemotherapy  The addition of\n\nadjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in these patients provides an average of<5%\n\nincrease in 15-year survival  Some patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy benefit  but\n\nsome will undergo a treatment with risk of toxicities  A tumor biomarker assay is useful if it\n\nidentifies a group of patients for whom the absolute benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could\n\nnot exceed 2% to 3%  which is roughly equal to the risk of serious toxicities  For example  a\n\npatient with a grade 1  ER positive  progesterone receptor-positive  HER2-negative breast can-\n\ncer has a 10-year ROR of approximately 10% to 15%  adjuvant endocrine therapy would\n\nreduce this risk by approximately one-third to one-half  Assuming that adjuvant chemother-\n\napy will further reduce her ROR by approximately one-third  a recommendation for treatment\n\nto similar patients will only benefit 2% to 3%  the same number who will be harmed by toxici-\n\nties of therapy [9] \n\nThis study was designed to evaluate the influence on risk assessment and subsequent adju-\n\nvant treatment recommendations of information provided by Prosigna Gene Signature assay\n\nadded to clinicopathological factors  Risk assessment and use of adjuvant therapy has been\n\nshown to vary between institutions  regions  and countries [27]  [28]  One of the reasons for\n\nresearch in biomarkers and related risk algorithms is reduce uncertainty in risk assessments so\n\nthat patients can anticipate and experience a consistent and reliable approach to initial breast\n\ncancer management regardless of the care setting  or who they see \n\nIn the present study  205 postmenopausal women with ER positive  HER2 negative  and\n\nnode negative stage 1 or 2 tumors were enrolled at 8 centers throughout France  The study was\n\ncoordinated by the Institut Curie  In this study  physicians’ determination of intrinsic tumor\n\nsubtypes changed notably with the availability of the Prosigna test results  largely driven by re-\n\nclassification of Luminal A tumors to Luminal B tumors  This demonstrates that IHC-based\n\nsubtype classification is suboptimal and can contribute to a misestimation of a patient’s risk \n\nIn addition  recent results demonstrated no benefit of chemotherapy in Luminal A patients\n\n[29]  therefore  correct determination of tumor subtype can contribute to the decision to spare\n\nunnecessary chemotherapy  Concordance between the physicians’ post-Prosigna test determi-\n\nnation of intrinsic tumor subtypes and the Prosigna assay results was 95%  indicating that phy-\n\nsicians strongly agreed with the Prosigna test results after being made aware of them  and\n\nsignifying that they recognize the importance of the Prosigna test results for their decision\n\nmaking in this setting \n\nDuplication of Prosigna testing at the replication laboratory demonstrated excellent repro-\n\nducibility of test results  indicating that the Prosigna test is reliable when performed at local\n\ninstitutions without the need for a central laboratory  These “real-life” concordance results\n\nconfirmed the Prosigna analytical validation study results  Very few discordances were\n\nobserved  for which the clinical impact was limited  mainly resulting from tumor heterogeneity\n\n[30] \n\nCompared to the physicians’ assessments  the Prosigna assay categorized more patients as\n\nhaving a high risk of 10-year distant recurrence  3 6% by the physicians  20 6% by Prosigna\n\nFrench decision impact study of Prosigna® Test in early-stage breast

test\n\nresults  The decision of whether to or not to offer adjuvant chemotherapy is highly dependent\n\non the patient population and study center where the patient is seen before the genomic test is\n\nperformed  Importantly  patients in this decision impact study were enrolled consecutively by\n\nthe study investigators  thus eliminating the potential for physician bias in selecting only\n\npatients whose treatment is uncertain  In this study the availability of Prosigna test results led\n\nto an increase in recommendations for chemotherapy  as patients were more accurately char-\n\nacterized by genomic testing  ROR and molecular subtype  potentially contributing to a reduc-\n\ntion in the rate of early recurrence \n\nPhysicians changed their recommendations for adjuvant treatment for 18% of patients \n\nwith the proportion varying by Prosigna test risk strata  The highest proportion of changes in\n\nplanned adjuvant treatment occurred in the Prosigna test high-risk group  in which 38% of\n\npatients had their regimen switched  from No Adjuvant Chemotherapy to Adjuvant Chemo-\n\ntherapy or vice versa  The rate of change was 8% for patients in the low-risk strata and 18%\n\nfor patients in the intermediate-risk strata \n\n For patients in intermediate risk groups  the decision regarding chemotherapy is\n\nessentially made based upon molecular subtype  as per Prosigna  and clinical patient\n\ncharacteristics \n\nAs in previous studies  availability of the Prosigna test results increased physicians’ confi-\n\ndence in their treatment decisions  in 39% of cases in the present study  42% and 89% in the\n\nSpanish and German studies  respectively  indicating the value to physicians of knowing both\n\nROR score and molecularly based intrinsic subtype for decision making in this setting  Consis-\n\ntent with the physicians’ confidence in the Prosigna test results  receipt of these results caused\n\nphysicians to change their adjuvant treatment plans for 18% of patients in this study  20% and\n\n18% in the Spanish and German studies  respectively \n\nThe availability of Prosigna test results decreased patients’ anxiety about the chosen adju-\n\nvant therapy  and improved emotional well-being and several components of the DCS  which\n\nmeasures personal perceptions of uncertainty in choosing options  This demonstrates that the\n\nProsigna test results have an overall positive psychosocial impact on patients \n\nLimitations\nOf the 210 patients enrolled  approximately 150 to 170 provided data on measures of health-\n\nrelated quality of life  Missing quality of life data has been acknowledged as a challenge in can-\n\ncer trials [31]  In this study  patients were enrolled sequentially  decreasing the likelihood for\n\nselection bias \n\nMultigene molecular tests are becoming generally accepted in medical practice to tailor\n\nadjuvant treatment and evaluate prognosis in women with ER+ breast cancer  A number of\n\nsuch assays are commercially available  and are supported by ample evidence and endorsement\n\nin major guidelines  Each of the assays relies upon a different set of genes  and so may yield dif-\n\nferent results  Going forward  it will be important to monitor and compare experiences using\n\nthe various assays as more patients are diagnosed and new treatments are introduced \n\nConclusions\nThe results of this multicenter French study are consistent with previous reports of identically\n\ndesigned studies carried out by the GEICAM group in Spain [16]  and the West German Study\n\nGroup [17]  As in these 2 previous studies  the present study supported the utility of the Pro-\n\nsigna test in providing information that physicians value and incorporate into their clinical\n\ndecision-making process  Availability of the Prosigna test results increased physician confidence\n\nFrench decision impact study of Prosigna® Test in early-stage breast cancers\n\nPLOS

Mohammad Taghi Ayatollahi\nDepartment of Biostatistics  School of Medicine  Shiraz University of Medical Sciences  Shiraz  Iran\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDespite advances in cancer treatment  breast cancer is the sec-\nond leading cause of mortality among women [1]  The most com-\nmonly diagnosed cancer in Western women is breast cancer  which \naffects approximately 1 7 million women annually worldwide [2] \n\nBreast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer among Iranian \n\nwomen  and accounts for 24 6% of all cancers [3]  Research has \nshown that breast cancer affects Iranian women at least a decade \nsooner than their counterparts in developed countries  with the \nmean age ranging from 47 1 to 48 8 years [4] \n\nThe incidence of breast cancer has slowed down in developed \ncountries  but in many developing countries  it has rapidly increased \nin the past few decades [5]  \n\nThe World Health Organization reported that the incidence of \nbreast cancer increased by more than 20% between 2008 and 2012  \nand that mortality increased by 14% within the same period [6]  \nThe 5-year survival rate in Western countries has been estimated \nto be around 89% [6]  while this rate has been reported to be 70  \n89 and 58% in the Iranian cities of Shiraz  Tehran  and Semnan  \nrespectively [5]  Recent studies have investigated prognostic fac-\ntors associated with survival time  These factors include the stage \nof the disease  nodal status  tumor size  tumor grade  type of tumor  \ntumor histology  the number of involved nodes  the presence of \nlymphatic or vascular invasion  hormone receptor status  human \n\nOBJECTIVES  A survival analysis of breast cancer patients in southern Iran according to age has yet to be conducted  This study \naimed to quantify the factors contributing to a poor prognosis  using Cox and empirical Bayesian additive hazard  EBAH  models  \namong young  20-39 years  middle-aged  40-64 years  and elderly  ≥ 65 years  women \n\nMETHODS  Data from 1 574 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2012 in the cancer registry of Fars Province  south-\nern Iran  were stratified into 3 age groups  The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the overall survival rates  Cox and \nEBAH models were applied to each age category  and the Akaike information criterion was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of \nthe 2 hazard models \n\nRESULTS  As of December 2012  212 women  13 5%  in our study population had died  of whom 43 were young  15 3%  134 \nmiddle-aged  11 8%  and 35 elderly  22 3%  The 5-year survival probability by age category was 0 83  standard error [SE]  0 03  \n0 88  SE  0 01  and 0 75  SE  0 04  respectively \n\nCONCLUSIONS  The Nottingham Prognostic Index was the most effective prognostic factor  The model based on Bayesian \nmethodology performed better with various sample sizes than the Cox model  which is the most widely used method of survival \nanalysis \n\nKEY WORDS  Breast

chemotherapy \n\nWe categorized breast cancer patients into young women  20-39 \nyears  middle-aged women  40-64 years  and elderly women  65 \nyears and older  then analyzed each group separately \n\nThe survival time of each patient was determined as the differ-\nence in time  years  between the date of initial diagnosis until the \ndate of expiry through breast cancer or the end of follow-up  The \ncensoring mechanism in this study was generalized type I censor-\ning  all patients had to be present until the end of the study  and \nno cases were lost to follow-up \n\nPrognostic

vascular in-\nvolvement  involved  or free of involvement  and the NPI on the \nsurvival time of breast cancer patients in 3 age groups  The age at \ndiagnosis was a continuous variable  Stage at diagnosis was classi-\nfied as stage I  stage II  including stage IIA and IIB  and stage III \n including stage IIIA  IIIB  and IIIC  The tumor  node  metastasis \nstaging system was used to divide the patients into stages  and no \nstage IV patients were present  Nodal status was classified into 3 \ncategories depending on the number of nodes involved  0  1-3  or \n> 3  Tumor size was classified as   5 cm  The nuclear \ngrade was classified into 3 stages  well differentiated  poorly differ-\nentiated  and undifferentiated  The NPI is a numerical value com-\nputed by adding the measure of tumor diameter  multiplied by a \ncoefficient of 0 2  nodal status  1-3  and nuclear grade  1-3  The \nNPI is divided into 3 classifications  corresponding to good  mod-\nerate  and poor prognostic groups    5 4  re-\nspectively  [14]  Some variables  such as stage of diagnosis  nodal \nstatus  tumor size  and nuclear grade were not entered into the fi-\nnal model to avoid the problem of multicollinearity \n\nStatistical analysis\nThe 5-year survival of the patients with breast cancer belonging \n\nto 3 age groups  young  middle-aged  and elderly women  was cal-\nculated by the Kaplan-Meier method  In this study  we used Cox \nand EBAH models to examine the prognostic factors influencing \npatients’ survival time \n\nThe variables of age  skin involvement  estrogen receptor status  \nprogesterone receptor status  lymphatic involvement  perineural \ninvolvement  resected margin involvement  deep margin involve-\nment  vascular involvement  and the NPI were chosen to be en-\ntered into the final model using univariate Cox regression analy-\nsis  Disease stage had a strong correlation with nodal status  and \nas a result this variable was not used in the final model \n\nThe proportional hazard assumptions of the Cox model were \nchecked on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals and confirmed for all \npredictor variables  The regression parameters  β  in Cox models \n\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 status  the Nottingham Prog-\nnostic Index  NPI  and age [5 7-13]  The NPI is a numerical value \nthat is computed by adding the values of tumor size  multiplied by \na coefficient of 0 2  nuclear grade  1-3  and nodal status  1-3  \nThe original NPI used a system that was divided into 3 categories  \ncorresponding to good  moderate  and poor prognoses according \nto cut-off points of   5 4  respectively [14] \n\nStudies from various countries have shown that breast cancer is \nan aggressive disease that is especially difficult to control in young \nwomen  who have poorer survival than older patients  They are \nalso at a higher risk of death than middle-aged women [7]  \n\nAnnually  breast cancer incidence rates for women below the \nage of 40 and 40-49 years have increased since 1995 by 2 1 and \n2 4%  respectively  The relative 10-year survival rate for women \naged 50-69 years increased from 53% in 1975 to 75% in 2004 [11] \n\nA study of outcomes according to age found that breast cancer \nin elderly patients was associated with an inferior prognosis in com-\nparison to that of middle-aged women [15] \n\nThe majority of previous studies have analyzed survival data us-\ning the most widely used method  Cox regression analysis  they \nhave not generally used Bayesian methodology due to its complex \ntheoretical underpinnings  In addition  evaluating the covariates’ \neffects on absolute changes in the survival function has been a sub-\nject of interest for many researchers  which has led researchers to \nlook for alternative models where an additive hazard regression \nmodel might be appropriate [16]  The objective of the present study \nwas to determine potential prognostic factors in 3 age categories \nby using Cox and empirical Bayesian additive hazard  EBAH  mod-\nels  and then to compare them using goodness-of-fit criteria such \nas the Akaike information criterion  AIC  The outcomes of our \nstudy will help health organizations to develop interventional pro-\ngrams for breast cancer patients \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy setting\nAccording to the latest Iranian national census  Iran has a pop-\n\nulation of about 79 926 270 corresponding to 1 08% of the total \nworld population [17]  Most studies relating to breast cancer have \nbeen conducted in the capital city  Tehran  The present study was \nconducted in Shiraz  the capital of Fars Province  which is located \nin the southwest of Iran and has a population of 4 851 274 people \n[17]  The data were collected from the Nemazi Hospital  the oldest \ncancer registry office in southern Iran  which was established in \nShiraz in 1971 [18] \n\nData source and subjects\nCancer patients were registered at the Nemazi Hospital  For our \n\nstudy  we collected data from January 2002 through December \n2012  After excluding patients with other kinds of cancer and in-\ncomplete data  a total of 1 574 patients were included in this study  \nPatients’ medical records included skin involvement  estrogen re-\nceptor status  progesterone receptor status  the total number of af-\n\n\n\nNematollahi S et al    Comparison of breast cancer survival among 3 age groups\n\nwww e-epih org    |  3\n\ncan be interpreted as the logarithm of the hazard ratio  HR  for \nevery unit increment of the corresponding covariate x \n\nEBAH model  \nh t|X = h0 t  + β1X1 + … + βpXp = h0 t  + β´X\n\nCox regression hazard model \nh t|X = h0 t  exp β1X1 + … + βpXp = h0 t  exp β´X \n\nIn contrast to the Cox model  which estimates HRs  an additive \nhazard regression model estimates the differences in HR h t | x1  \n– h t | x2 = βT x1 − x2  and the survival ratio  SR  S t | x1 /S t | \nx2 = exp{−tβT x1 − x2 } for 2 subjects  Therefore  when the at-\ntribute risk or SR is of primary interest  or the proportional haz-\nard assumption is violated  an additive hazard regression model \nmay be more appropriate  Bayesian survival analysis consists of \ndata and prior information  it generates conclusions based on the \nsynthesis of new information from observed data and historical \nknowledge  Bayesian inference can be performed either with a \nfull Bayesian or empirical Bayesian posterior analysis  Empirical \nBayesian methods are procedures for statistical inference in which \nthe prior distribution is estimated from the data  while in full Baye-\nsian methods the prior distribution is fixed before any data are ob-\nserved  Therefore  the full Bayesian method is appropriate when \none has complete and precise prior information  otherwise  the \nempirical Bayesian method is advised  Model estimation and in-\nference in the full Bayesian approach is based on Markov-chain \nMonte Carlo simulations  The empirical Bayesian method for pa-\nrameter estimation in additive hazard regression models is based \non the mixed model representation of penalized regression mod-\nels with inferences based on penalized maximum likelihood and \nmarginal likelihood estimation  a generalization of restricted max-\nimum likelihood estimation  In fact  additive models can always \nbe expressed as a generalized linear mixed model  GLMM  Based \non the GLMM representation  regression and variance parame-\nters can be estimated using iteratively weighted least squares and \napproximate marginal or restricted maximum likelihood techni-\nques  which were developed for GLMMs [16] \n\nA full discussion can be found in the methodology manual of \nthe open-source statistical package Bayes X  \n\nKaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed us-\ning SPSS version 23  IBM Corp  Armonk  NY  USA  and the EBAH \nmodel was fitted by Bayes X version 2 1  German Research Foun-\ndation  Munich  Germany \n\nRESULTS\n\nAs of December 2012  212 women  13 5%  in our study popu-\nlation had died as a result of breast cancer  of whom 43 were aged \n20-39 years  15 3%  134 were aged 40-64 years  11 8%  and 35 \nwere aged ≥ 65 years  22 3% \n\nThe characteristics of the study subjects in the 3 age categories \nare presented in Table 1  The mean age of the patients at the time \n\nof diagnosis was 34 72  50 36  and 72 10 years in the young  mid-\ndle-aged  and elderly women  respectively  The most frequent age \ncategory was that of middle-aged patients  who comprised 72 2% \nof the sample  Most frequently  the women in all 3 age groups had \nstage II breast cancer as their primary diagnosis  44 5  44 4  and \n47 8% in young  middle-aged  and elderly patients  The mean tu-\nmor size was 3 03 cm in the young patients  which was greater \nthan the other 2 age groups  The plurality of the patients in each \nage group had no lymph node involvement  45 6  51 6  and 50 3% \nin young  middle-aged  and elderly patients  respectively  alth-\nough in younger women the proportion of patients with > 3 in-\nvolved nodes was larger than in the other 2 age groups  Most pa-\ntients in each age group did not have skin  vascular  or perineural \ninvolvement  and the majority of patients in all 3 groups had hor-\nmonal receptor-positive tumors  The most frequent nuclear grade \nin the 3 age groups was poorly differentiated  52 0  52 0  and 55 4% \nin young  middle-aged  and elderly patients  respectively  Most of \nthe patients had lymphatic  resected margin  and deep margin in-\nvolvement  The NPI was moderate in 48 0% of the young women  \nwhile 32 7 and 19 3% of patients had good and poor prognoses  \nrespectively  In the middle-aged women  49 2% had a moderate \nNPI  while 35 1 and 15 7% had good and poor prognoses  respec-\ntively  The NPI of 45 3% of the elderly patients was moderate  while \n36 9 and 17 8% had good and poor prognoses  respectively \n\nThe 5-year survival probability after the breast cancer diagnosis \nwas estimated to be 0 83  standard error [SE]  0 03  0 88  SE  0 01  \nand 0 75  SE  0 04  in young  middle-aged  and elderly women  \nrespectively \n\nThe survival rate of young women was non-significantly differ-\nent from that of the elderly group  but significantly lower than that \nof the middle-aged group  Figure 1A \n\nThe NPI is one of the most important grading systems  and in \nthis study  it was confirmed to be one of the most effective prog-\nnostic factors for predicting the survival of the breast cancer pa-\ntients in the 3 different age groups  The survival of patients with a \ngood NPI prognosis was similar in the 3 age groups  but the be-\ntween-group differences increased in patients in all 3 groups with \na moderate or poor NPI  Figure 1B-1D \n\nCox regression analysis showed that age at the time of diagno-\nsis  HR  0 88  p= 0 001  and the NPI  HR  5 26  p= 0 006  were \nsignificantly associated with survival time in young women

p= 0 03  and the NPI  SR  0 43  p= 0 002 and SR  0 19  \np  0 05 for all  The estimates of the HR and SR associated \nwith significant prognostic factors in both hazard models indicate \nthat the risk of mortality decreased with an increased age at diag-\nnosis in young patients  but increased in middle-aged patients  In \nother words  the effect of age at diagnosis in young and middle-\naged patients was opposite  The risk of death in middle-aged pa-\ntients with skin involvement was significantly greater than in those \nwithout skin involvement  The survival rate in patients with peri-\nneural involvement and progesterone receptor negativity was low-\ner  NPI affected patients’ survival rate in all 3 age groups  but it had \nthe strongest effect in the elderly group  Table 2 \n\nWhen comparing the results of the 2 hazard models  we observed \nthat the Cox regression analysis and EBAH models showed simi-\nlar significant prognostic factors  so we computed the AIC as a \ngoodness-of-fit criterion and compared them  The AIC values of \nthe EBAH model were lower than those of the Cox regression anal-\nysis model  so we concluded that the model based on Bayesian \nmethodology was more suitable for survival analysis with differ-\nent sample sizes  Table 2 \n\nIn addition  a comparison of the SR and HR formulas showed \nthat there were differences in the positive and negative signs in the \nexponential term  which is why the directions of the SR and HR \nwere different  \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nGlobally  the surge in breast cancer incidence and mortality rep-\nresents a significant and growing threat for developing countries  \nIn this study  our aim was to compare the Cox proportional haz-\nard and EBAH models for survival data related to 1 574 women \ndiagnosed with breast cancer divided into 3 groups of young  mid-\ndle-aged  and elderly patients  These 2 models consider different \nrelationships between the hazard and covariates  No previous stud-\nies have analyzed survival data using an EBAH model  In this pa-\nper  the covariates that were selected to remain in the final model \nwere similar in these 2 models for the 3 age categories  The signs \nof the estimated coefficients in the 2 models were also similar  but \ntheir coefficients were different in magnitude  This is not surpris-\ning  because the coefficients of Cox models are related to risk ra-\ntios  while those of EBAH models are related to risk differences \n[19] \n\nIn Western countries  the majority of breast cancer patients are \nwomen aged between 60 and 70  but in this study  most patients \nwere middle-aged  Previous studies have shown that young wom-\nen had poorer survival than other age groups [20]  In our study  \nelderly patients had a lower chance of survival than the other 2 age \n\n\n\nNematollahi S et al    Comparison of breast cancer survival among 3 age groups\n\nwww e-epih org    |  5\n\nTable 2  Results of Cox regression analysis and the

women with breast cancer in this \ngroup was lower \n\nPoor survival can be explained by the absence of or inadequate \naccess to early diagnosis and treatment \n\nOur study demonstrated that the NPI was the most effective \nprognostic factor in our study  this prognostic factor was the only \none predictive of survival in elderly patients  Our findings concur \nwith those of several studies carried out in different parts of the \nworld [8 13 21 22] \n\nIn the present study  the 5-year overall survival rate of young \npatients was 83 0% which is higher than was reported in Uganda \n 56 0%  in 2008  China  76 5%  and Taiwan  78 4%  In the mid-\ndle-aged patients  this rate has been estimated to be 88 0%  which \nis lower than has been reported in Sweden  89 0%  and equal to \nwhat has been reported in the US  88 0%  In elderly patients  this \nrate was 75 0%  which is less than has been reported in South Ko-\nrea  83 5%  North Vietnam  85 1%  Sweden  89 0%  Canada \n 86 0%  and the US  88 0%  These differences are attributable to \nvariations in lifestyle and environmental exposure  Progesterone \nreceptor positivity was an important prognostic factor for survival \nin middle-aged women with breast cancer in this study  Recent \nstudies have shown that testing for progesterone receptor status \nhelped doctors to choose the best treatment method and reduced \nbreast cancer mortality [23 24]  \n\nIn consistent associations between the survival rate and skin in-\nvolvement have been reported in studies conducted around the \nworld [10 13 21]  Our study found a negative effect of skin involve-\nment status on the survival of middle-aged women  but no effect \non the survival rates of young or elderly patients \n\nAnother important prognostic factor in young and middle-aged \npatients was age at diagnosis  In young patients  those who were \nyounger at diagnosis showed a poorer prognosis  but increased \nage increased the risk of death in middle-aged patients  This result \nin middle-aged women is consistent with the results of previous \nstudies [10 13 21]  Perineural invasion is the process of neoplastic \ninvasion of the nerves  it has been rarely observed in mammary \ncarcinoma  and therefore has not been studied extensively  In the \npresent study  it was not a significant prognostic factor in young \nand elderly breast cancer patients  but perineural involvement was \nassociated with poor survival in the middle-aged patients  A pre-\nvious study showed that perineural invasion did not affect survival \noutcomes [25]  while another study concluded that it did affect \nbreast cancer patients’ survival rate [26] \n\nSome strengths of our study include there porting of HRs and \nSRs calculated using 2 different survival models  We compared 2 \nsurvival models with different sample sizes in order to provide in-\nformation helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of patients in \ndifferent age categories

the\nbreast-conserving surgery rate is increasing  mastectomy and\naxillary surgery are still the main strategies for operable locally\nadvanced breast cancer  To improve disease control and survival \na multidisciplinary approach that includes chemotherapy \nradiotherapy  endocrine therapy  and targeted therapy are\nnecessary \nIt is now well-known that radiotherapy after mastectomy\n\ndecreases the 10-year recurrence rate by 10 6% and 20-year\nbreast cancer-related death by 8 1% in node-positive breast\ncancer patients [2] Adjuvant radiotherapy performed after\nchemotherapy is currently recommended because concurrent\nchemoradiotherapy did not show anobvious curative effect[3 4]\n\nand may increase severe adverse reactions [4–7] Nevertheless  the\nbest sequence of postoperative chemoradiotherapy is still unclear \nDelayed radiotherapy may increase the risk of local recur-\n\nrence [8] Livi et al[9]showed that the timing of radiotherapy did\nnot affect local recurrences  For

decreased time to recurrence and\npoorer overall survival1  2  The signiﬁcance of the association\nbetween obesity and metastatic recurrence is highlighted by the\nfact that >90% of breast cancer mortality is attributable to\nmetastasis  However  the multifactorial nature of obesity has\nmade it difﬁcult to establish cause and effect relationships with\nrespect to breast cancer pathophysiology  Proposed mechanisms\ninclude obesity-associated increases in circulating levels of\ninsulin  insulin like growth factor 1 or inﬂammatory cytokines/\nadipokines released from adipose-inﬁltrating immune cells or\nadipose itself3  For estrogen receptor alpha  ERα -positive breast\ncancer  the local production of estrogens  17-β estradiol or\nestrone  by aromatase expressed in adipose tissue is likely to be a\ncontributing factor  Elevated cholesterol is a comorbidity of\nobesity4–6  generating the postulate that cholesterol may mediate\nsome of the pro-metastatic effects of obesity  Epidemiologic\ndata regarding cholesterol and breast cancer onset are\ncontroversial  and it is not clear whether total  LDL or HDL\ncholesterol impart risk7–9  Studies investigating the correlation\nbetween patients taking inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl\n\ncoenzyme A reductase  statins and risk of onset are equally\nconﬂicting  with the largest meta-analyses indicating that there\nis no association10  However  there is strong clinical evidence\nsupporting a role for cholesterol in breast cancer recurrence and\nsurvival  Elevated total cholesterol is associated with increased\nbreast cancer recurrence11  Further  several retrospective studies\nindicate patients taking statins  demonstrate a signiﬁcantly\nincreased time to breast cancer recurrence12–14  Finally  in a\nrecently published phase III  double-blind trial including\n8010 postmenopausal women with early-stage  hormone\nreceptor-positive invasive breast cancer  it was found that taking\ncholesterol lowering medication during endocrine therapy was\nassociated with increased recurrence-free survival time and\ndistant recurrence–free interval15  Considering these observa-\ntions  we hypothesized that cholesterol is a mediator of some of\nthe effects of obesity on breast cancer metastasis \nPreviously we have shown that a high-cholesterol diet\n\ncan increase the growth of ER-positive tumors in the murine\nMMTV-PyMT model  and that statin treatment could attenuate\nthe effects of a high-fat diet on E0771 tumor growth16 \nNotable was the observation that the primary metabolite

Supplementary Fig  14  These effects were corroborated\nusing the E0771 model in mice void of γδ-T cells  Tcrdtm1/mom/J \nalso known as TCRD−/−   Fig  4j  Interestingly  and in support\nof our co-culture assays  we found that 27HC failed to increase\nγδ-T cells in the absence of PMNs  while it continued to promote\nan increase of PMNs in the metastatic lungs of mice immune\ndepleted of γδ-T cells  Supplementary Fig  15  This would\nindicate that PMNs are the primary effector cells of 27HC and\nthat γδ-T cells are ‘‘responding cells’’ the presence of which are\nrequired for the full effects of 27HC  Previous studies have shown\nthat metastasis-associated PMNs have an increased expression of\nProk2  NOS2  S100A8 and S100A933  When bone marrow\nderived PMNs were cultured  27HC modestly induced the mRNA\nexpression of Prok2 and NOS2  while having no effect on S100A8\nor S100A9  Supplementary Fig  16  Likewise  27HC did not\nsigniﬁcantly regulate the expression of these genes in splenocytes\n p> 0 05  SNK test  However  when PMNs were co-cultured with\nsplenocytes  similar to Fig  4a  the induction of Prok2 and NOS2\nby 27HC was signiﬁcantly enhanced  and S100A8 and S100A9\nwere now both induced  p< 0 05  SNK test  The enhanced\ninduction of these genes was not apparent when splenocytes from\nTCRD−/− mice were co-cultured with wild-type bone marrow\n Supplementary Fig  16  Collectively  this data suggests that\n27HC results in increased PMNs at the metastatic site  but that\nγδ-T cells are required for their full pro-tumorigenic properties \nHowever  further experimentation is now required to test this\nmodel and determine the precise interactions between PMNs and\nγδ-T cells \nImmune depletion of CD8+ T cells resulted in increased basal\n\ncolonization which 27HC did not increase further  Fig  4k \nTherefore  it is likely that through its actions on PMNs and/or\nγδ-T cells  27HC suppresses cytotoxic CD8+ cells  thereby\nallowing cancer cells to escape immune surveillance at distal\nmetastatic sites  Highlighting the clinical relevance of our ﬁndings\nare data from the TCGA  which indicates that in patients with\nlow tumoral CYP7B1  and thus expected elevated 27HC  there is\nincreased expression of the granulocyte marker CD66b and the\nPMN polarizing factor IL-17  Fig  4l  On the other hand  low\nCYP7B1 expression is also associated with decreased expression\nof CD3e and perforin  markers of T-cell inﬁltration and cytotoxic\nactivity  respectively \n\n27HC increases metastasis of other solid tumor types  The\nresults presented thus far suggest that the effects of 27HC on\nmetastasis are due in large part to its actions on host cells  Thus \nwe speculated that the pro-metastatic effects of 27HC may also\nincrease metastasis of cancer cells other than those derived from\nbreast tumors  Using i v  injection of cancer cells as a model of\nmetastasis  it was determined that 27HC pretreatment increased\nthe number of metastatic nodules in the lungs when syngeneic\ncolorectal cancer cells  MC38  lung cancer cells  Lewis Lung \nmelanoma  B16-F0  or pancreatic cells  KPC915  were injected\n Supplementary Fig  17  Increased colonization of pancreatic\ncancer cells to the heart and liver  or melanoma cells to the liver \nwere also observed in 27HC-treated mice  Further  the number\nof nodules formed after injection of colorectal cancer cells into\nwild-type mice was signiﬁcantly higher than in mice that lack\nthe ability to synthesize 27HC  CYP27A1−/− mice  p= 0 03 \nConsidering these studies performed in well-validated models  it\nis concluded that cholesterol  secondary to its conversion to\n27HC  is likely to impact metastasis of a broad range of tumor\ntypes  a result that highlights the importance of this axis as a\ntherapeutic target \n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI  10 1038/s41467-017-00910-z ARTICLE\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |8   864 |DOI  10

recurrence in breast\ncancer patients  while statins have been shown to signiﬁcantly\nimprove prognosis  Although several studies have indicated\nthat ‘‘Western diets’’ high in both fat and cholesterol increase\nmammary cancer metastasis8  the speciﬁc contributions of\ncholesterol in this process have not been evaluated  Therefore \nusing clinically relevant murine models of breast cancer  we show\nthat  1  elevated cholesterol alone can increase metastasis   2  the\nmetastatic effects of obesity are mediated in part by elevations in\ncholesterol  and  3  statin intervention can attenuate the effects of\na high-fat diet  Furthermore  it was determined that the effect of\ndietary cholesterol on metastasis requires CYP27A1  the enzyme\nresponsible for the synthesis of 27HC  In support of the idea that\nthe 27HC signaling axis mediates the effects of cholesterol  it was\nshown that exogenous supplementation with 27HC robustly\nincreased lung metastasis from tumors and colonization from i v \ngrafts  It is important to note that although our studies implicate\n27HC as a mediator of the pro-metastatic actions of cholesterol\nthey do not rule out the possibility that other metabolites\nof 27HC  such as cholestenoic acid  may also be involved \nFurthermore  we have not investigated how 27HC\ntreatment might also alter other metabolites  in particular\ncholesterol-5 6-epoxides  These epoxides have been shown have\nanti-tumor properties  and in fact tamoxifen is a ligand for the\nenzyme responsible for their synthesis  cholesterol\nepoxide hydrolase  ChEH  Treatment of breast cancer cells with\ntamoxifen leads to the accumulation cholesterol-5 6α-epoxide \ncontributing to the efﬁcacy of this drug37  Furthermore \ncholesterol-5 6α-epoxide can react with histamine to form\ndendrogenin A  a metabolite with tumor-suppressing activity24 \nTherefore  it will be important for future studies to consider the\ncomplete cholesterol-homeostatic landscape \nWe and others have shown previously that 27HC can function\n\nas an endogenous SERM38  39  In models of the cardiovascular\nsystem  for instance  27HC behaves as an ER-antagonist  while it\nfunctions as a partial agonist in osteoblasts and in ER-positive\nbreast cancer cells39–42  In animal models of ER-positive breast\ncancer  the partial agonist activity of 27HC is sufﬁcient to support\ntumor growth16  17  It has also been demonstrated that 27HC\ncan function as a robust LXR agonist and that similar to other\nsynthetic LXR agonists it induces the expression of markers of the\nepithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells  EMT \n16  40  43  However  induction of this program by pretreating cells\nwith 27HC prior to their engraftment in mice  resulted in a very\nmodest increase in metastasis as compared to that which was\nobserved when cells were engrafted into 27HC pretreated\nmice  ref  16 and Fig  2a  Thus  although 27HC can induce\nthe expression of some of the key markers of EMT  it is likely that\nthe cancer cell extrinsic actions of 27HC are most important in\nfacilitating metastasis  Indeed  the pro-metastatic activities of\n27HC were readily apparent in studies designed to isolate the\nactivities of this oxysterol to the host  Although subtle  an\nincreased metastatic burden was observed in mice grafted i v  with\ncancer cells and subsequently treated with 27HC in a chronic\nmanner  We believe that this may represent the promotion of\n‘‘secondary’’ seeding events  This observation is signiﬁcant as it\nsuggests that inhibition of 27HC synthesis or action may be\nbeneﬁcial in patients who have already been diagnosed with\nmetastatic disease \nIn this study  it was demonstrated that the pro-metastatic\n\neffects of 27HC were entirely dependent on the presence of\nclodronate-liposome sensitive myeloid cells  which are known to\ncontribute signiﬁcantly to the metastatic process27  28  44–46  The\nrole of granulocytes in metastasis is somewhat enigmatic in that\n\nthey have been shown to have both positive and negative effects\non tumor biology  these effects being elaborated in a context\nspeciﬁc manner  However  neutrophil inﬁltration at the distal site\nhas been shown to be required for metastasis and such inﬁltration\nhas been attributed to activation of CXCR2 and resulting\ndownstream signaling events33  34  47 \nImmune cell proﬁling indicated both IMs and PMNs were\n\nincreased in the metastatic lungs of mice treated with 27HC \nSince the motility of PMNs is induced by CXCR2 signaling  and\nconsidering previous reports that oxysterols can activate CXCR2 \nwe tested the possibility that the effect of 27HC on metastasis\nresulted from its ability to activate CXCR2 in PMNs \nTwo important ﬁndings in this study support this hypothesis \n 1  a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR2 was able to ablate\nthe colonizing effects of 27HC  and  2  27HC had no effect on\ncancer cell colonization in animals in which PMNs were\nimmune-depleted  On the other hand  while depletion of IMs\nreduced basal colonization  27HC continued to promote cancer\ncell colonization under these conditions \nT-cell subtypes have been shown to have dramatic effects that\n\npromote or inhibit cancer progression  Speciﬁcally  CD4+ CD25+\n\nT-regulatory cells  or Tregs  have been shown to suppress\nanti-tumor immune responses by CD8+ T cells48  Further \nCD8+CD3+ cytotoxic T cells naturally respond to the presence of\ncancer cells and initiate apoptotic mechanisms in tumor cells \nbut their effectiveness is neutralized by host factors produced by\ncells within the tumor environment49  50  Bridging the gap\nbetween these axes are γδ T-cell receptor  TCR + CD3+ T cells  a\nrare population of T lymphocytes whose characteristics straddle\nthose of innate and adaptive immunity  These lymphocytes are\nthought to develop from the same late precursor as αβ TCR+\nT cells  but gain their speciﬁc TCRs during development in the\nthymus51  In contrast to αβ TCR+ T lymphocytes  γδ-T cells can\nbe activated through direct recognition of ligands  and can initiate\nrapid immune responses  Though earlier reports have indicated\ntheir anti-cancer activity52–54  recent reports provide compelling\narguments for their cancer-promoting role  It has been shown\nthat γδ-T cells inﬁltrate tumors  and encourage metastasis by\nsecreting IL-17  which modulates the polarization of neutrophils\nand that this results in the suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell\nproliferation and effector phenotype33  Our work suggests a\nfeed-forward mechanism whereby 27HC stimulates the recruit-\nment of PMNs which are required for the proliferative action\nof 27HC on γδ-T cells  and based on previous reports33  the\nγδ-T cells would then promote further PMN recruitment\nin addition to polarizing PMNs into an immune-suppressive\nsubtype  Although we have not speciﬁcally investigated PMN\npolarization  we did ﬁnd that the induction of certain genes\nassociated with metastasis-associated PMNs by 27HC required\nthe presence of γδ-T cells  The numbers of γδ-T cells are\nsigniﬁcantly elevated in the tumors of patients with advanced\ndisease  and elevated numbers are a marker for poor prognosis55 \nMost relevant to this study  is the ability of γδ-T cells to recognize\nand respond to lipid antigens56  cancer cell-derived antigens57 \nand mevalonate metabolites in tumor cells58  Our results\ndemonstrating the effect of 27HC on this T-cell population\nsupports a model whereby 27HC leads to the activation/recruit-\nment of γδ-T cells and PMNs  the activity of both cell types\nbeing ultimately responsible for the suppression of CD8+\n\ncytotoxic T cells and pro-colonizing properties of 27HC  The\nprecise molecular mechanisms by which 27HC impacts immune\nbiology in these cells remains to be determined \nHere  we show that 27HC is a major biochemical mediator of\n\nthe metastatic effects of hypercholesterolemia  Indeed  27HC is a\ncirculating metabolite that dramatically increases breast cancer\nmetastasis through its interaction with γδ-T cells and PMNs \n\nARTICLE NATURE

events involved are not yet known \n27HC has previously been shown to interact with the ERs  LXRs \nand CXCR2  Of note  a recent report indicates that ER signaling\ncan lead to altered myeloid cell inﬁltration and activity within the\novarian tumor microenvironment29  In addition  a recent report\nindicates that cholesterol is a ligand for the estrogen-related\nreceptor alpha  ERRα  and modeling would suggest that 27HC\nmight also interact with this receptor59  All four of these potential\ntargets are highly amenable to therapeutic intervention \nNotable was the observation that genetic or small molecule\ndependent inhibition of CYP27A1 signiﬁcantly reduced breast\ncancer colonization of the lungs in two clinically relevant animal\nmodels  While statin therapy may be effective in the short term  a\nrecent ‘‘window of opportunity’’ study indicated that HMG-CoA\nreductase was upregulated in tumors from patients treated with\nstatins  indicating that downstream targeting  such as CYP27A1\nor the effectors of 27HC  will likely be more efﬁcacious60 \nFurthermore  since the effects of 27HC are on the host\nenvironment  its effects are likely to be broadly applicable to all\nsolid tumors  and we present evidence that this is the case for\ncolorectal  pancreatic  melanoma  and lung cancers \n\nMethods\nReagents  27HC and GW273297X were synthesized by Sai Life  Hyderabad \nIndia

Origin\nThe authenticity of two cell lines  MDA-MB-435 and UCLA-\nSO-M14  commonly referred to as M14  has been debated\nin the scientiﬁc literature over many years  timeline  see\nFig  1a  Questions were ﬁrst raised regarding the tissue\norigin of MDA-MB-435 in 2000  when cDNA microarray\nanalysis of the NCI-60 panel showed that the expression pat-\ntern of the claimed breast carcinoma cells closely resembled\npatterns seen in melanoma cell lines 1 Similar results were\nreported by other laboratories 2 Subsequent analysis of multi-\nple samples of MDA-MB-435 showed that cell stocks in use\nat different laboratories around the world shared common\nexpression patterns associated with melanoma 3\n\nNumerous analytical approaches  karyotyping  compara-\ntive genomic hybridization  microsatellite polymorphism\nanalysis  STR analysis  single nucleotide polymorphism  SNP \nanalysis and bioinformatics analysis of gene expression  have\ndemonstrated that the MDA-MB-435 cell line shares a com-\nmon origin with the M14 melanoma cell line 4 5 These studies\nhave concluded that MDA-MB-435 is misidentiﬁed and is in\nfact a derivative of the M14 melanoma cell line 4 6–8\n\nThis conclusion  however  has been debated on the basis\nof phenotypic evidence  MDA-MB-435 can express breast-\nspeciﬁc and epithelial-speciﬁc markers  leading to the conclu-\nsion that it is derived from breast carcinoma and that expres-\nsion of melanocyte-speciﬁc markers may be caused by lineage\ninﬁdelity 9 10 possibly as a normal property of freshly excised\nmammary tumor tissue 11\n\nThe provenance of M14 and MDA-MB-435 was reviewed in\na 2009 letter  resulting in further concerns regarding the\nauthenticity of M14 12 The letter observed that the sex of origin\nrecorded for the two cell lines is different  M14 was derived\nfrom a male and MDA-MB-435 from a female donor 13 14 Since\ncytogenetic analysis had shown that MDA-MB-435 has an\nXX karyotype  the author postulated that M14 may be the\nmisidentiﬁed cell line 12 15 However  not all evidence supports\nthis conclusion  Y-speciﬁc markers were recently detected in\nMDA-MB-435 using the SNP TraceTM System  which includes\nthree X-speciﬁc and three Y-speciﬁc SNP loci 16\n\nMDA-MB-435 Continues to be Widely Used\nas a Breast Carcinoma Model\nMDA-MB-435 and derivatives such as MDA-MB-435S\n ATCC HTB-129  a spindle-shaped variant of the parental\n\ncell line  continue to be used extensively and described as\n“breast carcinoma” in the scientiﬁc literature 6 8 For example \nin December 1992  MDA-MB-435 was added to the NCI-60\ncell line panel for use in anticancer drug screening  where it\nwas initially described as a “breast” cancer cell line 17 STR\nproﬁling of the NCI-60 panel later conﬁrmed the shared\ndonor origin of these cells with M14 5\n\nA recent search of PubMed using the search term “MDA-\nMB-435” shows that the cell line was referred to in the title or\nabstract of 1 205 publications between 1982 and 2016  MDA-\nMB-435 was described as a breast cell line in 56%  123/221  of\nrecent publications between 2013 and 2016  Fig  1b  Many\nlaboratories have used MDA-MB-435 as a breast cancer model \nbecause of its rapid growth and ability to metastasize in\nnude mice  to develop treatments for breast cancer  or to help\nunderstand how breast cancers metastasize 7\n\nPublications that cast doubt on the authenticity of M14\nare frequently cited  For example  the letter referring to the\nsex of origin of M14 and MDA-MB-43512 has been cited 159\ntimes  Web of Science  July 25  2017  It seems likely that\nongoing usage of both cell lines in the scientiﬁc literature has\nbeen inﬂuenced by the lack of resolution of the debate\nregarding the authenticity of the cell lines  Therefore  it is\nimportant to explore the origins of M14 and MDA-MB-435\nto see if this ongoing debate can now be resolved to the satis-\nfaction of the research community \n\nMaterial and Methods\nCell lines and culture conditions\n\nThe International Cell Line Authentication Committee  ICLAC \nobtained frozen samples corresponding to the M14 donor\n serum and cell lines  MDA-MB-435 and derivative MDA-MB-\n435S  Samples were used for DNA extraction or culture \n\nSamples from the donor of M14 were requested from the\nJohn Wayne Cancer Institute  JWCI  Sample Repository  The\nSample Repository informed us that serum and cell lines  but not\ntissue samples  were maintained from this donor  Samples from\nthe M14 donor were ﬁrst deposited in June 1973  The Specimen\nRepository provided the following samples for testing \n\n1  One tube of donor serum  dated December 21  1973 \n\n2  Two vials of M14  melanoma18  labeled as passage 14 and\n15  both dated December 2  1975  The M14 passage 15 vial\nwas thawed and approximately three quarters of the\nsample was used for culture  with the remainder used for\nDNA extraction  The M14 passage 14 vial was thawed and\n\nWhat’s new \n\nA variety of analytical approaches have indicated that melanoma cell line M14 and breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435\n\noriginate from a common donor  but there is ongoing debate regarding which is the misidentified cell line  Here  authentica-\n\ntion testing of M14 from 1975  prior to the establishment of MDA-MB-435  with comparison to donor serum and lymphoblas-\n\ntoid cell line ML14  shows that M14 is the authentic cell line and MDA-MB-435 is a misidentified derivative  With clear\n\nprovenance information and authentication testing of early samples  debates regarding the origins of problematic cell lines\n\nthat are widely used in cancer research can be resolved \n\nM\nol\nec\nul\nar\n\nC\nan\nce\nr\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n562 M14 and

article to describe the M14 cell line was sub-\nmitted for publication on July 7  1975 18 The donor was\nreported to be a male with blood type O 13\n\nFurther review of M14 publications showed that at

authenti-\ncation testing was performed in the 1970s using HLA analy-\nsis  showing that M14 corresponded to two synonymous cell\nlines 19 our literature analysis did not exclude the possibility\nthat

methods that might be used for sex determination \n\nM14 cells have detectable Y chromosomal\n\nmaterial by cytogenetic analysis\n\nCytogenetic analysis of the M14 cell line was undertaken to\nbetter understand the ﬁnding that MDA-MB-435 has an XX\nkaryotype 12 15 Initially  to evaluate X- and Y-chromosomal\nmaterial dual-color FISH was performed with a CEP X probe\nthat has homology to the Xp11-q11 centromeric region  rich\nin satellite I DNA  and the Yq12 probe that has homology to\nthe heterochromatic Yq12 region  rich in satellite III DNA \n\nBoth centromeric X- and Yq12-chromosomal material\nwere detected in M14  Fig  3a–3d  Interphase analysis of 100\nnuclei showed an average count of 2 4 copies per nucleus for\ncentromere X signals and 1 9 copies for Yq12 signals  Meta-\nphase analyses identiﬁed two distinct derivative chromosomes\ncarrying the Yq12 sequences  e g  Figs  3c and 3d  the\nshorter derivative being more common than the longer deriv-\native  Sequential G-banding and FISH analysis revealed the\nshorter derivative as der 22 t Y 22 q12 p11  with the Yq12\nmaterial translocated to the short arm of chromosome 22\n Figs  4a and 4c  The rare  longer derivative  also carrying\nYq12 sequences  was not present in the metaphases analyzed\nby GTL-banding and FISH \n\nTo determine whether the M14 Y/22 translocation is speciﬁc\nto that cell line  ML14 cells were examined by G-banding and\nFISH analysis  Eleven metaphases were karyotyped  representative\nimages are shown in Figures 4d–4f  FISH analysis with the CEP\nX/Yq12 probe set indicated that each metaphase of the ML14\nlymphoblastoid cell line contained a normal X chromosome  a\nderivative X chromosome with a large unknown fragment\nadded on to its short arm  and a normal Y chromosome \nMetaphases were typically tetraploid with numerous rearranged\nchromosomes \n\nMDA-MB-435S cells were also examined to conﬁrm\nﬁndings from M14  MDA-MB-435S cells displayed two X\nchromosomes and the Y/22 translocation ﬁrst seen in M14\n Supporting Information Fig  S4a  Counting of interphase\nnuclei suggested that the Y/22 translocation was present in a\nminority of cells  Supporting Information Fig  S4b \n\nOn the basis of these results  we concluded that both X-\nand Y-chromosomal material can be detected in M14 and\nits derivatives  ML14 carries a normal Y chromosome \nwhile M14 displays a Y/22 chromosomal translocation  This\ntranslocation does not appear to include amelogenin or the\nthree Y-SNP loci tested to date  Supporting Information Figs \nS1 and S3  We then performed sex-speciﬁc STR analysis to\nsee if other loci were detectable \n\nM14 cells have duplicated X chromosomal material\n\nbut lack Y-specific STR loci\n\nFor the X chromosome  four additional

already observed that three X-speciﬁc SNP loci\nwere also hemi- or homozygous  we concluded that the most\nlikely mechanism for the observed XX karyotype was X-\nchromosomal uniparental disomy  with

mutations or deletions might be\npreventing their ampliﬁcation  It is likely that apart from\nYq12  all other Y-chromosomal material has been lost from\nM14  either as part of the disease process or during cell line\nestablishment \n\nDiscussion\nAuthentication testing of M14 from 1975  prior to the establish-\nment of MDA-MB-435  with comparison to donor serum and\nlymphoblastoid cell line ML14  shows that M14 is the authentic\ncell line and MDA-MB-435 is a misidentiﬁed derivative \n\nMisidentiﬁcation of MDA-MB-435 is likely to have\noccurred prior to 1981–1982 4 The originators of both cell lines\npublished a paper together that was accepted in May 1979 35\n\nwhich suggests the possibility that each laboratory had access to\nthe other’s cell lines at that point in time  It is interesting to\nnote that derivative MDA-MB-435S was ﬁrst deposited at a cell\nbank in 1982  The deposit records from the originator noted\nthat MDA-MB-435S was similar to the original tumor until a\nspindle-shaped  faster growing cell emerged  historical deposit\ninformation  HTB-129  This comment is consistent with the\nﬁrst publication to use MDA-MB-435S  demonstrating that it\ngrew rapidly with a doubling time of 14–30 hrs 36 In retrospect \nit seems likely that this faster growing variant represented\ncross-contamination and was subsequently distributed by the\noriginator to colleagues and cell line repositories  These col-\nleagues included Dr Janet Price  who received MDA-MB-435\nfrom the originator37 and later provided it to other\nlaboratories 3 9 11 38\n\nOur results are consistent with studies performed previously \nusing STR proﬁling to examine authenticity  as well as expres-\nsion proﬁling and mutation status to examine tissue origin 1–3 32\n\nThese studies concluded that M14 was the authentic cell line and\nwas derived from melanoma  despite other studies that have\ndemonstrated expression of breast-speciﬁc markers 9–11 38\n\nExpression of markers that are inconsistent with tissue iden-\ntity has been explored previously in M14 and MDA-MB-435 2 10\n\nExpression can vary with cell density  suggesting that growth\nand assay conditions play an important role in expression of\ntissue-speciﬁc markers in cell culture 38 It should be noted that\nmelanoma can display marked phenotypic diversity  making\ndiagnosis challenging even in a clinical setting 39 Similarly  breast\ncarcinoma has been demonstrated to express melanocytic\nmarkers  with increased expression in less differentiated\ntumors 40 Lineage inﬁdelity can potentially affect both breast car-\ncinoma and melanoma cells  Phenotype may be helpful in deter-\nmining tissue origin  but is not sufﬁcient to prove cell line\nidentity  A genotype-based method of testing is essential for\nunambiguous identity determination and should be incorporated\ninto policy for authentication of human cell lines  with STR pro-\nﬁling as the consensus for comparison 22 The International Jour-\nnal of Cancer has stringent requirements for authentication\ntesting in place and this investigation demonstrates their\nimportance 41\n\nFigure 4  FISH Analysis and Karyotype of M14 and ML14

that time  made our subsequent detective work\npossible  Documentation of cell line provenance  and reten-\ntion of donor material and early passage samples are essential\nto prove authenticity  New cell lines should always have\ndonor tissue stored for testing and comparison to later pas-\nsage samples  Deposit of samples in a core facility or cell line\nrepository will ensure that valuable samples are retained for\nfuture use  Deposit of STR proﬁles into a shared database of\ncell line STR proﬁles  such as BioSample 42 is also an essential\nstep for future comparison \n\nEarly authentication testing of M14 was performed using\nHLA typing 19 Although HLA typing continues to be used\nfor authentication  it can be difﬁcult to compare early results\nbased on serology19 with later results from sequence-based\ntyping 43 STR proﬁling of early passage samples offers an\neffective solution  enabling comparison of samples from dif-\nferent laboratories  and its use as a consensus method22 has\nresulted in multiple samples for comparison  Supporting\nInformation Table S1  For example  the STR proﬁles from\nother cell lines previously reported to share a common donor\norigin with MDA-MB-435 also corresponded to serum from\nthe melanoma donor  with percent match values of 77–95%\n Supporting Information Table S1  These other lines were\npurportedly derived from papillary thyroid carcinoma and\nuveal melanoma  Supporting Information Fig  S5  Supporting\nInformation Table S1 \n\nSNP proﬁling is a complementary approach to STR analy-\nsis  although at least one incorrect allele call was detected\nhere  showing the need to optimize the SNP TraceTM System\nfor cell line analysis  Cytogenetic analysis can also be highly\ninformative  For this study  it was the only method to detect\nthe Y-chromosomal material in M14 cells \n\nConsideration of sex in the design and interpretation of pre-\nclinical studies is important and has been highlighted by NIH\nand others 44 45 Clinical outcomes in melanoma can vary with\nthe sex of the patient  suggesting that this variable is relevant\nfor melanoma research 46 Oncogenes and tumor suppressors\nare present on X and Y chromosomes  and have been proposed\nas biological mechanisms to explain the sex disparities in mela-\nnoma  For example  the TSPY oncogene on the Y chromosome\nis known to be dysregulated in some melanoma cell lines 46\n\nDonor sex is therefore relevant  but can be difﬁcult to deter-\nmine in cell lines  Loss of Y-chromosomal material is frequently\nseen in cell culture  A recent study of 1 843 human cell lines\ndemonstrated that 331 were annotated as male but called as\nfemale through absence of AMELY on STR analysis 24 Our\nanalysis of donor serum and ML14 demonstrated that M14 and\nMDA-MB-435 come from a male donor  Cytogenetic analysis\nshowed that M14 and MDA-MB-435S cells carry a derivative\nchromosome 22 from a translocation with Yq12  However

detect\nY-speciﬁc loci in either cell line \n\nThe absence of Y-speciﬁc loci suggests that the majority\nof the Y chromosome has been lost from M14 and MDA-\nMB-435 cells  Y chromosomal rearrangements may have\noccurred during cell line establishment or ongoing culture \nVariable Y-chromosome numbers have been observed while\nexamining A549 cells from different sources using cytogenetic\nanalysis 47 Y translocations have been documented in cell\nlines  for example  in prostate cell line DU 145 48 Y/22\ntranslocations can also be associated with cancer  usually in\nassociation with a variant Philadelphia chromosome 49 Loss\nof Y chromosomal material with retention of heterochromatin\nhas been seen in melanoma previously 50\n\nX-chromosomal uniparental disomy is the most likely\nmechanism for the XX karyotype previously reported for\nM14 and MDA-MB-435 12 15 Duplication of X-chromosomal\nmaterial has been demonstrated previously in male cell lines\nestablished from prostate cancer 28 Cytogenetic analysis\nshowed that ML14 cells carry X chromosomal rearrange-\nments  This is an unusual ﬁnding for lymphoblastoid cell\nlines  where tetraploidy is common  but rarely produces\ngenetic imbalances 51 Although lymphoblastoid cell lines\nfrom normal patients typically have stable karyotypes  chro-\nmosomal abnormalities have been documented in association\nwith immortalization 52\n\nWe conclude that the M14 cell line is authentic  estab-\nlished from a male donor with melanoma  Currently available\nstocks of MDA-MB-435 are misidentiﬁed and were derived\nfrom M14  Unless authentic stocks of MDA-MB-435 can be\nidentiﬁed  investigators should be aware that MDA-MB-435\n\nis not a female cell line and is not a suitable model for breast\ncarcinoma  Cell lines are living materials and can be complex \nchangeable  and difﬁcult to understand  Clear provenance\nand careful characterization of widely used cell lines  such as\nM14 and MDA-MB-435  are essential if we are to understand\nthe tumors from which they were established \n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is dedicated to Donald Morton and Eric Seelenfreund  two\naccomplished melanoma researchers who worked with M14

increased risk for devel-\nopment of breast cancer  and possibly worse outcomes \nwhen compared to nonobese patients at the time of diag-\nnosis [4–10] \n\nMoreover  it has been suggested that women

increased risk of breast cancer and worse \noutcomes at the time of diagnosis  Women tend to gain weight after breast \ncancer diagnosis and during chemotherapy for early- stage disease  which may \nin turn increase risk for worse outcomes  We examined if weight gained during \nadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with worse survival outcomes  We queried \nour database for data on patients who received adjuvant third- generation chemo-\ntherapy for early- stage breast cancer  Univariate and multivariate analyses by \nCox regression were performed for survival outcomes across three categories \naccording to BMI variation from start to end of chemotherapy  >0 5 kg/m2 loss \nor gain and stable BMI  ±0 5 kg/m2  We included 1998 patients in this study  \nWomen over 50 years old and postmenopausal were more likely to lose weight \nduring adjuvant chemotherapy  whereas women under 30 years old gained more \nweight  P  0 5 kg/m2 compared to maintaining BMI was marginally associated \nwith increased locoregional recurrence risk  HR  2 53  95% CI  1 18–5 45  \nP = 0 017  adjusting for grade  stage  and radiation delivery  Weight variation \nduring adjuvant chemotherapy for early- stage breast cancer may occur as both \nweight gain and weight loss in a balanced manner  Furthermore  this variation \nseems to be transient in nature and does not appear to significantly influence \nrecurrence rates and overall survival \n\nCancer Medicine\nOpen Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2516 © 2017 The Authors  Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd  \n\nG  Schvartsman et al Weight Gain During Adjuvant Chemotherapy\n\nDespite some efforts to address this matter  how \nweight change during adjuvant chemotherapy  when \nobserved  may affect long- term survival outcomes \nremains widely

albeit involving a large cohort of patients  war-\nrants caution in data interpretation  We had incomplete \ndata of patients’ smoking status  which has been shown \nto potentially influence outcomes when accounted for [16]  \nAdditionally  there is no clear guideline for appropriate \ncutoff selection of BMI change in this context  although \n0 5 kg/m2 has been reported previously [16]  Also  by \nexcluding patients that received neoadjuvant therapy  in \norder to standardize the sequence of treatments  we may \nhave excluded patients with more aggressive biology that \nrequired upfront systemic therapy  although the rate of \ntriple- negative breast cancer patients in our cohort was \nappropriate  The unusually low number of events overall \nin this study may have contributed to the absence of \nmore significant findings  as well as the previously reported \nassociation between obesity at diagnosis and worse out-\ncomes that were not reproduced in our study \n\nIn conclusion  our study demonstrated that weight \nvariation during adjuvant chemotherapy for early- stage \nbreast cancer may occur as both weight gain and weight \nloss in a balanced manner  Furthermore  this variation \nseems to be transient in nature and does not appear to \nsignificantly influence recurrence rates and overall \nsurvival \n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNone \n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe

that increased Twist expression\nis significantly associated with larger tumor size  lymph node involvement  higher nuclear\ngrade  and positive HER2 status \n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer incidence is high not only in Chinese women but also worldwide  and thus is\n\nranked as one of the most common cancers[1  2]  Breast cancer is categorized into different\n\nsubtypes based on the expression of various biomarkers  including estrogen receptor  ER \n\nprogesterone receptor  PR  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER2  and Ki67 \n\nExpression of these markers plays a vital role in deciding the fundamental therapeutic strategy\n\n[3]  As a result  the mortality rate associated with breast cancer has reduced due to significant\n\nprogress in early diagnosis and development of multiple treatment options  However  a signifi-\n\ncant percentage of the patient population still fails to respond to these already developed thera-\n\npies  and many patients develop metastasis  relapse  or display therapeutic resistance  Notable\n\namong them is triple-negative breast cancer  TNBC  subtype  Thus  there is an essential need\n\nto identify additional novel molecular biomarkers that have the potential to predict therapeutic\n\nvalue across multiple subtypes and serve as therapeutic targets \n\nTwist is a basic helix-loop-helix  bHLH  transcription factor that has been previously impli-\n\ncated in cell lineage determination and differentiation during embryogenesis  In recent years \n\nTwist has also been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis through triggering epithelial to mes-\n\nenchymal transition  EMT  and downregulating E-cadherin expression  thereby influencing\n\ntumor invasion  metastasis  adverse prognosis  and drug resistance in multiple tumors[4  5] \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that Twist interfered the ARF-p53 pathway to prevent c-\n\nmyc-induced apoptosis and the anti-apoptotic character of Twist was considered the reason\n\nfor metastatic process[6–9]  Twist expression has been significantly associated with invasion\n\nand metastasis of various cancers  including breast cancer[10]  non-small cell lung cancer[11] \n\nprostate cancer[12]  gastric cancer[13]  melanoma[14]  Sezary syndrome[15]  osteosarcoma\n\n[16]  and hepatocarcinoma[17]  Some studies have indicated that increased Twist expression\n\ncorrelated with worse breast cancer prognosis[18  19]  while other studies showed opposite\n\nresults[20]  Therefore  to further clarify the prognostic value of Twist in breast cancer  we con-\n\nducted a new meta-analysis to estimate the association between Twist expression and survival\n\noutcomes in breast cancer  In addition  we also assessed the correlation of Twist with clinico-\n\npathological features of breast carcinoma \n\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy\nEligible studies through June 5  2017 were identified using PubMed  Embase  the Cochrane\n\nLibrary  and Web of Science databases  The following MeSH terms were used to search rele-\n\nvant articles  “breast neoplasms” and/or “breast cancer”  and/or “Twist”  and/or “prognosis” \n\nMoreover  the reference lists of eligible studies were further searched manually to identify\n\nadditional relevant studies \n\nPrognostic value of Twist expression in breast cancer  A meta-analysis\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0186191

cancer   2  Twist expression was analyzed\n\nin all breast cancer patients  and  3  the hazard ratio  HR  with 95% confidence interval  CI \n\nwas either available or sufficient information was available to indirectly estimate it  Studies\n\nwere excluded from the meta-analysis if they were either  1  duplicate studies   2  animal or\n\ncell studies   3  HR information was not available and could not be extracted from a Kaplan-\n\nMeier curve  or  4  if they were reviews  letters  or only case reports \n\nData extraction\nData extraction from the eligible studies was performed independently by two authors  Wei-\n\nqiang Qiao and Heyang Liu  The extracted information included  author of publication  year \n\ncountry  number of patients  age  time of follow-up  clinical outcome  survival analysis  Twist\n\nexpression  detection method  its cut-off values  antibody  proportion of tumors with Twist\n\nover-expression  and correlation between Twist mRNA and protein levels  The HR informa-\n\ntion was directly recorded if present  or extracted from the Kaplan-Meier curves using\n\nEngauge Digitizer Version 4 1  http //markummitchell github io/engauge-digitizer/  software \n\nThe quality of the studies was assessed using the modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale  NOS [21] \n\nwhich classified the studies into eight categories and scored them  A score of 9 represented a\n\nmaximum score  however  a score of 7 or higher indicated high quality \n\nStatistical analysis\nThe complete meta-analysis was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\n\nReviews and Meta-analyses  PRISMA  guideline[22]  S1 File  In studies where HR value was\n\nnot available  HR was calculated from Kaplan-Meier curves  as suggested by Tierney et al [23] \nThe Cochran Q test and I2 statistics were applied to detect heterogeneity  A P value of  50% represented strong heterogeneity[24]  The fixed effects model was\n\napplied for meta-analysis if very low or no heterogeneity was observed  In contrast  the ran-\n\ndom effects model was used when notable heterogeneity existed between different studies[25] \n\nIn addition  sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the robustness of the data  The\n\nMeta-regression analysis was applied to estimate the sources of heterogeneity  Moreover \n\npotential publication bias was tested using Begg’s test[26]  Overall  all analyses were conducted\n\nusing Review Manager version 5 3  Cochrane Collaboration  Copenhagen  Denmark  and\n\nSTATA version 14 0  Stata Corporation  TX  USA  software

performed meta-regression analysis to identify variable factors influencing the associ-\n\nation of Twist expression with DFS and OS in breast cancer  However  we did not find any evi-\n\ndence of

including\n\nbreast cancer  where the results were based on data from only 2 studies  One study reported a\n\npositive association of Twist expression with worse OS in breast cancer  HR  2 34  95% CI \n\n1 72–3 20  P < 0 001 [31]  while the other reported no association  HR  1 65  95% CI  0 19–\n\n14 03  P = 0 66 [32]  Thus  these conflicting reports led us to undertake a comprehensive anal-\n\nysis  Our meta-analysis included these two studies as well as an additional five breast cancer\n\nstudies to determine if there was a significant correlation between Twist expression and breast\n\ncancer  We also included studies that specifically examined Twist mRNA expression  In addi-\n\ntion  we also examined the association between Twist expression and various breast cancer\n\nclinicopathological factors \n\nInterestingly  our results indicated that higher Twist expression was significantly associated\n\nwith worse OS in breast cancer  but showed no correlation with DFS  This result was consis-\n\ntent with a previously published study by Wushou et al [31]  which indicated that inhibitors of\nTwist can be beneficial for improving clinical outcomes in breast cancer treatment  Grzegr-\n\nzolka et al [33] demonstrated that higher nuclear Twist expression was associated with worse\nevent-free survival and poor OS in breast cancer patients  Lim et al [34] revealed that stromal\nnuclear Twist over-expression was correlated with worse prognosis in terms of disease recur-\n\nrence and OS in patients with phyllodes tumors of the breast  Xu et al [35] indicated that\nincreased Twist expression was related to worse distant metastasis-free survival  DMFS  in\n\npatients with breast cancer  These findings indicate that future research should focus on testing\n\nthe efficiency and safety of these inhibitors  In this context  a study by Ranganathan et al [36]\nindicated that quercetin downregulated Twist expression through inhibiting the p38MAPK\n\npathway  resulting in breast cancer cell apoptosis  The INK4a/ARF locus was central to apopto-\n\nsis through p53 pathway to inhibit proliferation[37  38]  The earlier reports found a novel\n\nfunction of Twist through interfering p14ARF-mediated p53 pathway  leading to developed\n\nanti-apoptotic activity[39  40]  Moreover  Inoue et al [41] suggested that Dmp1 was a regulator\nof the ARF-p53 pathway  Another study by Kwilas et al [42] demonstrated that a poxviral-\nbased cancer vaccine targeting Twist suppressed breast cancer cell growth and metastasis and\n\nimproved survival outcome in prostate carcinoma  Thus  these studies provided the initial evi-\n\ndence that there is potential benefit in targeting Twist in a therapeutic regimen for treating\n\ncancers  However  randomized controlled clinical trials are required to verify if a Twist inhibi-\n\ntor can really serve as a valid therapeutic strategy for cancer  Earlier literature has also reported\n\nan association between Twist over-expression and drug resistance against chemotherapeutic\n\ndrugs  including Taxol in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line[43]  and cisplatin and doxoru-\n\nbicin in bladder cancer cells[44]  These observations indicate that inhibiting Twist expression\n\ncould overcome chemoresistance in human tumors \n\nFurthermore  we also comprehensively investigated the association between elevated Twist\n\nexpression and clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer  We observed that elevated\n\nTwist expression significantly correlated with larger tumor size  lymph node involvement \n\nhigher nuclear grade  and positive HER2 status  In contrast  we did not observe a significant\n\nrelationship of Twist expression with age  ER status  and PR status  Previous studies have dem-\n\nonstrated that larger tumor size  lymph node metastasis  higher nuclear grade  and positive\n\nHER2 status are typically poor prognostic indicators of breast cancer[45–48]  Since these clini-\n\ncopathological parameters showed association with higher Twist expression in our study  we\n\nconclude that our meta-analysis further validates that Twist expression is indeed associated\n\nwith adverse prognosis in breast cancer  Another independent study by Vesuna et al [49]\nreported that Twist over-expression was associated with negative ER breast cancer subtype \n\nwhich is an aggressive prognostic subtype  Besides  Twist expression was notablely higher in\n\nTNBC  87 3%  55/63  followed by the positive HER2 status  71 8%  51/71  Luminal B  52 1% \n\nPrognostic value of Twist expression in breast cancer  A meta-analysis\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0186191 October 9  2017 9 / 13\n\n\n\n\n25/48  and Luminal A types  39 4%  89/226  in terms of molecular subtypes in breast cancer\n\n[29] Therefore  collective observations have demonstrated that Twist over-expression could be\n\nan appropriate biomarker in breast cancer prognosis \n\nWe should note that our study also had some limitations  First  some HRs were not offered\n\nin the original articles  and therefore HRs were extracted from the Kaplan-Meier curves for\n\nthese studies  This could have impacted the robustness of outcomes  Second  each study varied\n\nwith regards to Twist detection methods  as well as different variants and cut-off levels  These\n\ndifferences could potentially contribute to strong heterogeneity  Meta-regression analysis was\n\nperformed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity  but no significant confounding\n\nfactors were observed  Finally  the sample size was also relatively small in the included studies \n\nwhich could have influenced the pooled results \n\nIn conclusion  there was evidence of a just statistically significant difference between high\n\nTwist expression and worse OS in breast cancer  however  it may be debated whether it is really\n\nclinically relevant  additional well-designed cohort studies are needed to confirm the associa-\n\ntion  Also  our study found a significant association of Twist expression with breast cancer\n\nclinicopathological characteristics  including larger tumor size  lymph node metastasis  higher\n\nnuclear grade  and positive HER2 status \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig  Sensitivity analysis of Twist expression for

1%  p = 0 004  and lower histological\ngrades  20 9% G3 for the R0 vs 29 8%  when compared to patients with any risk criteria \n\nConclusions\nAlmost three out of ten BC patients have at least one hereditary risk cancer feature that\nwould warrant further genetic counseling  Patients with hereditary cancer risk seems to be\ndiagnosed with worse prognosis factors \n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women [1]  In Spain  it is estimated an age-\n\nstandardized  European standard population  incidence of 85 cases per 100 000 women [2] \n\nthat would be translated in 25 200 new cases per year  Breast cancer deaths are estimated to be\n\n18% of cancer mortality [3]  Known risk factors are age  late and non-parity  post-menopausal\n\nstatus  and familial background  Preventive and early diagnostic strategies are necessary to\n\nreduce the disease burden  However  these strategies vary among countries and even within\n\nregions of the same country [4]  while there is an increasing interest in adapting screening\n\nstrategies to the basal breast cancer risk [5]  In this sense  identifying high-risk groups in terms\n\nof frequency and prognosis is mandatory for a rationale preventive approach \n\nIt is widely described in the literature that up to 25% of breast cancer patients have a famil-\n\nial/hereditary background  that can be explained through a genetic condition only in a small\n\npercentage [6]  Population studies that support this data are scarce  and whether these patients\n\nhave different prognostic factors or not is a term of debate  Identification of patients at risk of\n\nhereditary breast cancer is especially important for those cases that harbor pathological genetic\n\ngermline mutations in BRCA1 or 2 \n\nRecently  the Spanish Medical Oncology Society  SEOM  have suggested clinical criteria for\n\ngenetic test selection of hereditary breast cancer patients through a clinical guideline [7]  In\n\nthe European context  the European Society for Medical Oncology  ESMO  has its own guide-\n\nlines [6]  In the North American context  the criteria seem to be less restrictive [8] \n\nThe implications of genetic testing are nowadays going beyond the prevention and early\n\ndetection area  influencing also therapeutic decisions with the use of specific treatments  such\n\nas oral PARP inhibitors or platinum-based regimens  Currently  several clinical trials are ongo-\n\ning for different clinical scenarios with these treatments  from the metastatic disease to the\n\nadjuvant setting  being in the spotlight of the oncology breast cancer community [9] \n\nIn summary  a better understanding of the epidemiological landscape of breast cancer\n\npatients with hereditary risk features is of interest \n\nEl Álamo

\n\nQuestionnaires including data regarding individual tumor information and familial fea-\n\ntures were completed by the clinical investigators  it can be found in reference [12]  Based on\n\nthese data  hereditary risk groups were defined  according to the following modified SEOM\n\nand ESMO criteria [6  7] \n\nModified ESMO-SEOM Criteria for hereditary breast cancer risk\nThe individual criteria were  breast cancer diagnosis under 40 years or breast cancer diagnosis\n\nunder 50 years if one of the following  triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  histology and/or\n\nbilateral  synchronous or metachronous  breast cancer or breast cancer at any age together\n\nwith ovarian cancer  The familial criteria were  the presence of first or second degree relatives\n\nwith the

three out of ten patients have  at least  one hereditary breast cancer risk feature \n\nand  in consequence  could be candidate for genetic testing and counselling  Overall  patients\n\nwith hereditary cancer risk features have larger tumors and more frequently nodal involve-\n\nment in comparison to patients without hereditary cancer risk features  while both subgroups\n\nhave a similar rate of distant metastases at initial diagnosis  However  these differences proba-\n\nbly are related to the greater aggressiveness observed in patients fulfilling the individual crite-\n\nria  Interestingly  when patients with TNBC were excluded for this analysis  presence of nodal\n\ninvolvement and higher grades  although not tumor size  remained higher in patients with\n\nhereditary risk features \n\nStrong points of this study are the large number of patients analyzed and the representative-\n\nness’ of Spanish population  since two thirds of the regions are represented  Few studies exist\n\nin Spain analyzing the frequency of different familial cancer from a population point of view \n\nwith the exception of melanoma [13]  pancreatic [14] and colorectal cancer [15]  However \n\nseveral limitations must be also taken into account when interpreting our results  First  the ret-\n\nrospective nature of our work that could concur in some bias  since almost 30% of patients\n\nanalyzed lack information to be included in a given risk group  Based on that  we decided to\n\nanalyze only those that could be categorized in a risk group  This could be a selection bias

percentage  However  due to the large number of patients analyzed \n\nthis possibility might be ameliorated \n\nAnother weakness  in order to classify patients in a given risk group  is the fact that nearly\n\n60% of patients had an unknown HER2 status  in consequence  a substantial number of\n\npatients  could not be evaluated regarding the TN phenotype  one of the major risk factors for\n\nhereditary breast cancer  Within the time-frame of data collection  patients diagnosed from\n\n1998 to 2001  although the role of HER2 was well known as a prognostic factor  the determi-\n\nnation of this biomarker was not widely used  given that appropriate targeted therapy was only\n\navailable for metastatic patients \n\nPatients with hereditary cancer risk features have worse pathological risk factors  according\n\nto T and N status  and to histological grade  all well-known bad prognosis factors  Data of\n\nprognosis from patients with known BRCA 1 and 2 mutations are conflicting in literature  A\n\nrecent meta-analysis did not detect differences in breast cancer specific survival rate in BRCA2\n\nmutation carriers when compared to sporadic ones [16]  I contrast  another meta-analysis con-\n\nfers a poorer prognosis for patients with BRCA1 mutations [17]  Another recent meta-analysis\n\nconfer worse overall survival to BRCA1 mutation carriers and worse breast cancer specific sur-\n\nvival [18]  In our study  we did not analyze survival  and we did not have data regarding\n\nBRCA1 and 2 status  so in consequence we cannot put our data into the context of theses\n\nmeta-analysis \n\nOne could think that patients concerned with their familial background are more prone to\n\nintensive surveillance  both by themselves and by their health care givers  what should be trans-\n\nlated into earlier diagnostic presentations  something that is not reflected by our data  This is\n\ntrue in other familial cancers  such as melanoma  where patients at familial risk in Spain pres-\n\nent with better prognosis pathological factors [13]  However  since the subgroup responsible\n\nfor these differences is the individual risk group  which is enriched with the triple negative\n\nphenotype  the known biological aggressiveness of this subtype may account for these differ-\n\nences in TNM presentation \n\nIt is important to analyze if our data are comparable to other countries  Our results are\n\naccording to what is described in general literature [6]  However  studies conducted in other\n\ncountries searching for similar endpoints as our present work  revealed mixed results  In a\n\nBritish study with more than 5 000 BC patients  a positive family history of BC  with no more\n\nspecific details  was found in 22 2%  in contrast to 16 8%  14 5% FR and 2 3% IFR groups \n\nfound in our work [19]  In this study  a younger age of presentation was found among patients\n\nwith family history  In a pooled analysis with more than 47 000 BC patients  in which 92%\n\nwere of European ancestry  revealed that 11% of patients were<40y  20% had a positive first\n\ndegree family history and that 14% were TNBC  18% of patients with TNBC had also a positive\n\nfamily history of cancer [20]  In African-American women  a study found that 16% of BC\n\npatients had first degree family history  3% ovarian cancer and 15% were TNBC [21]  Finally \n\nin Chinese population  a lower proportion of BC with family history  5 1%  was described in a\n\nstudy focused in Han Chinese population  the majority of Chinese population ethnicity [22] \n\nThese results reveal that family history and other risk factors associated with increased heredi-\n\ntary risk could be dependent of geographical origin  although the limitations of the heteroge-\n\nneity of the different studies should be taken into account \n\nFinally  the practical consequences of our findings should be taken into consideration  In\n\ngeneral  it is estimated that  according to different institutional series in Spain and western\n\ncountries  BRCA 1 or 2 mutations are present from 7% to 20% of selected and unselected\n\npatients in western countries [23–27]  With this in mind  and since genetic testing will be eas-\n\nier and cheaper in the near future  our findings suggests that it is urgently needed an increase\n\nFamilial breast cancer in Spain\n\nPLOS

\n\nCatheter Thrombosis in Breast CancerP  Debourdeau et al \n\nIntroduction\n\nBreast cancer  BC  accounting for 25% of women cancers  \nis the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of \ndeath in the female population worldwide [1]  As com-\npared to their age- matched individual counterparts without \ncancer  BC women have a three to fourfold increased \nrisk of venous thromboembolism  VTE  [2  3]  which \nwas notably demonstrated to be an independent prognostic \nfactor for survival and the second cause of death in all \ncancer patients [4–7]  A large UK registry study [6  8] \nrecently showed that the VTE risk in BC patients is spe-\ncifically higher around the diagnosis period and until \n3 months later  particularly on  neo adjuvant chemotherapy \n NAC  [6]  meanwhile long- term central venous catheters \n CVC  are commonly inserted to facilitate intravenous \nadministration of treatments  While risk factors for VTE \nin BC women have been extensively investigated [6]  data \nregarding CVC- related thrombosis  CRT  are scarce and \nfactors promoting CRT in this specific population remain \npoorly understood  Previous epidemiologic cohort studies \nwere conducted only in heterogeneous cancer patient \npopulations  Verso et al  first reported an overall incidence \nof 4–5%  0% to 28%  for symptomatic CRT and 30% \n 27% to 66%  for asymptomatic CRT detected by venog-\nraphy in unselected cancer patients [9]  The incidence of \nCRT further varies widely between studies  due to many \ndifferences in CRT definition and diagnostic procedures  \nImportantly  symptomatic CRT have been found to result \nin pulmonary embolism  PE  in 10–15% of unselected \ncancer patients [9  10]  On the other side  the clinical \nconsequences of an asymptomatic CRT diagnosed on vari-\nous imaging tools still remain uncertain  particularly con-\ncerning its spontaneous outcome without anticoagulation \ntreatment and if its early diagnosis may predict the onset \nof symptomatic CRT [11]  In the absence of evidence  \nanticoagulants are not currently recommended for CRT \nprophylaxis [12]  and the ASCO guidelines on CVC care \nfor cancer patients highlighted the need for additional \nresearch in this area [13]  We  therefore  designed the \nprospective multicenter CAVECCAS  Cathéter VEineux \nCentral et CAncer du Sein  study in a highly selected \npopulation of nonmetastatic invasive BC patients to inves-\ntigate the specific incidence  risk factors and outcomes of \nboth asymptomatic and symptomatic CRT in BC patients \nwithin the 6 months after CVC insertion for NAC \n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy design\n\nThis multicenter observational cohort study was conducted \nin nine cancer hospitals between September 2008 and \n\nDecember 2011  All nonmetastatic invasive BC patients \nwere screened  The inclusion criteria were histologically \nproven BC cancer patients older than 18 years to be \ntreated by adjuvant chemotherapy or NAC necessitating \nthe insertion of a port single central lumen catheter for \nmore than 3 months [14]  All CVC were inserted via the \ninternal jugular  axillary or subclavian veins and terminated \nin the superior vena cava  We excluded patients receiving \nNAC via peripherally inserted catheter  tunneled catheters \nwithout port and femoral CVC  patients treated by a \nprevious chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy  patients \non curative anticoagulant therapy  patients with a platelet \ncount  175 μmol/L  All eligible consecu-\ntive patients were prospectively enrolled after obtaining \ntheir written informed consent to participate in the trial  \nThe study was approved by Ethical Committee of Paris \n France  and registered on clinical trial gov  ClinicalTrials \ngov Identifier  NCT00714909 \n\nData collection\n\nBaseline patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics  \ncancer characteristics  site  jugular or subclavian  and side \n right or left  of CVC insertion were recorded as well as \nthe insertion procedure duration and the number of veni-\npunctures  >2  According to Good Clinical Practices \nGuidelines [15]  Doppler- ultrasonography  DUS  was rec-\nommended to guide CVC insertion  which had to be \npreferably positioned on the right side [10  14  16]  with \nCVC distal tip at the superior vena cava and the right \natrium junction  In women with right BC  CVC insertion \nwas allowed on the left side \n\nOutcome measures\n\nAll patients underwent double- blind DUS before and 7  \n30  and 90 days  D  after CVC insertion  including com-\npression  B- mode imaging with the addition of color and \npulsed- wave Doppler  The following parameters were \nrecorded on both sides on the humeral  axillary

computed tomography  or pulmonary scin-\ntigraphy  CRT was defined as the occurrence of a mural \nthrombus extending from CVC into the lumen [15]  For \nveins accessible to direct insonation  diagnostic criteria of \nCRT were  noncompressibility  visualization of echogenic \nintravascular mass and absence of respiratory variation \n jugular  axillary or subclavian veins  [17]  For veins

All DUS thrombotic events were reviewed \nby two physicians  DF  PD  unaware of clinical data  \nWhen an asymptomatic CRT was diagnosed on DUS as \nscheduled by systematic examination according to the \nstudy protocol  patient and referring physicians were blind \nto DUS results  CVC dysfunction not related to CRT  \nsuch as distal thrombus without mural involvement or a \nfibrin sleeve around the CVC distal tip  or pinch- off syn-\ndrome were not recorded as an event  According to the \nstudy protocol  asymptomatic CRT were not to be treated  \nand thrombus evolution was assessed upon next DUS

of a similar age without \ncancer [2  3  6  22]  and important insights into time- \ndependent- related VTE risk factors during BC treatment \nwere recently gained [6]  However  previous studies \ninvestigating VTE in BC patients focused on the risk of \ndeep vein thrombosis  DVT  and PE  They did not \naddress the risk of CRT  while the highest VTE absolute \nrate in BC population was observed during the course \nof chemotherapy  usually administered via CVC  and \nwithin the month after cessation of chemotherapy  with  \nrespectively  10 8 and 8 4 cases/1000 [6  8]  The use of \nCVC to deliver NAC in BC has considerably increased \nin the past decades and CRT has become a major prob-\nlem in contemporary oncology practice  Indeed  CRT \naccounts for significant morbidity with prolonged hos-\npitalization [23]  direct increase in treatment- related and \nmanagement costs when CVC replacement is warranted \n[24]  Therefore  it remains important to identify BC \npatients at higher risk for CRT \n\nThe CAVECCAS study was specifically designed in a \nselected population of nonmetastatic BC patients undergo-\ning insertion of a single lumen CVC for at least 3 months \nto analyze the incidence and outcomes of both asymp-\ntomatic and symptomatic CRT after CVC insertion on \nrepeated DUS  and until 6 months of clinical follow- up  \nIt also aimed to a comprehensive analysis of the various \nclinical and biological CRT risk factors that may help \nclinicians to further identify BC patients who may be \ncandidate for thromboprophylaxis \n\nFigure 2  Incidence of

significant predictor of VTE in a large \nBC population  HR  3 0  95%CI  2 1–4 4  [6]  CAVECCAS \nresults point out the role of obesity as a major contribu-\ntor to CRT in BC patients  It first highlights the role of \ninvasive lobular carcinoma  ILC  histological type  which \nhas been reported to be less responsive to NAC than \nductal carcinoma  probably due to differences in molecular \ncharacteristics  particularly HR and HER2 expression [30]  \nA relationship between ILC and serum estrogen levels \nhas been previously suggested given the increasing fre-\nquency of ILC among postmenopausal women taking \nhormone replacement therapy [31  32]  Interestingly  \nestrogens have different effects on the coagulation system \nresulting in a procoagulant state [33] \n\nWe also investigated if reliable biomarkers of blood \ncoagulation activation and fibrinolysis help to identify \nthose BC patients at higher risk of CRT and to tailor \nthe need for CRT thromboprophylaxis  Two previous \nstudies supported that D- dimers levels correlate with \nsymptomatic CRT  In a case control study by Jansen et al  \n\n[34]  30 CRT patients with a Hickman catheter undergo-\ning allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for hemato-\nlogical malignancies were compared with 30 matched \ncontrols  Patients with D- dimers levels >350 μg/L measured \nthree to 5 days after catheter insertion had a 6 times \nhigher risk of developing subclavian CRT [34]  Similar \nresults were found in 48 patients with renal insufficiency  \nalbeit inserted with double lumen catheters for hemodi-\nalysis [35]  In CAVECCAS study  the significant increase \nin D- dimers levels after catheter insertion  P < 0 0001  \nreflecting blood coagulation activation  did not predict \nCRT occurrence  Measures of the thrombin generation \npotential provide a global method to quantify the effect \nof the numerous genetic and environmental factors involved \nin the coagulation pathway  In the Vienna Cancer and \nThrombosis Study  CATS  elevated thrombin peak values \nwere associated with an increased risk of DVT or PE \nwith a hazard ratio of 2 1  95% CI 1 3–3 3  in multivari-\nate analysis [21]  On the contrary  in our study  neither \nthe thrombin generation peak height nor the endogenous \nthrombin potential predicted CRT \n\nMPs have emerged as promising biomarkers due to \ntheir procoagulant properties related to the exposure of \nnegatively charged phospholipids  mainly phosphatidyl- \nserine and tissue factor  Several studies showed that \nincreased levels of Tissue Factor positive MPs correlated \nwith VTE or PE in cancer patients [36]  but there are \nno data yet on the role of MPs in the occurrence of \nCRT in cancer patients  We therefore investigated whether \nPd- MPs were predictive of CRT in the CAVECCAS cohort  \nParadoxically  we observed that both Pd- MPs and Pd- \nMPs/PS+ levels significantly decreased after CVC insertion  \nHigh levels of Pd- MPS and Pd- MPS/PS+ did not correlate \nwith CRT  Our results do not support routine testing of \nthese biomarkers in BC patients with CVC  but further \nstudies are required to confirm these findings in patients \nwith other malignancies \n\nHeritable or acquired risk factors for VTE of clinical \nrelevance include antithrombin  protein S  protein C defi-\nciencies  the G1691A polymorphism FVL  the prothrombin \nG20210A polymorphism  presence of lupus anticoagulant  \npositivity of anticardiolipin and antiβ2GP1 antibodies  We \nperformed a nested case- control study for all these throm-\nbophilia risk factors and found no difference between \ncases and matched controls for any of these  Our results \nappeared controversial with previous studies  which \nreported significant associations between FV Leiden poly-\nmorphism and CRT in acute leukemia [37]  bone marrow \ntransplant [38]  unselected cancer patients [39] and in \nlocally advanced or metastatic BC patients  all treated with \nthe same chemotherapy protocol [40] \n\nA limitation of our study is that it was underpowered \nto demonstrate the association of heritable or acquired \n\n\n\n2742 © 2017 The Authors

was not possible to measure \nantithrombin  protein C  protein S  lupus anticoagulant  \nanticardiolipin and antiβ2GP1 antibodies  and to test FVL \nand G20210A prothrombin polymorphisms in the whole \nincluded population  Blood samples were drawn in patients \nwith CRT and matched- controls only and we used of a \nnested case control study approach \n\nThe main strength of our study using repeated DUS is \nto provide current estimates of absolute risk of both \nasymptomatic and symptomatic CRT and their outcomes \nin a large sample size of 534 selected BC patients  as well \nas a comprehensive analysis of the multiplicity of CRT \nrisk factors  According to current identified CRT risk fac-\ntors [10  14  16]  we chose to study a highly selected \npopulation of nonmetastatic invasive BC patients neces-\nsitating NAC via a central lumen catheter  Indeed  we \naimed to investigate the specific incidence  risk factors \nand outcomes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic \nCRT in nonmetastatic BC patients within the 6 months \nafter CVC insertion for NAC  since no study has yet ana-\nlyzed this frequent clinical setting  Further studies will be \nnecessary in BC patients with metastatic disease to analyze \nif the risk of CRT is higher  as already shown in metastatic \ncancer patients with VTE outside the context of CRT \n\nIn summary  the CAVECCAS study provides unique \nclinical data on a large number of highly selected patients \nover a relatively long period of follow- up  BC patients \ntreated with NAC are at increased risk of CRT  and obesity \nand lobular carcinoma histological type appear as major \nCRT- risk factors  Clinical parameters only allowed to \nidentify high risk DUS- CRT patients  Whether assessment \nof these risk factors may be clinically useful for an indi-\nvidual stratification of BC patients who might benefit from \nCRT prophylaxis deserves further studies \n\nExisting guidelines recommend not to use anticoagula-\ntion for routine prophylaxis of CRT [14  41]  Nevertheless  \ntwo studies [42  43] and one meta- analysis [44] suggested \na potential benefit in CRT prevention using anticoagulants  \nIn this setting  the potential benefits of new anti- thrombotic \ndrugs should be further evaluated \n\nAcknowledgements\n\nOther GFTC members significantly contributed to patients \ninclusion and data collection as

Accurately esti-\nmating the prognosis of each patient may not only benefit \nclinical decision- making but also inform the individualized \ndesign of surgical follow- up surveillance plans  For early- \nstage breast cancer  several risk prediction models  RPM  \n\nhave been developed and widely validated [1]  including \nNPI [2]  Adjuvant  [3]  Oncotype Dx [4]  and Mammaprint \n[5]  etc  However  no RPM has been widely accepted for \nStage IV breast cancer patients  The TBCRC 013 study \n[6] suggested that the 21- Gene recurrence score has prog-\nnostic value in stage IV breast cancer patients  However  \nthere were more clinicopathological features reported to \nbe significantly associated with survival in these patients  \n\nORIGINAL RESEARCH\n\nDevelopment and validation of a

patients  We searched the National Cancer Database \n NCDB  for stage IV breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2013  \nPredictors of OS were identified and a nomogram was developed and validated \nusing concordance index  C- index  calibration plots  and risk group stratifica-\ntions  A total of 7199 patients from the NCDB were included in the study  \nWith a median follow- up of 25 7 months  the 1- year and 3- year OS rates were \n80 6% and 52 5%  respectively  Race  age  comorbidity status  T- stage  grade  \nER/PR/Her2 status  the presence of lung/liver/brain metastasis  surgery  radio-\ntherapy  and chemotherapy were significantly associated with OS  The developed \nnomogram had a C- index of 0 722  95% CI 0 710–0 734  and 0 725  95% CI \n0 713–0 736  in the training and the validation cohorts  respectively  The pre-\ndicted survival using the nomogram is well correlated with actual OS  The \nnomogram was able to stratify patients into different risk groups  among which \nthe survival benefit of local therapy varied  We developed a nomogram to predict \nthe overall survival of stage IV breast cancer patients  Prospectively designed \nstudies with international

models with all clinicopathologi-\ncal features for survival prediction of stage IV breast cancer \npatients  The National Cancer Database  NCDB  is hospital \nbased  and the participating centers are required to submit \ndata to the database  and the data covers approximately \n70% of cancer patients in United States  In this study  \nwe used the NCDB to investigate the prognostic factors \nof survival in stage IV breast cancer patients and devel-\noped a nomogram using these prognostic factors for sur-\nvival predictions  The aim of this study was to develop \na prognostic model that could be used for individualized \nrisk assessment of stage IV breast cancer patients \n\nMethod\n\nWe searched the NCDB database for eligible patients  Data \nincluding the site of metastasis  bone  brain  liver and \nlung  and ER/PR/HER2 status are only available after \n2010  In this study  we only included patients with critical \ndata available  The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria \nare listed as follows \n\nInclusion\n\n 1  Female breast cancer \n 2  Diagnosed between 2010 and 2013 \n 3  American Joint Committee on Cancer  AJCC  stage IV \n 4  Confirmed pathology \n 5  No prior

comorbid conditions  \nHigher score indicates more comorbid conditions   http //\nncdbpuf facs org/  Patients were categorized into two age \ngroups based on their age at diagnosis  ≤60 years  \n>60 years  as the median age of the study population \nwas close to 60  Radiation therapy  RT  was divided into \ntwo categories  with RT and without RT \n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe assigned the eligible patients into the training and valida-\ntion study cohort  respectively  Detailed in Data S1  We \nconducted a descriptive analysis of the baseline clinicopatho-\nlogical features of the included patients and used the Chi- \nsquare test to compare the characteristics of patients between \nthe training and validation cohort  The median follow- up \nwas calculated as the median observed survival time of the \nentire population  Overall survival  OS  was measured as the \ntime from diagnosis to death due to any causes  The cumula-\ntive OS rates were estimated using Kaplan–Meier analysis \n\nWe used the unadjusted Cox regression model as a \nunivariate analysis to screen for prognostic factors of overall \nsurvival  Factors determined to be significant by the \ncompeting- risk analysis were incorporated into the Cox \nproportional hazard regression as a multivariate analysis \n\nWe used the Cox regression model and the “rms” pack-\nage in R to develop an OS prediction nomogram with \n1- year and 3- year OS as the endpoints  To evaluate the \ndiscriminative ability of the nomogram  we used the Harrell’s \nconcordance index  C- index  [11] with a 95% CI  To assess \nthe accuracy of the nomogram  we used calibration plots \nto visualize the agreement between the predicted and actual \n1- year and 3- year OS  All P-values were two- sided  P-values \nless than 0 05 were considered statistically significant  The \nstatistical analysis was performed using Stata/MP  version \n13 0  StataCorp LP  College Station  TX  USA  and R \n\nResults\n\nBaseline clinicopathological features\n\nA total of 7199 patients were included from the NCDB \ndatabase  The number of patients being excluded at each \nstep during the patient selection was summarized in Figure 1 \n\nThe clinicopathological features of the patients are sum-\nmarized in Table 1  The median age  25th–75th percentile  \nwas 58  49–67  years old  There were 62 7%  24 8%  6 0%  \nand 26 1% of the patients having bone  liver  brain  and \nlung metastasis  respectively  The median follow- up was \n25 7 months  The 1- year and 3- year OS rates were 80 6% \nand 52 5%  respectively  There were no significant differ-\nences between the training and validation cohort \n\n\n\n\n\n2588 © 2017 The Authors  Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd  \n\nS  Li et al Predicting Survival of Stage IV Breast Cancer\n\nScreen for prognostic factors for OS\n\nPrognostic factors including year of diagnosis  tumor loca-\ntion  Quadrants  and tumor laterality are theoretically \nnot associated with survival  and were excluded from this \nanalysis  We used unadjusted Cox regression and observed \nthat race  White vs  African American  age  ≤60 years \nvs  >60 years  Charlson score  1 or 2 vs  0  T- stage  \ntumor grade III vs  I  ER/PR/Her2 status  lung metastasis \n Yes vs  No  liver metastasis  Yes vs  No  brain metastasis \n Yes vs  No  breast surgery BCS/Mastectomy vs  No  \nradiation therapy  Yes vs  No  and chemotherapy \n Multiagent vs  None  were significantly associated with \nOS  The presence of bone metastasis  N- stage  N2 vs  \nN0  and histology  IDC  ILC  Others  were not associ-\nated with OS  Table S1  We noticed that some subgroup \nof patients had similar OS  and therefore we combined \nthem as one category in the multivariate analysis  includ-\ning T0- 1 and T2  T4 and Tx  Grade I and II  no chemo-\ntherapy and single- agent chemotherapy  BCS and \nmastectomy  In the multivariate analysis  all of these factors \nwere significantly correlated with OS  Table 2 \n\nNomogram development and validation\n\nA nomogram was developed using the training cohort \n Fig  2  Each prognostic factor used to create the nomo-\ngram was given a score  By adding up these scores  we \ncan calculate a total score  Then we can draw a straight \n\nline down from the total point scale to estimate the 1- year \nand 3- year OS  The C- index of the nomogram were 0 722 \n 95% CI 0 710–0 734  and 0 725  95% CI 0 713–0 736  \nin the training and validation cohort  respectively  The \nC- index of the nomogram is higher than ER status  PR \nstatus  HER2 status  and the presence of liver/lung/brain \nmetastases  Table S2  The calibration plots suggested that \nthe accuracy of the predicted 1- year and 3- year OS using \nthe nomogram is excellent in both the training and vali-\ndation cohorts  Fig  3 \n\nRisk stratifications using the new \nnomogram\n\nThe distribution of the predicted 1- year and 3- year OS \nwas shown in Figure S1  We assigned the patients into \ndifferent subgroups based on the quartile of the predicted \n3- year OS  Using our model to stratify patients with only \nbone metastases and ER+/HER2-  diseases into four dif-\nferent groups allowed for significant distinctions between \nthe KM curves  Figure S2  The first  second  third  and \nfourth quartile subgroups had 98 2%  93 5%  80 1%  and \n68 0% 1- year OS  and 82 2%  63 3%  49 6%  and 25 4% \n3- year OS  respectively  Similarly  in patients with visceral \nmetastases  lung  liver  or brain  and ER-/PR- disease \n N = 5 patients in the first quartile group and were \nexcluded  three subgroups of patients also had significant \ndistinctions among the KM curves  Figure S2  The second  \nthird  and fourth quartile subgroups had 98 1%  84 0%  \nand 52 1% 1- year OS  and 71 1%  44 6%  and 19 0% \n3- year OS  respectively \n\nExploratory analysis  estimation of the \nsurvival benefit of local surgery in stage IV \nbreast cancer patients\n\nWith the nomogram  we can estimate the survival benefit \nof surgery for each patient  by calculating the difference \nof the predicted OS when the patient was considered as \nreceived and did not receive surgery  The median  25–75th \npercentile  benefit of surgery of 1- yr and 3- yr OS was \n0 8%  0 3–1 6%  and 1 6%  0 7–3 0%  respectively \n\nDiscussion\n\nThere is an increasing interest in stage IV breast cancer \npatients  as the proportion of these patients seems to be \nhigher in recent years  when compared with the past  \nSystemic use of advanced imaging methods  such as PET- CT \nscanning  should be the underlying reasons  and this phe-\nnomenon was called as stage migration  that is some \npatients who previously would have been classified as \nearly- stage  would be reclassified to late- stage  due to the \n\nFigure 1  We applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to NCDB \ndatabase and enrolled 7199 patients as the study population \n\n\n\n2589© 2017 The Authors  Cancer

highly dependent on the \npredicted survival  However  different metastatic patterns \nat initial diagnosis  bone  brain  liver lung  etc  combined \nwith different molecular disease subtypes  HR+/HER2-   \nHR+/HER2+  ER- /HER2+  ER- /HER2-   may lead to varied \noverall survival in these patients [7–9]  Accurately predict-\ning the survival of these patients is of paramount impor-\ntance  Many RPMs are widely used in early- stage breast \ncancer [1]  however  there are only a few RPMs that have \nbeen reported in advanced/metastatic breast cancer  Lee \net al  [12] developed a nomogram to predict the survival \ntime in women with advanced breast cancer using data \nfrom clinical trials conducted by the Australia & New \nZealand Breast Cancer Trials Group  Prognostic factors \nused to create that nomogram included ECOG status  ER \n\nstatus  neutrophil levels  age  number of metastatic sites  \nhemoglobin levels  and alkaline phosphatase levels  Lee \net al  [13] used multicenter data from hospitals in South \nKorea and developed a PMOS system that utilized stage  \nHR status  Ki67 index  distant metastasis- free interval  \nsymptoms  and number of metastatic sites

more favorable outcomes [14]  In this \nstudy  we used the NCDB database to retrieve data from \nall stage IV breast cancer patients  developed a nomogram \npredicting the 1- year and 3- year OS rates

\nguidelines [15]  hormone receptor- positive advanced breast \ncancer patients without visceral crisis should receive endo-\ncrine therapy as a first- line therapy  However  our study \nshowed that from these patients the new nomogram was \nable to identify a high- risk subgroup who might need more \nintensive therapy  e g  chemotherapy  first  In patients with \n\nonly bone metastasis and ER+/HER2-  diseases  the 3- year \nOS rates were 82 2% and 25 4% in the first and fourth \nquartile subgroups  respectively  Therefore  this new model \ncan identify high- risk patients who were considered to have \na favorable prognosis based on the current standards  \nSimilarly  in patients with visceral metastases and ER- /PR-  \ndiseases  the new nomogram can also identify low- risk \npatients  with 1- year and 3- year OS of 98 1% and 71 1%  \nrespectively  Prognosis stratifications using our new model \nwould be informative and helpful for clinical decision- \nmaking  It could

 \n\nPredicting Survival of Stage IV Breast CancerS  Li et al \n\nour study  we cannot distinguish the de novo stage IV \nbreast cancer patients from those who progressed to stage \nIV after adjuvant therapies  This is a major limitation  \nSeveral studies have showed that these two subsets of \npatients had different survival  and for the latter ones  \nmore variables  disease free interval  adjuvant therapies  \netc  could be incorporated in our nomogram to enhance \nthe performance  More studies are needed  Third  we \nrandomly separate the population into two cohorts  train-\ning and validation cohort  We still need another popula-\ntion from different country to externally validate this \nnomogram  In addition  we need to be aware that the \nuse of our nomogram in populations from randomized \nclinical trials will be the gold standard of its validation  \nand observational data are likely to provide misleading \nestimates of treatment effects [19] \n\nSummary\n\nIn this study  we developed a novel nomogram predicting \nthe 1- year and 3- year OS of stage IV breast cancer patients \nusing national cancer database  The new nomogram can \nstratify patients into

probe the ECM and to ascer-\ntain the appropriate cellular response  Cellular protrusions are \nbroadly classified in function of membrane shape and/or size \nand primarily include lamellipodia  membrane blebs  filopo-\ndia  and filopodia-like protrusions  Chhabra and Higgs  2007  \nPetrie and Yamada  2012  Filopodia are thin  finger-like pro-\njections exploited widely by different cell types  including neu-\nrons  endothelial cells  epithelial cells  fibroblasts  and immune \ncells  Mattila and Lappalainen  2008  Heckman and Plummer  \n2013  Jacquemet et al  2015  wherein they contribute to cellu-\nlar communication  Sagar et al  2015  directional cell migra-\ntion  Jacquemet et al  2015  and the establishment of cell–cell \njunctions  Biswas and Zaidel-Bar  2017  In vivo  filopodia \nhave been reported to contribute to processes such as endothe-\nlial sprouting and angiogenesis  Phng et al  2013  Wakayama et \nal  2015  ECM deposition and remodeling  Sato et al  2017  \nepithelial sheet migration during wound healing and dorsal clo-\nsure  Wood et al  2002  Millard and Martin  2008  and embry-\nonic development  Fierro-González et al  2013 \n\nFilopodia may also contribute to pathological conditions  \nincluding cancer and brain disorders  Jacquemet et al  2015  \nKanjhan et al  2016  We and others have reported that filopo-\ndia and filopodia-like protrusions are extensively used by cancer \ncells to support directional single-cell migration and invasion as \nwell as survival at distant metastatic sites  Shibue et al  2012  \n2013  Jacquemet et al  2013a  2016  Arjonen et al  2014  Paul \net al  2015  In addition  the expression of several filopodia reg-\nulatory proteins has been shown to correlate with poor patient \nsurvival in multiple cancer types  the down-regulation of which \nimpedes cancer metastasis in animal models  Yap et al  2009  \nArjonen et al  2014  Li et al  2014  Therefore  targeting filo-\npodia formation could prove a viable strategy to impair cancer \ncell metastasis  Jacquemet et al  2016  However  cancer cell \ndissemination is an intricate multistep process  Gupta and Mas-\nsagué  2006  and the significance of filopodia at every stage of \nthe metastatic cascade is not clear \n\nIn spite of their wide biological importance  filopodia re-\nmain poorly studied  primarily because of technical difficulties  \nIn particular  filopodia are difficult to observe  especially in \nvivo  owing to their small size  the absence of specific mark-\ners  and an often labile nature  which is particularly affected by \nfixation protocols  Wood and Martin  2002  Sato et al  2017  \n\nDefective filopodia formation is linked to pathologies such as cancer  wherein actively protruding filopodia  at the inva-\nsive front  accompany cancer cell dissemination  Despite wide biological significance  delineating filopodia function in \ncomplex systems remains challenging and is particularly hindered by lack of compatible methods to quantify filopodia \nproperties  Here  we present FiloQuant  a freely available ImageJ plugin  to detect filopodia-like protrusions in both \nfixed- and live-cell microscopy data  We demonstrate that FiloQuant can extract quantifiable information  including \nprotrusion dynamics  density  and length  from multiple cell types and in a range of microenvironments  In cellular mod-\nels of breast ductal carcinoma in situ  we reveal a link between filopodia formation at the cell–matrix interface  in col-\nlectively invading cells and 3D tumor spheroids  and the in vitro invasive capacity of the carcinoma  Finally  using \nintravital microscopy  we observe that tumor spheroids display filopodia in vivo  supporting a potential role for these \nprotrusions during tumorigenesis \n\nFiloQuant reveals increased filopodia density \nduring breast cancer progression\n\nGuillaume Jacquemet 1 Ilkka Paatero 1* Alexandre F  Carisey 2 3* Artur Padzik 1 Jordan S  Orange 2

addition  automatic quantification of filopodia properties re-\nmains a challenge  despite the availability of dedicated tools  \nand therefore  filopodia features are often described using \nmanual analyses  To our knowledge  currently available tools \nto quantify filopodia include FiloDetect  Nilufar et al  2013  \nCellGeo  Tsygankov et al  2014  and ADA PT  Barry et al  \n2015  each with unique strengths and shortcomings  Table 1  \nLimitations of these tools include requirement for proprietary \nsoftware  i e  MAT LAB and MAT LAB Image Processing \nToolbox  lack of customizable options to improve filopodia de-\ntection  selective dedication to live-cell data or to fixed samples \nonly  designation for single cells only  quantification of filopo-\ndia numbers  but not density  and the usage of an unmodifiable \nand/or complex code source that precludes addition of extra \nfunctionalities by nonexperts \n\nIn the process of addressing these limitations  we devel-\noped FiloQuant to detect filopodia and filopodia-like protru-\nsions  finger-like  and to extract quantifiable data on protrusion \ndynamics  density  and length from both fixed- and live-cell \nmicroscopy images  Here  we provide three versions of Filo-\nQuant  software 1  single image analysis  software 2  semiau-\ntomated  software 3  fully automated for large analyses and/\nor live-cell imaging  on the freely available ImageJ platform  \neach designed with a different purpose in mind and with alter-\nnative levels of user control over the analysis  Using FiloQuant  \nwe demonstrate that filopodia can be successfully detected in \ndifferent cells and in a range of microenvironments  including \nduring collective or single cancer cell migration in 2D and 3D  \nin fixed neuronal cultures  and in sprouting endothelial cells in \nvivo  regardless of the imaging modality  Using FiloQuant  we \nreport that in a cellular model of breast cancer progression filo-\npodia density and length  during collective invasion and in 3D \ntumor spheroids  appears to correlate with the previously de-\nscribed capacity of these breast cancer cells to invade locally in \nvivo  Miller et al  2000  Behbod et al  2009  Lodillinsky et al  \n\n2016  Finally  using intravital microscopy  we report that tumor \nspheroids in vivo display a high number of filopodia \n\nResults\n\nFiloQuant  an ImageJ tool to rapidly \nquantify filopodia length and density  \nunder different cellular contexts\nWe developed FiloQuant as a plugin for the ImageJ software \nwith inter operating systems compatibility  Schindelin et al  \n2012  In brief  FiloQuant works by first defining the cell/ \ncolony edge in an input image after intensity based threshold-\ning and removal of long thin protrusions such as filopodia from \nthe plasma membrane  Fig   1  A  In parallel  the same input \nimage is separately enhanced  Fig  1 B  to optimize filopodia \ndetection and is then superimposed on the filopodia-erased cell-\nedge image to specifically isolate filopodia at the cell boundary \n Fig  1 A  The number and length of these cell-edge filopodia \nare then automatically analyzed by FiloQuant using the skele-\ntonize and AnalyzeSkeleton algorithms  Arganda-Carreras et \nal  2010  Filopodia density can also be determined by calcu-\nlating the ratio of filopodia number to edge length  extracted by \nFiloQuant from the edge detection image  Fig  1 A \n\nTo make this software as easy to use as possible  FiloQuant \n single image analysis version  software 1  contains step-by-step \nuser validation of the various processing stages to help users \nachieve optimal settings for filopodia detection  This is especially \nimportant  as efficient detection of filopodia can vary from image \nto image  even when acquired under similar settings  mainly be-\ncause the small size of these structures results in weak signals  \nSeveral enhancements and filtering options are available in Filo-\nQuant to improve filopodia detection  and we provide here a de-\ntailed manual explaining how to use FiloQuant  see supplemental \nzip file  In particular  among the enhancement strategies tested  \n\nTable 1  Comparison of FiloQuant with previously described filopodia analysis software\n\nFiloDetect  Nilufar et al  2013  CellGeo  Tsygankov et al  2014  ADA PT

applicable to filopodia localized \nat cell–cell junctions or to filopodia that protrude dorsally on top \nof the cell body or ventrally underneath the cell  Fig  1 C \n\nTo assess the reliability of FiloQuant in scoring filopodia  \nresults obtained using this software were compared with man-\nual analyses of 59 images displaying a broad range of filopodia \ndensities  Fig  2 A  Importantly  FiloQuant readouts of filopo-\ndia number in this dataset correlated well with manual counting \n Fig   2  A  Moreover  filopodia length measurements obtained \nwith FiloQuant were  overall  very comparable to manual analyses \n\nFigure 1  FiloQuant  an ImageJ tool to rapidly quantify filopodia length and density   A  Workflow depicting FiloQuant analysis of filopodia density \nand length  Representative images obtained at the different stages of analysis are displayed  In brief  the original image  input  undergoes two parallel \nprocessing steps  In the top panel  the cell edge is defined and detected by intensity based thresholding and by ”erasing” the filopodia  edge detection  \nIn the bottom panel  the image is enhanced to optimize detection of faint filopodia without

2000  Behbod et al  2009  \nLodillinsky et al  2016  We demonstrate that the higher den-\nsity of long filopodia displayed by DCIS COM cells appears to \ncorrelate with enhanced ability to invade through Matrigel and \ncollagen  Fig  6 C  and with increased migration speed of single \ncells within the monolayer  Fig  6 D  As filopodia formation \n density and length  are particularly enhanced in DCIS COM \ncells compared with normal MCF10A breast epithelial cells \n Figs  5 and 6  and as filopodia are known to play a role in cell \ninvasion and migration  Jacquemet et al  2015  it is tempting \nto speculate that filopodia may contribute to DCIS COM cell in-\nvasion through the microenvironment  however  this hypothesis \nremains to be formally tested \n\nFilopodia density in 3D spheroids\nWithin a 3D environment  MCF10A and MCF10A-derived cell \nlines form spheroids encapsulated within a basement membrane \nthat is believed to better recapitulate the in vivo situation  To \ninvestigate whether these MCF10A cell line–derived spheroids \nalso exhibit distinct filopodia similar to those observed in 2D \n Figs  5 and 6  we plated single MCF10A  MCF10AT  and \nDCIS COM cells on GFR Matrigel and monitored filopodia for-\nmation in spheroids at different time points after plating using a \nconfocal microscope  Fig  7 A  Strikingly  DCIS COM spher-\noids displayed very prominent edge filopodia at days 7 and 14 \nafter plating compared with MCF10A or MCF10AT spheroids \n Fig  7 A  These dense arrays of filopodia persisted in the larger \nDCIS COM spheroids at day 21 after plating  Fig  7 B  We an-\nalyzed filopodia density in MCF10A and DCIS COM spheroids \nat day 5  using single z planes  see Fig  S4 A for details on \nthe imaging plane  when the entire spheroid was still relatively \nsmall and could therefore be accommodated within the imag-\ning window at high magnification and resolution  requirement \nfor filopodia detection  using an SDC microscope  Fig  7 C  \nQuantification of filopodia density using FiloQuant clearly \ndemonstrated extensive filopodia assembly in DCIS COM cells \nat the spheroid edge  whereas in MCF10A spheroids  filopodia \nwere largely absent from the borders  Figs  7 C and S4 B \n\nTo investigate filopodia dynamics in 3D  DCIS COM \nLifeAct cells were plated as single cells on GFR Matrigel and \nallowed to form spheroids for 3 d before being imaged live \nusing an SDC microscope  Video 7  Filopodia were then auto-\n\nmatically detected and tracked using FiloQuant and TrackMate \n Fig   7  D and Video  7  These analyses revealed that  in 3D  \nDCIS COM cells can produce extremely stable filopodia with a \nlong lifetime approaching 40–50 min  Fig  7 D \n\nTumor spheroids generate filopodia in vivo\nWe next sought to investigate whether DCIS COM filopodia \nobserved in vitro are present in vivo using intravital micros-\ncopy  Specifically  DCIS COM LifeAct cells were injected as \nsingle cells into the pericardial cavity of zebrafish embryos \nand imaged live 24 h after injection using an SDC microscope \n Fig  8 A  DCIS COM cells were able to survive in the pericar-\ndial cavity and to form 3D spheroids similar to those observed \nin 3D GFR Matrigel  Fig  8  B and C  High-resolution intravi-\ntal imaging of these tumors revealed the presence of dense filo-\npodial networks at the spheroid border  Fig  8  C–E  and Videos \n8 and 9  thus confirming that filopodia formation is not limited \nto in vitro cultures and that filopodia are generated in vivo by \nthe invasive DCIS COM breast cancer cells \n\nAltogether  we developed FiloQuant  a novel software that \ncan be successfully applied in different settings to detect and \nquantify properties of filopodia and filopodia-like protrusions  \nUsing FiloQuant  we focused on investigating the presence and \ndynamics of filopodia in cell models reflecting different stages \nof breast cancer progression  however  we expect that FiloQuant \nwould also be useful in quantifying filopodia in other contexts \nand/or to quantify other finger-like protrusions such as retrac-\ntion fibers or nanotubes  In addition  despite the broad functions \noffered by the software  we appreciate that other users may re-\nquire extra functionalities or the ability to include FiloQuant \nwithin larger analysis routines  To this end  and to facilitate easy \nmodification  the simple ImageJ macro language used to gener-\nate FiloQuant has been fully annotated  software 1–3  and can \ntherefore be edited with limited coding knowledge  For easy \ninstallation and rapid distribution  we have also deposited Fil-\noQuant on an ImageJ Update site  see Materials and methods \n\nDiscussion\n\nThe extensive employment of filopodia in vivo by different cell \ntypes  as well as the mounting in vitro and clinical evidence \nlinking filopodia and/or filopodia regulatory pathways to disease \n Jacquemet et al  2015  emphasizes the need for more com-\nprehensive analyses of filopodia function  Here  we developed \nFiloQuant  an ImageJ-based computational tool  to simplify \nquantification of filopodia  and we applied this tool to

the detection and \nquantification of filopodia and other finger-like protrusions that \nextend out from the cell edge   2  FiloQuant currently works \nonly on 2D images and does not yet support 3D analyses  We \nanticipate that the filopodia analysis pipeline used here could \nbe translated to work with reconstructed 3D images  The main \nlimitation in studying filopodia in 3D stems from the lack of \nimaging strategies with sufficient axial resolution to enable suc-\ncessful reconstruction and separation of individual filopodia  \nFurthermore  FiloQuant is unable to measure filopodia dipping \nbetween z-planes in a 3D z projection  resulting in underesti-\nmation of filopodia length in such instances   3  FiloQuant will \nnot work well on noisy images or images taken with insufficient \nresolution to separate individual filopodia  see FiloQuant man-\nual for advice on sample preparation and imaging strategies to \noptimize filopodia detection and segmentation  For instance  \nFiloQuant did not successfully identify the filopodia in the im-\nages presented in Figs  5 A  7 B  and Fig  8   4  Finally  Filo-\nQuant can underestimate true filopodia length in some cases  \nsuch as when filopodia originate from the cell body  only the \npart extending out from the edge is measured  when filopo-\ndia intersect each other  when filopodia density is very high  or \nwhen the filopodium intensity is extremely weak  Future work \nwill aim at refining filopodia tracing to improve the robustness \nof filopodia length quantification  Problems associated with \nhigh

invasion or 3D spher-\noid assays  filopodia were first detected and analyzed using the au-\ntomated version of FiloQuant and the “stack analysis” option  In \naddition  filopodia further than 40 pixels away from the detected cell \nedge were excluded using the “maximal distance from cell edges” \noption  The tracking file generated by FiloQuant was then used as \nan input for TrackMate  an automated tracking software freely \navailable within ImageJ  Tinevez et al  2017  TrackMate was \nchosen over other available ImageJ tracking plugins because of its \nuser-friendly interface and high flexibility  In TrackMate  the LoG \n\ndetector  estimated bob diameter = 0 1 µm  threshold = 10  subpixel \nlocalization enabled  and the simple LAP tracker  linking max dis-\ntance = 1 µm  gap-closing max distance = 1 µm  gap-closing max \nframe gap = 1  were used \n\nManual tracking analyses\nThe manual tracking analyses  related to Fig  6  C and D  were per-\nformed in ImageJ using

on the rise and accounts for a leading cause of mortality  An understanding of \n\nthe knowledge and practices on breast cancer and breast self-examination  BSE  among teachers are important first steps which will guide the \n\ndesigning of interventions aimed at raising awareness across the general population  Methods  We conducted a cross-sectional study in April 2016 \n\ninvolving 345 consenting female undergraduate students in the Higher Teachers Training College  Bambili  Cameroon  Data was collected using a \n\npretested self-administered questionnaire and analysed using descriptive methods  Results  The mean age of the respondents was 22 5±3 2years \n\nand a vast majority  n = 304  88 1%  had heard about BCa primarily from the television/radio  n=196  64 5%  Overall  less than a quarter  n=65  \n\n21 4%  of respondents who had heard about BCa had sufficient knowledge on its risk factors and signs/symptoms  A plurality  53 3%  thought \n\nBCa can be prevented via vaccination while over a third  38 7%  opined that BCa can be treated spiritually  Less than half  47%  of respondents \n\nwho had heard about BCa had heard about BSE amongst which only 55  38 5%  had ever practiced it  Conclusion  Though most students are \n\naware of the existence of breast cancer  their overall knowledge on its risk factors and clinical presentation is insufficient with a concomitant low \n\npractice of BSE  These highlighted gaps warrants intensification of sensitization campaigns and educational programmes in order to raise \n\nknowledge levels and enhance prevention strategies that would aid in reducing the burden of breast cancer in Cameroon  \n\n \n\n \n\nPan African Medical Journal  2017  28 91 doi 10 11604/pamj 2017 28 91 10986 \n\nThis article is available

the second most frequent cancer and \nthe fifth cause of cancer-related mortality [1]  It is the most \ncommon cancer to affect women and it is second only to lung \ncancer as the principal cause of cancer-related deaths among \nwomen [1-3]  In low- and middle-income countries  LMICs  it \nremains a significant public health challenge as incidence rates have \nbeen shown to increase yearly by as much as 5% with over 1 \nmillion projected new cases annually by 2020 [2-5]  The emergence \nof breast disease and subsequent development of cancer appears to \nbe more aggressive in young women compared to its progression in \nolder women [6 7]  In 2008  the prevalence of breast cancer in \nwomen ≥15 years in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 23 5 per \n100 000 women and approximately 35 427 women died from the \ndisease  crude mortality rate of 12 8 per 100 000 women  [8 9]  In \nCameroon  the incidence of breast cancer is higher than the worlds \naverage  estimated at 2625 per 100 000 women with a resultant \nhigh mortality [3 5]  The high morbidity and mortality due to breast \ncancer can be in-part reduced if the lesion is detected early enough \n[2]  In this regard  women need to be \"breast aware\" by being able \nto identify the risk factors and symptoms of breast cancer as well as \nrisk reduction strategies  \n  \nThough still clouded in controversy  breast self-examination  BSE  \nstill has an important role to play in the early detection of breast \ncancer in resource-constraint settings where routine clinical breast \nexamination and mammography may not be feasible  In such \nsettings  BSE is recommended because it is free  private  painless  \neasy  safe  and requires no specific equipment  It has also been \nshown to improve breast health awareness and thus potentially \nallow for early detection of breast anomalies [10-13]  The American \nCancer Society also recommends that women from the age of 20 \nyears onwards should be educated on the benefits of performing \nBSE monthly [14]  It had been demonstrated that factors related to \nwomen´s awareness  knowledge and perceptions about breast \ncancer may contribute significantly to medical help-seeking \nbehaviours [15-17]  Thus  considering the potential pivotal role \nplayed by teachers in information dissemination  this study sought \nto assess the awareness  knowledge and perceptions of breast \ncancer and practice of breast self-examination among female \nundergraduate students in a higher institution of teaching as this \nwill be essential in informing policy for targeted interventions \nthrough the provision of guided educational training programs  \n  \n  \n\nMethods \n \nStudy design  setting and participants  We conducted a \ndescriptive cross-sectional study on the 11th of April 2016 at the \nHigher Teachers Training College  HTTC  Bambili  University of \nBamenda in the Northwest Region of Cameroon  Bambili is a centre \nof attraction for a youthful multi-ethnic population who either move \nthere for studies or to explore the diverse economic activities \ntriggered by the presence of the university  The undergraduate \nprogram in HTTC is a three year course and annually  this college \ngraduates about 500 trained teachers  The target population was \nfirst cycle female undergraduate students  To consider equal \nchances of participation  the students were informed about a free \nand voluntary participation in a breast cancer survey 1 week earlier \nvia oral message during lecture hours  On the said day of the \nsurvey  students were consecutively approached in their respective \nlecture halls for inclusion  \n  \nStudy procedures and data collection  A structured and self-\nadministered questionnaire was developed by the researchers after \n\nan extensive review of literature [10-12 18]  The validity of its \ncontents was established through consultation with experts and was \npretested on 41 first cycle students from HTTC who were eventually \nrestrained from participating in the final study  Other than concerns \nabout some ambiguous words which were simplified in the revised \nversion  all pilot students reported they easily understood the \nquestionnaire  It had three sections  socio-demographic \ncharacteristics  knowledge about breast cancer  and a section on \nBSE  Data collection facilitators  1 student per academic level  \nunderwent a 2-hour training one day prior to the census  Coding of \nquestionnaires rather than using names was done in order to ensure \nconfidentiality  Consenting participants were handed printed copies \nof the questionnaire and allowed time to fill their responses and \nreturn them anonymously to the facilitators  The completeness of \nreturned questionnaires was visually checked on a daily basis by the \nprincipal investigators  The study was approved by the ethics \ncommittee of the regional delegation of public health for the \nNorthwest Region and all recruited students signed a consent form  \n  \nScoring of knowledge  Each of the questions on knowledge of \nrisk factors and clinical presentation  signs/symptoms  of breast \ncancer was equitably scored  Categorical responses  Yes/No/Don't \nknow  were applied for the question items  We assigned one point \n 1  to a correct answer and zero  0  for don't know or an incorrect \nanswer  The overall knowledge score was calculated by summing \nscores of all knowledge questions  16 on risk factors and 12 on \nsigns/symptoms  yielding a possible range of overall scores from 0 \nto 28  Scores were divided into two categories  insufficient \nknowledge    30 2 0 6 \n\nReligion \n  \n\nChristian 313 90 7 \n\nMuslim 24 6 9 \n\nOthers 8 2 3 \n\nMarital status \n  \n\nMarried 62

than 50% of breast\npatients suffer from chronic postoperative pain and\nte analgesia [3] This type of pain often disturbs patients \nmonstrates that insufﬁcient conventional painmanagement\nble for relief [2] Therefore  multiple pain management\nare often applied to postoperative pain control \n\nmy [9] and cholecystectomy [10] It has also reported that\npatients who received TPVBRA often involved less nausea\nand vomiting [5] In addition  it can not only shorten the\nrecovery time  reduce analgesics consumption  but can also\ndecrease total surgery cost [5] Although the use of TPVBRA can\neither improve the quality and duration of sensory neural\nblockade or reduce the consumption dose of local and\nsupplemental analgesia [11] no systematic review or meta-\nanalysis of TPVBRA for the usage of breast cancer surgery is\navailable presently \nDexmedetomidine is a highly selective a2 agonist  It has\n\nsedative and analgesic properties and produces dose-dependent\nanalgesia without respiratory depression [12] It has been reported\nthat dexmedetomidine can produce analgesia in experimental\nanimals [13] prolong the duration of action of spinal bupiva-\ncaine [14] and can potentiate the effect of spinal morphine in\npatients with cancer pain [15]\n\nThis study aimed to test the hypothesis that the efﬁcacy of\nTPVBRA combined with bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine is\nsuperior to TPVBRA with bupivacaine alone in patients\nundergoing breast cancer surgery \n\n2  Material and methods\n\nandomized controlled trial was approved by the Medical\nl Committee of The

to other ethnicities and other hospitals  Third  patients\nalso received general anesthesia  which may have affected this\nstudy  the observed effect may have been the result of the\nsynergistic

in patients with\nmetastatic breast cancer  The heterogeneity of intrapatient AR expression in CTCs leads to\nthe new hypothesis that patients with AR+ CTCs have heterogeneous disease with multiple\ndrivers  Further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical applicability of AR+ CTCs\nand their heterogeneity \n\nIntroduction\nAndrogen receptor  AR  is a nuclear transcription factor in the steroid hormone receptor\n\nsuperfamily  AR activation by binding to ligand  dihydrotestosterone  induces a conforma-\n\ntional change in AR  upon which the activated dimerized AR translocates from the cytoplasm\n\nto the nucleus  where along with co-activators  co-repressors and other transcriptional pro-\n\nteins  binds to an androgen-response element  AREs  in the promoter and enhancer regions \n\nleading to transcription of key genes encoding proteins related to growth and proliferation [1 \n\n2]  The biology of AR and its therapeutic importance have been investigated extensively in\n\nprostate cancer [3–7]  However  the role of AR in breast cancer needs to be more investigated \n\nRecently  it has become clear that AR plays a critical role in normal and malignant breast\n\ntissue [8–10]  AR expression has been reported in over 70% of estrogen receptor  ER -positive\n\n ER+  breast cancers  approximately 60% of HER2-positive  HER2+  breast cancers  and 30%\n\nto 45% of triple-negative breast cancers  TNBCs  [11–15]  Some studies showed that in hor-\n\nmone receptor  HR -positive  HR+  breast cancers  AR expression is associated with resis-\n\ntance to anti-estrogen therapies [16  17]  In contrast  there are some articles demonstrating\n\nthat AR positivity is associated with better survival in ER+ tumors [18  19]  Recent studies\n\nshowed the heterogeneity of AR expression depending especially on ER positivity and the ER\n\npositivity in the context of AR seems to be important to predict survival or hormonal therapy\n\nsensitivity [15  18  20]  Our analysis of a public data set showed that HER2 expression level was\n\nsignificantly higher in AR-positive  AR+  than in AR-negative  AR-  tumors  P = 0 039  In\n\nthe TNBC molecular subclassification reported by Pietenpol et al  AR-expressing TNBC is\n\nclassified as a distinct subtype  luminal AR  LAR  [21  22]  Interestingly  LAR subtype has a\n\ngene expression profile similar to that of the luminal A and B subtypes [21]  AR-targeting\n\ndrugs such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide have been tested in clinical trials in breast cancer\n\npatients [9  10]  However  despite these emerging data  the role of AR in breast cancers is still\n\nnot fully elucidated and the biology of AR in breast cancer remains incompletely understood \n\nCurrently  AR expression in breast cancer is defined on the basis of immunohistochemical\n\n IHC  staining  However  there is no clear definition of AR positivity [9  10  18]  Moreover  the\n\nrelationship between AR protein expression on IHC staining and ARmRNA expression needs\nto be validated  One study showed that gene expression profiling might be superior to IHC for\n\npredicting AR-target therapy [23]  Hierarchial clustering analysis using gene expression signa-\n\nture classified patients into two groups  PREDICT AR-positive and PREDICT AR-negative\n\nwhich has 80% sensitivity and 65% specificity in prediction of clinical benefit rate from enzalu-\n\ntamide [23  24]  Finally  while novel therapeutics to target the AR pathway in breast cancer\n\nare being developed  no biomarkers are currently available to track changes in AR expression\nin the blood over time in response to AR-targeting treatment  a strategy known as “liquid\n\nbiopsy ”\n\nAndrogen receptor expression on CTCs in metastatic breast

DNA  ctDNA  circulating RNA  proteomics  and metabolomics have been\n\ndeveloping  Accumulating evidence suggests that CTCs may be tumor-specific biomarkers of\n\nresponse to therapy  CTCs have been reported to be a surrogate marker for tumor treatment\n\nresponse  and the presence of CTCs has been linked to shorter survival in patients with meta-\n\nstatic breast  prostate  colorectal  and lung cancer [25–31]  CTCs are thought to spread into the\n\nbloodstream when cancers undergo metastatic dissemination and spread to distant organs \n\nsuggesting that the presence or number of CTCs may be useful as a marker of early relapse or a\n\ntool for early assessment of treatment efficacy [28  32]  Understanding of the molecular profile\n\nof CTCs may facilitate development of personalized treatment strategies  which can help pa-\n\ntients avoid unnecessary or ineffective treatments [33–35]  CTCs carry specific oncogenic\n\nmutations  indicating that CTCs can be used to monitor genetic changes in disseminating can-\n\ncers [36–38]  In a study of 254 patients with metastatic breast cancer  33% of patients with\n\nHER2-negative  HER2-  primary tumors had HER2+ CTCs [39]  suggesting that CTCs could\n\nbe used to identify patients with disease sensitive to HER2-targeted therapies regardless of pri-\n\nmary tumor HER2 expression and could be used to construct personalized treatment strate-\n\ngies  Among patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer  those with AR-V7-positive\n\nCTCs before AR inhibitor treatment showed shorter radiographic progression-free survival \n\nshorter time on therapy  and shorter overall survival than those without AR-V7-positive CTCs\n\n[40] \n\nAt present  the only Food and Drug Administration  FDA -approved platform for the enu-\n\nmeration of CTCs is the CellSearch system  which uses cell-surface epithelial cell adhesion\n\nmolecule  EpCAM  for CTC enrichment  To improve the sensitivity of CTC detection  Epic\n\nSciences has developed a platform that uses a non-enrichment-based non-biased approach\n\nallowing for enumeration and characterization of all CTCs  including traditional CTCs  cyto-\n\nkeratin [CK] positive [CK+]  CD45 negative [CD45-]  and morphologically distinct  CK-neg-\n\native  CK-  CTCs  apoptotic CTCs  CTC clusters  groups of 2 or more adjacent CTCs with\n\nshared cytoplasmic boundaries  and small CTCs  CK+/CD45-  morphologically similar to\n\nwhite blood cells  The Epic Sciences platform can be used to quantitatively measure protein\n\nexpression via immunofluorescence  to differentiate protein subcellular localization  and to\n\nperform simultaneous detection of fluorescence in situ hybridization  FISH  on the same cells \n\nAnother benefit of this platform is its ability to detect and molecularly characterize CTCs from\n\nblood samples cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen  in which the relative abundance of CTCs and\n\nprotein biomarker  CK  AR  expression remains largely consistent with the values in matched\n\nfresh samples  Morphology  biomarker expression  localization  and genetic alterations\n\nassessed via FISH are preserved in archived CTCs  enabling retrospective biomarker studies in\n\nlarger cohorts with detailed clinical histories [41] \n\nGiven that AR-targeted therapies are under development  there is an urgent need to better\n\nunderstand the biology of AR in breast cancer  Also  longitudinal follow-up of AR expression\n\nin CTCs might be a future predictive biomarker for AR-targeted therapy  In this preliminary\n\nstudy  we used the Epic Sciences platform to identify CTCs in patients with metastatic breast\n\ncancer and determine AR protein expression and genomic analysis of the identified CTCs

collection and processing\nFor this study  a single blood sample was obtained from each patient  Blood  10 mL  was col-\n\nlected in cell-free preservative blood collection tubes  Streck  Omaha  NE  Blood samples\n\nwere sent at ambient temperature to Epic Sciences and processed within 96 hours of blood\n\ndraw using previously described methods [42–47]  Briefly  red blood cells were lysed  3 x 106\n\nnucleated blood cells/slide were deposited on up to 12 glass slides per sample  and slides were\n\nstored at -80˚C for long-term storage \n\nFor CTC identification and biomarker staining in CTCs  2 slides per patient sample were\n\nthawed and immunostained with an antibody cocktail to detect CK  CD45  DAPI  and bio-\n\nmarkers of interest  AR  ER  and HER2  rabbit monoclonal antibodies from Cell Signaling\n\nTechnology  Danvers  MA  USA  CK  CD45  and DAPI were used to detect and enumerate\n\nCTCs  AR  ER  and HER2 were biomarkers of interest  Stained slides were scanned and images\n\nwere analyzed using a multiparametric digital pathology algorithm to determine CTC enumer-\n\nation and biomarker expression on CTCs as previously described [42]  A tyramide signal\n\namplification system was utilized for the AR and ER detection to increase the fluorescence sig-\n\nnal intensity  Following immunofluorescence staining  slides were stored at -80˚C until down-\n\nstream genomic analysis \n\nCTC identification\nAs we previously reported [41]  fluorescent scanners and morphology algorithms were used to\n\nidentify CK+ CTCs  CTC clusters  CK- CTCs  and apoptotic CTCs  CK+ CTCs were defined\n\nas CK+  CD45- CTCs with intact DAPI that were larger than and morphologically distinct\n\nfrom WBC  CTC clusters were defined as groups of 2 or more adjacent CTCs with shared\n\ncytoplasmic boundaries  CK- CTCs were defined as CK-  CD45- CTCs with intact DAPI \n\nApoptotic CTCs were defined as CK+  CD45- CTCs with a DAPI pattern of chromosomal\n\ncondensation and/or nuclear fragmentation/blebbing consistent with the classic definition of\n\napoptosis  Identified CTCs were grouped into 2 categories  traditional CTCs  CK+ CTCs or\n\nCK+ CTC clusters  and all CTC candidates  CK+ CTCs  CTC clusters  CK- CTCs  and apopto-\n\ntic CTCs  Clinical laboratory cytologists  licensed in California  conducted the final quality\n\ncontrol of CTCs identified  CTC+ was defined as 1 or more CTCs detected \n\nAR  ER  and HER2 assay development\nThe specificity of AR  ER  and HER2 assays was evaluated using assay-specific positive and\n\nnegative cell line controls  As shown in Panel A in S1 Fig  when cell lines known to be AR posi-\n\ntive  VCaP  and AR negative  PC3  on the basis of gene expression were stained with the AR\n\nassay  AR expression was found only in the AR-positive VCaP cells  AR expression in VCaP\n\ncells was also found to be localized in the nucleus  further confirming AR-specific staining and\n\nperformance of the assay  Panel B S1 Fig  For the AR assay  at the optimal antibody concen-\n\ntration  the mean signal from positive control VCaP was 46-fold higher than the mean signal\n\nfrom the negative control \n\nAs shown in Panel C and D in S1 Fig  when ER-positive  MCF-7  and ER-negative\n\n MDA-MB-231  control cell lines were stained  ER expression was observed only in the ER-\n\npositive MCF-7 cell line  At the optimal antibody concentration  the mean signal from positive\n\ncontrol MCF-7 was 31-fold higher than mean signal from the negative control \n\nAndrogen

the underlying cellular and\n\npotential genomic heterogeneity  we sequenced CTCs from a patient with AR+/HR+/HER2-\n\ntumor tissue on IHC staining  Single-cell CTC isolation and next-generation sequencing\n\n NGS  library preparation were performed as previously described [48]  The independent\n\nCTCs were subjected to single-cell sequencing for copy number variation  CNV  analysis by\n\nusing Epic’s single-cell data analysis pipelines [49]  Briefly  AR-stained  ER-stained  and\n\nHER2-stained slides from 1 patient were thawed  and CK+ or CK- CTCs  not including CTC\n\nclusters

suggests that AR+ CTCs had a cellular origin\n\ndistinct from that of the AR- CTCs  Fig 4C  The white blood cell sequenced as a germline con-\n\ntrol showed no genomic  CNV  changes \n\nDiscussion\nOur findings from this study show that the Epic Sciences CTC platform  which uses a non-\n\nenrichment-based non-biased approach  can be used to identify CTCs in patients with meta-\n\nstatic breast cancer and to identify AR expression in those CTCs  These preliminary results\n\nsuggest that CTC AR expression identified using this approach has potential as a biomarker\n\nfor identifying patients who might benefit from AR therapy and suggest that this approach\n\nshould be clinically validated  We detected traditional CTCs  CK+ CTCs and CK+ clusters  in\n\nmore than 50% of the 68 patients in this study and all CTC candidates in 75% of them  We\n\ndetected CTCs in more than 90% of the patients with HR+/HER2- tumors and approximately\n\n60% of the patients with the other tumor types  HR+/HER2+  HR-/HER2+  and TNBC \n\nIn terms of the reproducibility of the current non-enrichment-based non-biased approach\n\nto identify CTCs  CK- CTCs were determined by a combination of morphology and bio-\n\nmarker expression  for example  large cells with high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio  irregular\n\nnuclear contours  and high AR expression  We previously reported an association between\n\nhigher detection of non-traditional CTCs  including apoptotic CTCs  CK- CTCs  and CTC\n\nclusters  and worse overall survival in metastatic prostate cancer [51]  In a separate cohort of\n\npatients with metastatic prostate cancer  we demonstrated that CK- CTCs was an independent\n\nprognostic factor for short overall survival and an additive prognostic factor for OS together\n\nwith PSA level  line of therapies  and presence of visceral metastasis in multivariate analysis\n\n[52]  Further  sequencing of these CK-/AR+ CTCs revealed frequent AR gene amplifications as\nwell as other alterations that are consistent with prostate cancer  These data suggest that the\n\nidentified CK- CTCs were real tumor cells in prostate cancer  Further evidence supporting the\n\nreproducibility of our current method is that in 21 samples from 20 healthy donors  no CTCs\n\nwere detected [51]  These findings indicate that the CTC identification method used in our\n\npresent study has a high degree of specificity in the detection of CK- CTCs \n\nTo further understand the difference of genomic profiles for each CTC with different bio-\n\nmarker positivity  we have sequenced 78 CTCs and 1 WBC from a patient who had HR\n\n+/HER2- disease on tissue biopsy  Our finding that this patient had not only ER+ and AR\n\n+ but also HER2+ CTCs even though IHC staining of the tissue biopsy specimen showed no\n\nHER2 expression suggests a potential discordance between the tissue and CTCs  A similar dis-\n\ncordance was observed in a previous study wherein 33% of patients with HER2- primary\n\ntumors had HER2+ CTCs [53] \n\nOur genomic analysis of the CTCs in this 1 patient revealed 3 major genomic patterns  pat-\n\ntern A  which had amplification in chromosomal regions chr8p11-p12 and chr11q13-q14  pat-\n\ntern B  similar to pattern A but with an additional partial deletion of chr6  and pattern C  with\n\nno significant copy number changes  Amplification of chr8p11-p12 was previously reported to\n\nbe common in breast cancer  occurring in 12%-15% of cases  and its presence correlated with\n\npoor patient outcome [54]  Amplification of oncogenes KAT6A and NSD3  previously known\nas WHSC1L1  in this region may be involved in driving tumor cell growth and carcinogenesis\n[54]  Amplification of chr11q13-q14  a less frequent event in breast cancer  was also reported\n\nin a previous study [55]  The PAK1 and SF1 genes are located on this region  PAK1 amplifica-\ntion may play a key role in MAPK activation  and SF1 amplification may predict therapeutic\nresistance to adjuvant tamoxifen therapy [55]  While most of the ER+ and HER2+ CTCs\n\nAndrogen receptor expression on CTCs in metastatic breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0185231 September 28  2017 10 / 16\n\n\n\n\nsequenced had either pattern A or pattern B  Fig 4C  only 50% of the AR+ CTCs sequenced\n\nhad pattern A or B  and the other 50% had pattern C  suggesting a different cell of origin for\n\npattern C  This also suggests that acquisition of AR may be an early event or may happen\n\nthrough a different mechanism during tumorigenesis or in response to treatment  Epic Sci-\n\nences has previously reported that in prostate cancer  high phenotypic heterogeneity identifies\n\npatients with increased risk of death during treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide [56] \n\nThese results demonstrate that single-cell sequencing of CTCs can be utilized to understand\n\nthe cellular heterogeneity among CTCs and also to explore the mechanisms of treatment\n\nresponse or resistance to develop new treatment regimens  Not all CTCs had abnormal geno-\n\nmic DNA copy number profiles  i e  CTCs with pattern C  their cancer origin was determined\n\nby their CK expressions  tumor biomarker expressions and/or cancer cell morphology  Further\n\ntargeted sequencing analysis might help to identify the driver mutation for these subset of\n\ncells \n\nOne of the limitations of our current study is that we were not able to co-stain multiple\n\nmarkers of interest on the same slides owing to technical and resource limitations and thus\n\ncould not investigate the possibility of co-expression of AR  ER  and HER2 in each CTC \n\nAnother limitation relates to the threshold for biomarkers  The 95th percentile is a commonly\n\nacceptable threshold for development of FDA-approved immunofluorescence and IHC in\n\nvitro diagnosis assays  We applied the same rigor to the CTC-based immunofluorescence\n\nassay in the current study  However  because the study was preliminary  we did not have an\n\nappropriate clinical variable such as clinical outcome to use for sensitivity analysis to set the\n\nthreshold for specific clinical questions  Another study is warranted to validate the threshold\n\nfor biomarkers \n\nIn conclusion  these preliminary results suggest the need for clinical validation of CTC AR\n\nexpression as a potential biomarker to identify patients who might benefit from AR therapy \n\nThe intrapatient heterogeneity of CTC AR expression leads to the hypothesis that patients\n\nwith AR+ CTCs might have heterogeneous disease with multiple drivers  Further studies are\n\nwarranted to serially monitor changes in AR and to investigate the clinical applicability of AR\n\n+ CTCs and their heterogeneity at the genomic level with full sequencing  In the future  we\n\nplan to apply this technology to make a model to predict patients who are more or less sensi-\n\ntive to AR signaling inhibitors such as enzalutamide in prospective clinical trials \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig  AR  ER  HER2 assay development

\n\nConclusions\nPreoperatively  positive indication for systemic therapy is highly accurate  Negative indica-\ntion is highly accurate  96%  for tumors sized 2 0cm on DCE-MRI and with PME PDE\nratios on 31P-MRS \n\nIntroduction\nIn the past decades  breast cancer treatment has become less invasive  for example from mas-\n\ntectomy to breast conserving therapy  without compromising overall disease-free survival\n\n[1 2]  Further progress in individualized treatment involves changing the order of treatment \n\nfor example preoperative radiotherapy [3] or preoperative chemotherapy [4]  yielding the\n\nadvantage to monitor tumor response in vivo  Also  more experimental minimally invasive\n\ntumor ablation techniques are currently investigated  such as radio-frequency ablation[5] \n\ncryoablation[6]  and high-intensity focused ultrasound[7 8]  Progress is  however  hampered\n\nbecause the postoperative resection specimen—the golden standard for tumor characteriza-\n\ntion—is no longer available to guide treatment  Preoperative tumor biopsy  combined with\n\nconventional breast imaging  and with assessment of lymph nodes with ultrasound and fine-\n\nneedle aspiration  shows discordance with postoperative assessment of the resection specimen \n\nThis discordance is as high as 40% for tumor grade and mitotic count[9 10]  and impacts the\n\nability to accurately omit systemic therapy  Consequently  current guidelines for the indication\n\nof systemic therapy cannot easily be translated to preoperative setting for early-stage breast\n\ncancer[11]  As a result  early-stage breast cancer patients do not benefit from the advantages of\n\nneoadjuvant treatments tailored to the response of cancer  Hence  more accurate preoperative\n\ncharacterization is desirable to reach the same level of confidence as that from a resection\n\nspecimen \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging  MRI  visualizes several aspects of tumor biology  For\n\ninstance  dynamic contrast-enhanced  DCE -MRI indirectly visualizes angiogenesis[12]  and\n\nis typically used for local tumor staging  MR diffusion-weighted imaging  MR-DWI  visualizes\n\nthe ability of water molecules to move freely inside tumors  providing a measure of how cha-\n\notic cells have been laid out  It has been investigated for several applications[13 14]  including\n\ncancer differentiation  although results were not consistent[15–18]  Thirdly  magnetic reso-\n\nnance spectroscopy  MRS  visualizes the metabolism of cancers  In particular  31-Phosphorus\n\nMR spectroscopy  31P-MRS  measures the phosphorus components in tumors  which play an\n\nimportant role in the forming of new cell membranes[19]  However  conventional MRI scan-\n\nners lack the ability to do 31P-MRS  because phosphorus components are not highly abundant\n\nin the human body  Recent MRI scanners with high magnetic field strength at 7 tesla  T  have\n\nbeen able to detect these components in breast cancers \n\nIn order to increase the confidence of preoperative indication for systemic therapy to the\n\nsame level as that obtained from the surgically excised tissue  we hypothesized that combining\n\nseveral MRI modalities  i e  multiparametric imaging  prior to surgery provides complemen-\n\ntary information  The objective of this study is to use multiparametric breast MRI at high field\n\nPreoperative indication for systemic therapy in breast cancer using multiparametric 7-tesla MRI\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183855 September 26  2017 2 /

indi-\n\ncated for systemic therapy and patients who are not indicated \n\nMaterials and methods\nPatients were included from the PROFILE  Patient Risk based On Functional MRI  study  All\nwomen in this study had histologically proven invasive breast cancer eligible for breast con-\n\nserving therapy based on conventional imaging  Exclusion criteria were prior surgery  prior\n\nradiotherapy of the ipsilateral breast  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  and typical contraindica-\n\ntions for MRI  Patients were consecutively recruited from the University Medical Center\n\nUtrecht and the Albert Schweitzer hospital in Dordrecht  Approval for this study was obtained\n\nfrom the institutional review board of the University Medical Center Utrecht and written\n\ninformed consent was obtained from all patients  A total of 46 patients are described in this\n\nstudy  of which 14 patients were reported earlier in an explorative study considering the poten-\n\ntial of multiparametric 7-tesla breast MRI to characterize breast cancer [18] \n\nConventional diagnostic workup\nPreoperatively  tumor size was assessed by the largest tumor diameter on ultrasound or mam-\n\nmographic imaging  Ultrasound-guided 14-Gauge tumor biopsies of the invasive lesions were\n\nacquired  and histopathology was obtained  Biopsy-derived tumor tissue was stained using\n\nhematoxyline and eosine  H&E  Tumor grade was assessed according to the modified Bloom\n\nand Richardson guidelines[20]  Mitotic count was assessed as the number of mitotic figures\n\nper 2 mm2  Tumor type and estrogen receptor  ER  status were assessed on H&E slides  For\n\nER  a 10% staining threshold was used to differentiate between a positive   10%  and a nega-\n\ntive   2 3 mm \n\nPostoperatively  the resection specimen was treated according to a protocol adapted from\n\nEgan et al  [21]as described earlier[18]  In short  the resection specimen was cut in approxi-\n\nmately 4 mm thick slices and fixed in formalin overnight  The slice containing the largest\n\ntumor diameter was chosen as representative for tumor characterization  Tumor size was\n\nassessed macro and microscopically  Tumor grade  mitotic count  tumor type  and receptor\n\nstatus was examined using procedures comparable with the assessment of the biopsy-derived\n\ntissue  A positive lymph node was defined as a lymph node containing macro or microscopic\n\ndisease on sentinel node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection when available \n\nIndication for systemic therapy\nThe risk of 10-year mortality and 10-year relapse were estimated using the web-based tool\n\nAdjuvant Online  AOL   version 8 0  which is based on the SEER database and validated in\n\nmultiple countries[22–24]  The AOL estimates were obtained twice for each patient  once\n\nusing preoperative information only and once using postoperative information  Hence  patient\n\nage at diagnosis  and characteristics from the primary tumor were entered from preoperative\n\nor postoperative assessment  ER-status  tumor grade  tumor size  and number of positive\n\nlymph nodes  Co-morbidity was set to default  ‘minor problems’  Missing data was set to\n\n‘undefined’  The indication for systemic therapy was based on the Dutch national guidelines\n\n www oncoline nl  In accordance with these guidelines an indication for systemic therapy was\n\ngiven when either the predicted risk of 10-year mortality was equal or higher than 15%  or\n\nwhen the predicted risk of 10-year relapse was equal or higher than 25% \n\nPreoperative indication

medicine requires accurate detection and char-acterisation of tumours for tailoring personalised therapiesto improve healthcare of cancer patients  Non-invasive\nsensitive imaging of tumour markers is essential for accurate\ncancer detection and characterisation of tumour aggressiveness1 \nMagnetic resonance imaging  MRI  is a powerful clinical imaging\nmodality that provides high-resolution three-dimensional images\nof soft tissues  Magnetic resonance  MR  molecular imaging or\nmolecular MRI of cancer biomarkers can facilitate non-invasive\ncancer detection and characterisation  image-guided interventions\nand therapeutic efﬁcacy assessment in cancer precision\nmedicine2  3  High spatial resolution of MRI allows early detection\nof tumours as small as a few hundred cells  a few hundred\nmicrons in size4  Paramagnetic materials  including stable Gd III \nchelates and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles  are\noften used as contrast agents to increase T1 and T2 relaxation\nrates of water protons in the tissues of interest and to produce\ncontrast enhancement for diagnostic imaging5  6  Despite the\ncontinuous efforts in developing novel MRI contrast agents  there\nis a serious lack of safe and effective-targeted contrast agents for\nhigh-sensitivity molecular MRI in clinical practice \nMR signal enhancement is determined by the extent of increase\n\nin the water-proton relaxation rate  which is proportional to both\n\nthe concentration and relaxivity of the contrast agents  Currently \nthe design of targeted MRI contrast agents mostly focuses on\nincreasing their local concentration around the molecular targets \ne g  using nanoparticles with high payloads of paramagnetic\nmaterials7  Various nanosized-targeted contrast agents  including\nsuperparamagnetic iron oxide  Gd III  and Mn II -containing\nnanoparticles8–10  have shown promise in MR molecular imaging \nHowever  because of their low relaxivity  a relatively large dose is\nrequired to produce detectable signal enhancement  High dose of\nnanoparticle contrast agents may cause unintended side effects\ndue to their slow excretion and accumulation in normal tissues11 \n12  Recently  a new strategy of targeting abundant biomarkers in\nthe tumour microenvironment using small peptide conjugates of\nclinical Gd III -based MRI contrast agents has been developed4 \nAlthough this approach facilitates faster excretion of the targeted\ncontrast agents in molecular MRI13  a relatively high dose of these\nagents is still required to generate detectable signal enhancement \nThus  the design and development of better contrast agents\n\nwith high relaxivities is essential to signiﬁcantly improve the\nsensitivity of molecular MRI and to reduce the local concentra-\ntion and dose of the contrast agents  which will minimise\npotential dose-dependent toxic side effects  Recently  gadofuller-\nenes have emerged as a novel class of paramagnetic materials

preventing the release of\ntoxic free Gd III  ions into the body19  The small size  ca  1 nm \nof gadofullerenes also allows for complete clearance from the\nbody via renal ﬁltration  Therefore  targeted gadofullerenes are\npromising targeted MRI contrast agents that can address the\nlimitations and toxicity of the existing MRI contrast agents for\nsafe and sensitive molecular MRI in clinical

ZD2-Gd3N@C80  for sensitive molecular MRI of\nbreast cancer  The targeted contrast agent has a superior T1\nrelaxivity  about 20 times higher than the conventional Gd-based\nMRI contrast agents  The

estimated\nstructure of Gd3N@C80 OH 18 CH2CH2COOH 6  Some of the\ncarboxyl groups in the hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 were then\nconverted into amines  followed by reaction with maleimido-\nopfp  yielding maleimido-Gd3N@C80 for conjugation with thiol-\nbearing ZD2 peptide  Fig  1  An excess of ZD2 peptide was used\nto conjugate to maleimido-Gd3N@C80  The N–H and C–N peaks\nin Fourier transform infrared

The r1 relaxivity of ZD2-Gd3@NC80 is almost\n20 times that of clinical Gd III -based contrast agents  including\nGd-DTPA and Gd HP-DO3A 5  The high r1 relaxivity of\nthe hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 is attributed to strong magnetisa-\ntion of the hydroxyl protons on the cage by the encapsulated Gd\n III  ions and rapid exchange rate of the protons with water\nprotons in the surrounding bulk  This superior relaxivity is\ncritical to improving the sensitivity of contrast enhanced MRI \nespecially T1-weighted MRI  for molecular imaging at low doses\non most clinical scanners with relatively low

levels of EDB-FN in all\nthe TNBC lines were signiﬁcantly higher than those in the\nER-positive cell lines  Fig  3a and Supplementary Fig  2  Western\nblot analysis also revealed abundant expression of EDB-FN in\nMDA-MB-231 tumours and negligible expression in MCF-7\ntumours  Fig  3b  In matrigel-based three-dimensional  3D \nculture  MDA-MB-231 cells were able to form large spherical\nstructures  indicating the aggressive nature of the TNBC cells\n Fig  3c  In contrast  MCF-7 cells formed smaller cell clusters\nwith limited matrigel invasion  suggesting the low invasiveness of\nthe cells  Fig  3c  The MDA-MB-231 spheres incubated with\nZD2-Cy5 5 showed strong ﬂuorescence intensity under confocal\nmicroscopy  indicating high expression of EDB-FN protein\nand strong binding of the peptide

tumours and other major organs at 3 h after injection \nFluorescence intensity was greater in the MDA-MB-231 tumours\nthan the MCF-7 tumours and normal tissues and organs \n\nRelatively high ﬂuorescence signal intensity was seen in the\nliver and kidneys  because the probe is mainly excreted via\nthese organs  EDB-FN expression and ZD2-Cy5 5 binding in\nthe two tumour models were also veriﬁed by correlating\nimmunoﬂuorescence staining of EDB-FN and Cy5 5 ﬂuorescence\nimaging  Fig  3e  MDA-MB-231 tumour sections were rich in\nEDB-FN expression and showed strong Cy5 5 ﬂuorescence \nwhereas little EDB-FN expression and ZD2-Cy5 5 binding were\nseen in the MCF-7 tumour sections  Microscopically  the\naggressive MDA-MB-231 TNBC tumour sections displayed a\nhigher cell density than the ER-positive MCF-7 tumours  Fig  3f \nTaken together  these results validate the strong positive\ncorrelation of EDB-FN expression with tumour aggressiveness\nand the speciﬁc binding of ZD2 peptide to the highly abundant\nEDB-FN in the MDA-MB-231 tumours \nWe next tested whether molecular MRI with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 at\n\n1 Tesla could detect the aggressive MDA-MB-231 tumours and\ndifferentiate the

25 µmol kg−1 of ZD2 peptide signiﬁcantly\nreduced the signal enhancement in MDA-MB-231 tumours due to\ncompetitive binding to the target  Quantitative analysis revealed that\nZD2-Gd3N@C80 produced 39 to 45% increase of contrast-to-noise\nratio  CNR  in the MDA-MB-231 tumours  Fig  4b  The smaller\nsize of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 facilitates rapid tumour extravasation \ntarget binding  and clearance from circulation  and enables\nrapid sensitive detection of aggressive TNBC with high CNR \nNo signiﬁcant difference was observed in signal enhancement in\nthe normal tissues before and after contrast injection in all\nthe tested groups  except for the excretory organs  kidneys\nand bladder  Supplementary Fig  3  Increased signal intensity in\nthe bladder indicates the excretion of unbound ZD2-Gd3N@C80\nvia renal ﬁltration \nThe systemic retention of both ZD2-Gd3N@C80 and hydro-\n\nxylated Gd3N@C80 was determined at 1 week post-injection using\nICP-OES  The amount of Gd III  in the body was near the detec-\ntion limit of the ICP-OES  Both the agents had <0 5% of the\ninjected dose remaining in the tissues and organs at 1 week post-\ninjection  Fig  4c  The potential release of the free Gd III  ions was\nalso tested by in vitro transmetallation assay with human serum  No\ntransmetallation of ZD2-Gd3N@C80  <0 12%  was observed\n Supplementary Fig  4  Studies show that fullerene cages are highly\nstable and the metal ions are stably enclosed in these cages18  30 \nMetallofullerene cages have been reported to even withstand\nexposure to β-radiation18  The residual endogenous metal ions seen\nin our study could be the result of the weak complexation of the\npeptide with the endogenous metal ions  Consistent with previous\nreports19  32  the entrapment of the toxic Gd III  ions in the full-\nerene cage prevents their systemic release and tissue interaction \nwhich is critical for the safety of the Gd III -based contrast agents\nin consideration of clinical translation  These results suggest that\nZD2-Gd3N@C80 has the potential to overcome the reported toxic\nside effects of the existing GBCAs  caused by the release and\nretention of free Gd III  ions in the body \nThe potential of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 for differentiating breast\n\ncancer aggressiveness was further assessed in mice bearing ZR-75-1 \nHs578T  T47D and BT549 breast cancer xenografts  The ER-posi-\ntive ZR-75-1 and T47D xenografts showed a very slow rate of\ngrowth and relatively smaller tumour sizes as compared with the\nHs578T and BT549 TNBC tumours  At 7 T  injection of 20 µmol\nGd/kg ZD2-Gd3N@C80 produced greater signal enhancement and\nsigniﬁcantly higher CNR increase in the fast-growing Hs578T and\n\nBT549 tumours than in the slow-growing ZR-75-1 and T47D\ntumours  Fig  5  These results demonstrate that ZD2-Gd3N@C80\nis an effective high-relaxivity-targeted contrast agent that can\nimprove the sensitivity of molecular MRI for the detection and\ncharacterisation of aggressive breast tumours \nThis study has demonstrated that the peptide-targeted gado-\n\nfullerene with superior relaxivities can signiﬁcantly improve the\nsensitivity of molecular MRI in detection and characterisation of\naggressive breast cancer  We have shown that the superior relax-\nivity of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 markedly improved the sensitivity of MR\nimaging of the oncoprotein EDB-FN in aggressive breast cancer \nMRI with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 produces robust signal enhancement\nin aggressive MDA-MB-231 TNBC tumours at a much lower dose\n 1 67 µmol kg−1  at 1 Tesla  a sensitivity comparable with that of\nﬂuorescence imaging of ZD2-Cy5 5  0 5 µmol kg−1  in Fig  3  The\ntargeted contrast agent also produced strong enhancement in two\nother TNBC tumour models  not in slow-growing low-risk\ntumours at a high-ﬁeld strength  7 Tesla  and reduced dose  These\nresults have demonstrated the ability of the novel-targeted con-\ntrast agent for differentiating the fast-growing aggressive TNBC\ntumours from the slow-growing  non-metastatic and ER-positive\nbreast cancers  Our work pioneers effective non-invasive differ-\nentiation between breast tumours of different aggressiveness using\ncontrast enhanced MRI  EDB-FN is also highly expressed in other\ntypes of aggressive tumours  including prostate cancer24  head and\nneck cancer33 and ovarian cancer34  Therefore  molecular MRI\nwith ZD2-Gd3N@C80 can potentially be used for accurate\ndetection and characterisation of a broad spectrum of aggressive\ncancers with high sensitivity and superior resolution  The low\ndose  rapid renal clearance and absence of potential release of free\nGd III  ions of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 are advantageous safety features\nfor improving the safety proﬁle of GBCAs in clinical use  Clinical\ntranslation of molecular MRI with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 has the\npotential to overcome the limitations of current imaging tech-\nnologies and to signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of early\ndetection and characterisation of high-risk breast cancer for pre-\ncision healthcare of cancer patients \n\nMethods\nMaterials  Succinic anhydride and o-dichlorobenzene were purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich  St  Louis  MO  USA

yellow skin  and breath shortness [1] There are several\n\nrisk factors for BC  such as lack of exercise  obesity  alcohol use \nionizing radiation early menarche  later pregnancy or infertility \nolder age  being female  and family history [2] BC is responsible\nfor 25% of all tumors in women and is the most common type of\nfemale cancer [3] BC is more common in women in developed\ncountries  which leads to 522 000 death cases in 2012 [4 5]\n\nEstrogen receptor  ER  human epidermal growth factor receptor\n2  HER2  and progesterone receptor  PR  are the 3 important\nreceptors of BC cells  and HER2+ BCs are usually more\naggressive than HER2  BCs [6 7] It has been reported that\nHER2 or its product is approximately overexpreesed in 25%\nto 30% BCs  and HER2 overexpression has correlation with\nelevated recurrence and poor prognosis in BC [8]\n\nBC patients are usually treated by surgery  or surgery\ncombined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [9] Additional\nregional radiotherapy to the medial supraclavicular lymph nodes\nand internal mammary can signiﬁcantly increase distant\nmetastasis-free survival  DMFS  disease-free survival  DFS \nand overall survival of BC patients in stage I to III [10]\n\nLocoregional recurrence and distant metastases might be limited\nby postmastectomy radiotherapy [11] and intraoperative radio-\ntherapy with electrons has potential values in early BC treated\n\neast-conserving surgery [12] Whole-brain radiotherapy\nT  followed by systemic therapy can be used to improve\n\nthe survival of BC patients with the HER2  luminal A

Although various treatments for breast cancer related lymphedema exist  there is still a need for a\nmore effective and convenient approach  Pilot studies and our clinical observations suggested that acupuncture\nmay be a potential option  This study aims to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture on BCRL and evaluate its\nsafety using a rigorously designed trial \n\nMethods/Design  Women who are clinically diagnosed as unilateral BCRL  with a 10% to 40% increase in volume\ncompared to the unaffected arm  will be recruited  Following baseline assessment  participants will be randomized\nto either the real acupuncture group or sham-acupuncture group at a ratio of 1 1  and given a standard real\nacupuncture or sham-acupuncture treatment accordingly on both arms followed by the same usual care of\ndecongestive therapy  Volume measurements of both arms will be performed for every participant after each\ntreatment  Data collected at baseline and the last session will be used to calculate the primary outcome and\nsecondary outcomes  Other data will be exploited for interim analyses and trial monitoring  The primary outcome is\nthe absolute reduced limb volume ratio  Secondary outcomes are incidence of adverse events and change in\nquality of life  A t test or non-parameter test will be used to compare the difference between two groups  and\nassess the overall effectiveness of acupuncture using the SPSS software  version 12 \n\nDiscussion  This study will help expand our knowledge about the effectiveness of acupuncture on BCRL  and how\nacupuncture might be used in the management of this condition  Acupuncture may be a promising complement\nor alternative to conventional lymphedema treatment methods  if its effectiveness is confirmed \n\nTrial registration

the disrup-\ntion of lymph flow  breast cancer related lymphedema\n BCRL  is a distressing problem afflicting around 20% of\nwomen who underwent breast cancer treatment  and is\ncharacterized by the chronic swelling of one or both\nupper extremities [1–4]  Depending on the extent of the\nsurgery and auxiliary treatments  BCRL affects patients\ndifferently  and may develop one or several years later\nafter surgery [5]  With the increase in breast-cancer inci-\ndence as well as the five-year survival rate  it is estimated\nthat there are approximately 530 000 patients facing\nBCRL in China only [6]  Since patients under this condi-\ntion often require lifetime management [7]  it imposes a\nbig burden on the society with long-term costs  and\nmakes up a significant source of hardship for many\nfamilies due to health-related productivity loss [8  9] \nAccording to research  common risk factors for BCRL\nincludes obesity  axillary lymph node dissection  postop-\nerative radiotherapy  infection  and history of lymphan-\ngitis [10  11]  Moreover  there is no cure for BRCL so far \nand the only way is to avoid risk factors  reduce the\nseverity of symptoms and improve the function of the\naffected arm  As a result  almost every patient experien-\ncing breast cancer surgery is advised to take precautions\nand take good care of the affected arm to prevent\nlymphedema [12  13]  All these things pose a reminder\nto patients of their malignant status and become a\nprominent psychosocial problem that afflicts breast can-\ncer survivors [14  15]  As a result  the quality of life is\nmuch lower for patients after breast cancer surgery than\nthose without this condition [16–19]  At present  there\nare various treatment options to deal with BCRL  includ-\ning lymph drainage  low-level laser  micro-surgery  and\ntransplantation of axillary lymph nodes [20–24]  How-\never  no consensus has been reached on any specific\napproach for BCRL [25]  and the management of BCRL\nremains a major challenge for both physicians and\npatients [26] \nIn the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine  TCM \n\ndiseases like BCRL are considered as the same “zheng”\nas “edema” [27]  and is thought to be caused by qi defi-\nciency and blood stagnation  Acupuncture  as an ancient\ntherapy in TCM  is thought to have the efficacy to\nstimulate the transformation of qi and drainage of\ndampness [28]  and is widely used for various diseases\nincluding edema in East Asia for thousands of years\n[29]  Previous researches in patients with lymphedema\nsuggest that this treatment might reduce swelling by\nimproving circulation without inducing safety issues\n[30–35]  However  results regarding its effectiveness in\nthe reduction of swelling have not yet been well estab-\nlished  and no randomized controlled trial has been per-\nformed on this issue  Therefore  with this protocol  we\n\naim to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for the\ntreatment of BCRL \n\nMethod\nStudy setting/design\nThis multi-center two-arm randomized clinical trial will\nbe performed in the following three medical centers  the\nFourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University\n about 400 breast cancer patients seen annually  the\nThird Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of\nChinese Medicine  about 200 breast cancer patients seen\nannually  and Liuzhou Maternity and Child Health Care\nHospital  about 120 breast cancer patients seen annu-\nally  A fixed quota  number of participants recruited \nwill be distributed to each center based on their total\nnumber of breast cancer patients yearly  Additional file 1 \nThe recruitment would start from December  2016  and\nwill end in October  2019 synchronously in the three\ncenters  For patients assigned to the real acupuncture\ngroup  a standard acupuncture procedure using the real\nwill be performed  for patients assigned to the sham\nacupuncture group  a standard acupuncture procedure\nusing the sham needles will be performed  The acu-\npoints  frequency  3 times a week for 4 weeks  and\nduration  30 min after de qi  of each patient in both\ngroups should be the same  All participants in both\ngroups will receive the same usual care of decongestive\ntherapy following acupuncture  An overview of the\nenrollment procedures  the study design  and the assess-\nments of this trial is illustrated in Table 1 \nThis study has been approved by the Institutional Re-\n\nview Board of the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi\nMedical University  Approval Number  PJK2016090 \n\nStudy oversight\nThree committees will be in charge of the supervision in\nthis trial \n\n1  The trial steering committee  TSC \n\nThe TSC  composed of trial designers of the trial and\ncoordinators of each center  is responsible for key tech-\nnical and operational problems  such as changes in eligi-\nbility criteria  outcomes  analyses  etc  A meeting will be\nheld every month \n\n2  The trial coordinating committee  TCC \n\nThe TCC  composed of coordinators  acupuncturists\nand nurses in each center  is in charge of specific busi-\nness  such as recruitment and identification of possible\nparticipants  information dissemination of this trial  col-\nlection and preservation of data and reports  and man-\nagement of trial sites  The coordinators in each center\n\nZhu et al  BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine   2017  17 467 Page 2 of 9\n\n\n\nare responsible for the establishment of the standard op-\neration procedures and the training of relevant staff\nprior to the initiation of this trial  The TCC will cooper-\nate with TSC and make a report every month \n\n3  The data and safety monitoring board  DSMB \n\nThe DSMB  composed of experienced experts in ex-\nperimental design and statistics  is responsible for review\nand evaluation of the trial periodically  They mainly\nfocus on issues such as execution of the trial  collection\nof the data  participants’ safety  and personal privacy\nprotection  They will also report to the TSC monthly\nand may provide advice in the modification or termin-\nation of the trial \n\nEligibility criteria\nIn this trial  following inclusion criteria will be adopted \n\n▪ women who have completed breast cancer treatment\nfor more than 1 year \n▪ no evidence of recurrence \n▪

exclusion criteria \nThen possible participants will be invited to attend a\nscreening visit  during which a routine physical examin-\nation and a baseline assessment including the upper\nlimbs and risks of recurrence will be performed  The co-\nordinators in charge will confirm their eligibility based\non their health status and inclusion criteria  For every\neligible participant  a unique number will be given by\nthe coordinators based on their enrollment sequence\nafter a written informed consent was obtained  and data\non demographic information will be collected through\ninterviews and questionnaires by the acupuncturists\nfunded by this project \n\nRandomization and allocation\nEligible participants in each center are randomized into\nthe real acupuncture group and the sham-acupuncture\ngroup at a ratio of 1 1 according to the randomization\nsequence  which is a series of randomization numbers\nrepresenting each patient’s unique number  and pre-\ngenerated by the chief designer using RAND function in\nMicrosoft Excel program according to the quota of each\ncenter  Additional file 1 \n\nBlinding\nIn this trial  participants and statisticians are blinded to the\ngroup assignment  whereas acupuncturists are not  due to\nthe nature of this trial  However  to minimize the uninten-\ntional physical cues and bias in this trial  acupuncturists will\nbe required to emulate the same procedure for the sham-\nacupuncture groups  And the credibility of blinding will be\nassessed by experiments before the formal trial  and adjust-\nments will be made until it is acceptable  The process of\nthe blinding will be monitored and assessed by the DSMB \n\nIntervention\nEligible participants will be required to set up an appoint-\nment by the acupuncturist according to their symptoms\npatterns  such as the time period their lymphedema mani-\nfest the most typical symptoms  Upon arrival at scheduled\nappointments  participants will receive real or sham acu-\npuncture accordingly on both arms  In this trial  we apply\nsterilized stainless steel needles  0 25 × 40 mm  Asia Med \nMunich  Germany  in real acupuncture group  and blunt\ntelescopic placebo needles  Streitberger needle  Asia Med \nMunich  Germany  in sham-controlled group  All proce-\ndures will be performed by officially registered acupunc-\nturists with clinical experience of 3 years at least \n\nReal acupuncture group\nPatients in the real acupuncture group will receive true\nacupuncture 3 times a week for 4 weeks  12 sessions  at\n\n6 acupoints in each arm  Jianyu  LI 15  Jianliao  SJ 14 \nBinao  LI 14  Quchi  LI 11  Shousanli  LI 10  and\nWaiguan  SJ 5  These acupuncture points were selected\non the basis of classic TCM record  the published litera-\nture [30–35]  and the consensus between our experi-\nenced acupuncturists  Acupoints are detailed in Fig  1 \nAfter the application of alcohol swabs  these acupoints\nwill be covered by adhesive plaster with plastic rings \nand stimulated by manual rotation of the needles ac-\ncompanied by lifting and thrusting gently to make pa-\ntients get de qi  which is a sensation of aching or\ndistension or numbness elicited by acupoint stimulation\n[36  37]  Then needles will stay put for 30 min \n\nSham-acupuncture group\nPatients in the sham-acupuncture group will receive the\nsame sessions of treatment using Streitberger needles at\nthe same acupoints  Streitberger needles have the appear-\nance of the real needles  however  they will not penetrate\nthe skin  They can be placed at the same acupoints as the\nreal acupuncture group  and held in position by adhesive\nplaster with a plastic ring  which is conducive to the blind-\ning purpose [38]  When the needle is pushed against the\nskin  a pricking sensation just like the real insertion will be\ngenerated  However  as the pressure increases  the needle\nshaft will bounce back into the handle  which guarantees\nthe skin unbroken and makes an artificial impression of\nneedle insertion  Fig  2  Other procedures will be the\nsame with the real acupuncture group  including the ap-\nplication of adhesive plaster and plastic rings \n\nFig  1 Overview of selected acupoints in this trial  Participants will\nreceive real acupuncture or sham-acupuncture at the same acupoints\nin both arms 3 times a week for 4 weeks  12 sessions \n\nZhu et al  BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine   2017  17 467 Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\nDecongestive therapy\nFor ethical considerations  the interest of participants in\nsham-group  every participant in both groups will receive\nthe same usual care of decongestive therapy after treatment \nwhich includes a daily manual lymph drainage  gentle exer-\ncise  applying moisturizer  and wearing elastic compression\ngarments  Table 2 details the duration  frequency  executor \nand location of each step  For participants who take other\npractice  detailed reports will be required \n\nPatient health monitoring\nFor each participant in both groups  blood pressure and\npulse rate will be monitored following every treatment\nsession  whereas routine blood test  ECG test  renal\nfunction test and liver function test will be conducted\nevery 2 weeks  Table 1  These data will be monitored\nclosely by DSMB during the trial \nMoreover  as cuts and other breakage of the skin\n\nwould incur infection and the deterioration of lymph-\nedema  all participants will be warned  For those devel-\noping sudden onset of infection  the treatment should be\ndiscontinued till the patients have fully recovered and\nthe coordinator in charge should be contacted as soon\nas possible  In other cases like serious complications and\noccurrence of other emergencies  where patients are un-\nfit for further therapies  they will be persuaded to quit \n\nData collection\nBefore the first treatment session  every participant will\nget an assessment of both limbs by perometer  which is\nan automated infrared light digital scanner equipped\nwith a microcomputer  When the limb is placed inside \nthe infrared light transmitters located on two sides of\n\nthe perometer will be activated  and the blockage of the\ntransmission of infrared light from both sides caused by\nthe limb will be recorded and calculated  As the trans-\nmitters move along the limb  a series of images will be\nrecorded  Hence a highly accurate measurement of the\nlimb size and volume will be created  And these results\nwill serve as the baseline data  Following the treatment\nof each session  participants in both groups will be asked\nto take assessments to get the interim data  Upon the last\nsession  the assessments of both limbs will be adopted as\nthe end-point data  For each arm  the measurement will\nrepeat 3 times to ensure the reliability  Table 1 illustrates\nall the time points when measurements are taken during\nthe whole procedure \n\nPrimary outcome\nAbsolute reduced limb volume ratio  ARLVR \nThe ARLVR is the proportion of absolute reduced limb\nvolume in the affected arm after the therapy  compared\nwith the absolute excess volume in the affected arm be-\nfore the therapy  This index is inspired by the methods\nestablished by Anderson et al  [39] With all data col-\nlected at the end of the trial  the ARLVR will be calcu-\nlated using the following formula \n\nARLVR %ð Þ ¼ VAB‐VALð Þ‐ VUB‐VULð Þ\nVAB‐VALð Þ   100%\n\nIn particular  VAB represents the volume of affected\narm with lymphedema at baseline  VAL represents the\nvolume of affected arm with lymphedema at the last ses-\nsion  VUB represents the volume of unaffected arm at\n\nFig  2 Structure of Streitberger needle   1  Needle handle  2  Needle rod  3  Blunt tip of the placebo needle  4

Possible ad-\nverse events include infection and exacerbation of\nlymphedema  Participants will be asked to report any\nsignificant changes to their health state following treat-\nment  Once adverse event occurs  it should be closely\nmonitored and meticulously recorded until stabilization\nor resolution  and the chief designer and the coordina-\ntors in charge will be informed immediately  Together\nwith the acupuncturist in charge  they will consult on\nthe case  take proper actions and evaluate the severity \nUnless it has been confirmed irrelevant with the inter-\nvention of this trial  every possible case should be re-\nported timely to the Institutional Review Board  The\nchief designer is responsible for the report of all adverse\nevents  The DSMB will inspect periodically to ensure\nthat all adverse events are handled properly \n\nQuality of life\nQuality of life is assessed using a questionnaire from Pa-\ntient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Sys-\ntem  PROMIS  http //www healthmeasures net/index php \nwhich requires participants to evaluate their overall health\nthrough 10 self-reported global health items representing\nphysical health  pain  fatigue  mental health and social\nhealth  Global Physical Health  GPH  and Global Mental\nHealth  GMH  scales will be computed accordingly  and\nhigher scores reflect better life quality  This scoring system\nhas demonstrated remarkable internal consistency and reli-\nability [40] \n\nSample size calculation\nAs no two-arm  randomized  multi-centered  sham-\ncontrolled trial has been performed on this topic  no exist-\ning data regarding the sample size are available  However \nbased on our preliminary clinical data collected and a\nsimilar study [41]  we assume that the mean and SD of\nARLVR in the real-acupuncture group and sham-\nacupuncture group are  0 32  0 25  and  0 22  0 2  respect-\nively  and after calculation using G-Power  V 3 1  the ef-\nfect size  ES  is 0 4417261  Next we input the parameters\nabove  set the alpha risk  α  type 1 error risk  and beta risk\n β  type II error risk  at 0 05 and 0 2 respectively  and\nchoose “t test from two independent groups” and “A\nPriori  Compute required sample size given α  power and\neffect size”  then after calculating  the required sample size\nis 164  Additional file 2  Assuming the loss to follow-up\nrate is 20%  then 197 is the total minimum sample size re-\nquired in this trial  However  to increase the power and\n\nmake full preparation  we decided to recruit 200 partici-\npants  100 for each arm in this trial \n\nLoss to follow-up and data management\nIn practice  however  participants might withdraw from\nthe treatment program at any time  In that case  a call\nfrom the acupuncturist in charge will be given to the\nparticipant  and appropriate advice and assistance will be\nprovided  If a participant insists on withdrawing from\nthis trial  an instant evaluation of lymphedema status\nwill be made  if it is possible  Complete case reports and\ncase reports on loss-to-follow-up of the participants will\nbe reported to the coordinators in charge every month \nFirst-hand data will be recorded by the nurse and the\nacupuncturist  The coordinator in each center will col-\nlect and preserve the data every two weeks  When the\ntrial is done  the aggregated data will be extracted by\ntwo independent researchers to guarantee the accuracy \nand finally submitted to the principal investigator for\nanalysis  During the whole process  the privacy of re-\nsearch participants will be fully protected \n\nStatistical and data analysis\nUpon the receipt of the final data  the Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test  K-S test  will be performed  followed by a\ntest for homogeneity of variance to see whether the vari-\nances are equal between groups  If the data distribution\nfits a normal distribution with equal variance  the inde-\npendent t test will be employed  otherwise  nonparametric\ntest will be chosen to determine whether there is signifi-\ncant difference between the real acupuncture group and\nthe sham acupuncture group  Moreover  one-way ANOVA\nwill be performed to see whether there is significant differ-\nence between three centers  Analysis of covariance ad-\njusted for clinical center and baseline will be applied on\nthe condition that significant difference exists between\nthree centers  In addition  regression analysis will be per-\nformed to analyze the effects of co-variances  risk factors \nsuch as BMI  axillary lymph node dissection  postoperative\nradiotherapy  infection  and history of lymphangitis on the\noverall outcome of this treatment  A type I level\nerror < 0 05 will be interpreted as statistically

The ITT analysis will collect data from all the partici-\npants in this trial  and for those loss to follow-up  the last\nobservation carried forward method will be implemented \nAs for the PP analysis  data collection will be rigorous \nand only those participants who strictly comply with the\nprotocol are eligible  The interim analysis in this trial per-\nformed by DSMB  will use the interim data collected dur-\ning the trial to actively monitor the operating status of the\n\nZhu et al  BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine   2017  17 467 Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n\ntrial and help

psychological morbidity to pa-\ntients [42]  Despite the wide application of less invasive\nsurgical techniques  risk for the development of BCRL\nstill remains [43]  Current treatments options for BCRL\nare either expensive or rather time consuming [44] \nTraditional acupuncture emerges as an efficacious  eco-\nnomical  and convenient choice to manage this chronic\ncondition with few side effects  according to several pilot\nreports [30–35] and our clinical observation  However \nafter a thorough search in Pubmed and Embase for rele-\nvant articles  we found existing studies on this issue were\ncase reports  small single-arm studies [30–33]  or paral-\nlel studies using regular routine management or Dios-\nmin as a comparison [34  35]  which cannot rule out the\nplacebo effect and needs to be confirmed by rigorously-\ndesigned  large-scale studies  The efficacy of real acu-\npuncture over sham acupuncture in dealing BCRL has\nnot been fully illustrated  Therefore  additional research\nis required to confirm the efficacy and cost-effectiveness\nof acupuncture on BCRL In this study  we will adopt\nStreitberger needle as the sham-acupuncture instrument \nCompared with other methods such as placebo points\nacupuncture  shallow acupuncture at real acupoints and\nshallow acupuncture at placebo points  Streitberger nee-\ndle have significant advantages  which make it a perfect\nchoice to keep consistency and credibility  and avoid\npossible efficacy brought by placebo point acupuncture\nor shallow acupuncture  This method has been used in\nseveral studies with good performance  and was recom-\nmended as a reliable sham control [45–47]  Another merit\nof this study is the measurement instrument we choose \nAs pointed out above  perometer can easily and swiftly\nmeasure the volume of a participants’ limb with high reli-\nability and minimal inter-operator variability compared\nwith other conventional methods  such as volumeters\n using a water displacement tank to measure volume  and\ntape measures  using a tape to measure limb circumfer-\nence  [48–50]  although the measurements from different\nmethods are not interchangeable [51]  According to the\ndata collected from patients and previous reports  the day\nto day variability in limb volumes is around 0 5 [52]  What\nis more  to better embody the real effect of acupuncture\non BCRL  we use the ARLVR  a more reasonable and\npractical index that is calculated based on the surplus be-\ntween the affected arm and the contralateral arm  Theor-\netically  it can exclude the interfering factors such as base\neffect and weight fluctuation \nHowever  there are some limitations in this study  First \n\nto maximally rule out the placebo effect and subjective\n\nbias  a standardized acupoint regimen is applied in this\ntrial  which is not in accordance with the concept of indi-\nvidualized therapy of CTM  And additional studies are\nneeded to determine the difference between the standard-\nized acupoint regimen and the individualized acupoint re-\ngime  Second  according to TCM  de qi  the needle\nsensation during acupuncture  is regarded as an important\nsign of successful acupuncture  and is essential for exert-\ning the clinical efficacy of acupuncture  However  for\nblinding purpose  acupuncturist are forbidden to enquire\nabout it in both groups in this trial  Finally  as acupunc-\nture is common approach in dealing various symptoms in\nChina  chances are good that some participants in the\nsham-acupuncture group may feel the difference  Double\nblindness is not applied in this study  given that the pro-\ncedure is conducted by the acupuncturists \nIn conclusion  this article presents a rigorously de-\n\nsigned trial to verify the efficacy of acupuncture on\nBCRL  The results of this trial will provide more infor-\nmation on this issue \n\nAdditional file\n\nAdditional file 1  Block Randomized Sequence   PDF 83 kb

radiation source\ninside catheters implanted into a female breast is determined via electromagnetic tracking\n EMT  Dwell positions and dwell times of the radiation source are established  relative to\nthe patient’s anatomy  from an initial X-ray-CT-image  During the irradiation treatment  cath-\neter displacements can occur due to patient movements  The current study develops an\nautomatic analysis tool of EMT data sets recorded with a solenoid sensor to assure concor-\ndance of the source movement with the treatment plan  The tool combines machine learning\ntechniques such as multi-dimensional scaling  MDS  ensemble empirical mode decomposi-\ntion  EEMD  singular spectrum analysis  SSA  and particle filter  PF  to precisely detect\nand quantify any mismatch between the treatment plan and actual EMT measurements  We\ndemonstrate that movement artifacts as well as technical signal distortions can be removed\nautomatically and reliably  resulting in artifact-free reconstructed signals  This is a prerequi-\nsite for a highly accurate determination of any deviations of dwell positions from the treat-\nment plan \n\nIntroduction\nHigh dose rate brachytherapy  HDR-BT  recently became an alternative to whole breast irradi-\n\nation of tumors in female breasts during radiation therapy [1  2]  Thereby roughly 14 − 25\ncatheters are inserted into the female breast by a surgical intervention [3]  During radiation\n\ntreatment  then a radioactive source  192Ir for example  is moved inside the catheters following\na treatment plan [4  5] which fixes dwell positions and dwell times  The latter are designed to\n\nassure an optimal and intense irradiation of the tumor bed while  at the same time  keeping\n\nside effects  i  e  irradiating healthy tissue  at a minimum  This strategy follows from the obser-\n\nvation that tumor recurrences most frequently happen at the tumor bed  HDR brachytherapy\n\ncommonly utilizes a remote afterloader unit to deliver high activity 192Ir radioactive source \nradiating 380 [keV] γ-photons directly into the tumor treatment volume  Application of such\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608

[Gy]  affords ensuring accurate radiation dose delivery in accord\nwith the treatment plan  Such high positioning accuracy requires keeping the catheters in the\n\nsame position during all subsequent fractions  so as to precisely deliver the planned radiation\n\ndose  Given these constraints  it is mandatory to assure the highest precision in source posi-\n\ntioning according to the treatment plan  The latter is deduced from X-ray computed tomogra-\n\nphy  CT  images which are taken after the cancerous tissue has been removed by a surgical\n\nintervention  Lumpectomy  Quality assurance thus affords that the exact spatial localization\n\nof the radiation source relative to the anatomy of the patient  and its concordance with the\n\ntreatment plan  needs to be determined before the treatment starts \n\nImplant geometry  hence indirectly radiation source localization  can be determined with\n\nan electromagnetic tracking  EMT  device  Thereby a field generator  FG  produces a mag-\n\nnetic field extending across the female breast  The EMT system used in this study applies a\n\nthree-pole transmitter to generate an electromagnetic field  Inside the catheters then a five\n\ndegrees of freedom  5DoF  solenoid sensor is moved in accord with a pre-defined treatment\n\nplan  The sensor induces a distance—dependent induction voltage which allows to determine\n\nits spatial position  dwell position  and mean residence time  dwell time \n\nThe precision of the EMT system itself  and the accuracy of the registration between the\n\nfield generator  FG   EMT data set  and the CT imaging  Digital Imaging and COmunications\n\nin Medicine  DICOM  data set  coordinate systems  have a strong impact on the performance\n\nof an EMT system in HDR-BT catheter reconstruction  Performance assessments of EMT sys-\n\ntems are mostly done with ideal  undistorted laboratory settings intended to mimic a clinical\n\nBT treatment environment  Corresponding data from a clinical environment are almost non-\n\nexistent  Recent reviews by [6  1  2] discuss quality assurance aspects  catheter reconstruction\n\naccuracy and catheter technology in HDR-BT  Especially [1] reports a typical accuracy of\n\n0 9 ± 0 2 [mm] which could be obtained for dynamic tracking in HDR-BT when using an opti-\nmal  distortionless  i  e  phantom-based  configuration and a pulsed DC EMT system  With an\n\nAC EMT system  ideally an accuracy of 0 26 ± 0 16 [mm] was achieved [7]  The error increased\nto more than 2 [mm] when magnetic field distorting equipment  a 20 inch Liquid Crystal Dis-\nplay  LCD  monitor  was approaching 30 [cm] of the center of the magnetic field generator\n FG  A recent study by [8] used EMT  in combination with a rigid coherent point drift  CPD \n\nalgorithm [9]  to estimate relative positions of a five Degrees-of-Freedom  5DoF —sensor\n\nwhich was manually inserted into the catheters  Additionally  in combination with fiducial\n\n6DoF—sensors placed onto the surface of the breast  the influence of the breathing motion has\n\nbeen compensated  However  objections concerning the reliability of such corrections within a\n\nlong term treatment have been raised in [2]  Nevertheless  the authors claim an achieved aver-\n\nage deviation of 1 3 [mm] on the registered implant geometry on the CT—couch  The corre-\nsponding accuracy of the EMT—based dwell position determination resulted in a mean\n\ndeviation of 2 4 [mm] relative to the treatment plan  A further recent report using EMT for\ncatheter reconstruction in HDR-BT achieved 0 7 [mm] in positioning and 0 2deg in orienta-\ntion [5]  This study also avoided external registration by using an iterative closest point algo-\n\nrithm employing a finite difference method to compare reconstruction results from both\n\nconventional CT and EMT \n\nData from an EMT system is based on the coordinates of the field generator  i  e  on CFG \nThis data has to be transformed to the treatment planning coordinate system CTPS  Note that\nin general this transformation is highly anisotropic  A rigid-body  point-based registration is\n\noften conducted based on three or more fiducial points with positions known in both coordi-\n\nnate systems through optical measurements [10]  [11]  Thus the system yields the coordinates\n\nof the fiducial points which are either exported from the treatment planning system or are\n\nreceived as electromagnetic FG coordinates  This combination of EMT and imaging system\n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of

reconstruction much\n\nlarger than corresponding intrinsic EMT tracking errors [1]  By registering EMT and CT\n\ndwell positions  the residual mean error per catheter was found to be 0 6 ± 0 2 [mm]  with a\nmaximum catheter error of 0 9 ± 0 4 [mm] and a maximal dwell position error of 1 3 ± 0 7\n[mm]  Also catheter swaps and catheter tip shifts could be detected with high sensitivity and\nspecificity [12]  Field distortions based on nearby metal parts can only be corrected by calibra-\n\ntion procedures which imply a fixed environment and preparatory measurements [13]  Again \n\nerror measures are based on a phantom study  while real clinical applications are very scarce\n\n[14]  Commonly the radiation treatment encompasses several sessions which extend over a\n\nwhole week  roughly  Between the sessions  the patients move around which caries the risk for\n\nany spatial displacement of the catheters away from their positions deduced from the CT—\n\nimage and prescribed in the treatment plan  To quantify such displacements only from EMT\n\nmeasurements  we recently [15] proposed a method based on multi-dimensional scaling\n\n MDS  techniques [16]  [17]  [18] \n\nAn additional complication arises as patients are breathing during the EMT measurement \n\nand if they are also speaking  the resulting breathing signal can become highly complex and\n\nerratic  To aid removing such motion artifacts from the EMT recordings  in this proof-of-prin-\n\nciple study additional fiducial sensors are fixed on the chest of the patient  Their spatial posi-\n\ntions are also determined via an EMT measurement  Last but not least  occasional device\n\nmalfunctions add further artifact signals to the EMT recordings  In a recent study [19] we pro-\n\nposed a new way to get rid of such movement artifacts suggesting to employ an ensemble\n\nempirical mode decomposition  EEMD  of both the fiducial sensor and solenoid sensor signals\n\ncombined with particle filtering techniques  Particle filters [20]  [21] represent sequential\n\nMonte Carlo techniques and are well known from applications to system identification prob-\n\nlems  They are employed here to precisely track the trajectory of the solenoid sensor inside the\n\ncatheters without any noise contributions  The measured spatial dwell positions inside the\n\ncatheters provide source trajectories which  ideally  should be in perfect agreement with the\n\ntreatment plan  However  patient movements between the treatment sessions and breathing\n\nmotions during the EMT measurements cause signal distortions which result in deviations\n\nfrom the dwell positions defined in the treatment plan  As we will show  such deviations can\n\nbe precisely quantified after the measured EMT signals have been tracked with a particle filter\n\nand superimposed breathing mode artifacts have been removed with the help of an EEMD\n\nanalysis \n\nSystem identification techniques have hardly been applied to HDR-BT data since  A recent\n\nstudy [22] considered sensor tracking with an extended Kalman filter  It was mainly devoted\n\nto achieve a dynamic field distortion compensation within an EMT measurement  The authors\n\nused additional redundant sensors and a realistic state evolution model  They applied the\n\nSLAM algorithm [23]  [24] and combined it with an extended Kalman filter to be used in pre-\n\ncalibration procedures for system identification \n\nThe currently proposed protocol combines particle filter tracking methods with multi-\n\ndimensional scaling thus enabling the exclusive use of intrinsic EMT measurements of spatial\n\npositions of the solenoid sensors for catheter reconstruction  In addition  it relies on empirical\n\nmode decomposition techniques to decompose the recorded non-stationary time series and\n\nremove breathing artifacts in real clinical applications with patients  The newly proposed\n\nmethod robustly and almost perfectly reconstructs the shape of various catheters involved in\n\nany HDR-BT treatment  quantifies any deviations from the treatment plan and conveniently\n\nvisualizes the dwell position tracks of both  the CT data set and the various EMT data sets \n\nThe manuscript is organized as follows  Section 1 provides an

to serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed automatized data\n\nprocessing chain  Hence it relies on data that was collected in a recent study from four female\n\npatients with an age of 49 − 68 years  All women have been thoroughly informed and have\ngiven their written consent to the treatment which  furthermore  has been approved by the\n\ninstitutional review board of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nu¨rnberg\n\n Nr  355 − 14B  2014  The study comprised 4 patients between 49 − 68 years of age  The\nwomen underwent a high dose rate brachytherapy treatment of a breast cancer that was\n\nexcised in a surgical intervention  Lumpectomy  before the radiation treatment  For the\n\nHDR-Brachytherapy radiation treatment  catheters were implanted in the breast of the patients\n\nfollowing a pre-defined geometry designed by a experienced radiologist  The number of cathe-\n\nters varied from case to case with a mean number of implanted catheters of 18 25  Based on an\n\ninitial X-ray computed tomography  CT  a treatment plan was created with an Oncentra pro-\n\ngram  Oncentra1 Brachy v4 3  Elekta  Veenendaal  The Netherlands  which stores all data in\n\nthe Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine  DICOM  format  The contours for the\n\ntreatment plan were defined by a medical expert according to a prescription given in [25]  For\n\neach catheter  a different number of dwell positions was defined in the treatment plan  The\n\nmean number of dwell-positions per patient was 633 5  Altogether  for each patient  only the\n\nfirst session of EMT data collection was recorded on the CT bench  This imaging data was\n\nused for treatment planning and formed the reference data set to which all EMT-based data\n\nsets had to be compared  All subsequent EMT measurements then have been performed in an\n\nHDR Brachytherapy treatment room on a specifically prepared patient bench \n\nImage acquisition and treatment planning\nComputed tomography X-ray images  CT image  have been acquired either with breathing\n\ncommand  where an X-ray image is recorded while patients stopped breathing  For the treat-\n\nment plan  the catheters were reconstructed from CT image slices by a medical physicist \n\nHence  the reconstruction of the catheters depends on experience and attention of the medical\n\nphysicist  This data set is designated as CT data set \n\nThe catheters were implanted on the first day of the treatment period  Before the CT is\n\nacquired  the catheters are cut to a length of 287 5 [mm]  During treatment  the sensor is\ninserted into the catheter to its very end  From the very end of the catheter  a default margin of\n\nl0 = 5 [mm] is left  There the first dwell-position is set  and all subsequent dwell positions are\nchosen in steps of 2 5 [mm]  Not all these dwell positions are set active in the treatment plan \nhowever  Each dwell position is numbered as well as each catheter  From the EMT measure-\n\nments  the dwell-positions are calculated with the raw EMT data according to a method pro-\n\nposed in [26] \n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE |

by a Flexitron1  Electa AB  Stockholm  Sweden  afterloader with electromagnetic\ntracking capabilities and relied on a measurement software based on the rigid coherent point\n\ndrift  CPD  algorithm as detailed in [26]  The Flexitron system comprises a treatment delivery\n\nunit  TDU  treatment control panel  TCP  and a treatment communication console  TCC \n\nThe system control  SCU  field generator  FG  and the sensor interface units  SIU  jointly\n\nconstitute a prototype of an NDI Aurora1  Northern Digital Inc  Canada  EM tracking sys-\n\ntem  The measurement data is collected by a computer  The catheters are connected with the\n\nafterloader via transfer tubes of total length 1000 [mm]  The length inside each catheter for\nthe source applicator is 400 [mm]  The speed of the sensor can be varied between 2 5 [cm/s]\n− 50 [cm/s] [27]  The smallest step size between two dwell positions amounts to Δs = 1 [mm] \n\nFor an EMT measurement  a field generator  FG  is connected with a tracking system and\n\nplaced above the chest of the patient  During the automatic movement of the EM sensor along\n\nthe inside of the catheter within the field of view of the field generator  the spatial coordinates\n\nof the sensor can be derived via induction voltage signals generated in the solenoid sensors \n\nThe distance between FG and the sensor critically influences the signal sensitivity  Addition-\n\nally  three 6 DoF fiducial sensors are placed on the thorax of the patient to measure the breath-\n\ning motion  All data are made available at https //osf io/kd6ta  DOI  10 17605/OSF IO/KD6TA\n\nfor the convenience of the reader \n\nPhantom data  The catheters implanted into the phantom were connected to the afterloa-\n\nder via transfer cables  The treatment plan defined for the phantom was up-loaded to the soft-\n\nware of the Flexitron1 afterloader prototype  Electa AB  Stockholm  Sweden  The sensor was\n\nmoved to each dwell position inside the catheters according to the treatment plan and\n\nremained at the dwell positions for the defined dwell time \n\nTo investigate the possibility of a breathing compensation  preparative measurements with\n\na phantom have been performed  12 catheter tubes were implanted into a breast prosthesis by\n\na surgeon  see Fig 1  The template and needles from the radiation surgery were used for\n\nimplantation  The tubes were cut to a length of 287 5 [mm]  A computer tomography  CT  X-\nray image of the breast phantom was acquired  Also a treatment plan was created based on the\n\ncatheters’ shapes in the CT image  In a subsequent experiment  the breast phantom was care-\n\nfully fixed to the chest of a male test person  With this design  some very small catheter dis-\n\nplacements could arise from occasional spatial displacements of the prosthesis  However  they\n\nwere smaller than the precision of EMT measurement  The phantom was measured three\n\ntimes according to the following protocol  the person was either\n\n• breathing calmly in the chest  or\n\n• breathing calmly in the belly  or\n\n• breathing while speaking \n\nThe measured sensor movement then consisted of a superposition of the chest motion and\n\nthe sensor motion  Thereby  the chest motion was in a direction roughly perpendicular to the\n\nsensor motion inside the catheters \n\nPatient data  After the preparatory phantom measurements  data measured from four\n\npatients was analyzed  Depending on the location of the tumor  in each of the patients  the\n\ncatheters were implanted in different anatomical planes  A patient specific treatment plan was\n\ndefined for each of the four patients by an experienced medical physicist  For each of the\n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer

specifically\n\nprepared patient table  The movement of the solenoid sensor according to the treatment plan\n\nwas tracked with the NDI Aurora1  Northern Digital Inc  Canada  EM tracking system in\n\ncombination with the Flexitron1  Electa AB  Stockholm  Sweden  afterloader system  The\n\nmeasurements were performed in analogy with the phantom case  The first measurement took\n\nplace one day after the surgical implantation of the catheters  Though the field generator axes\n\nremained always the same  the implant plane influences the spatial direction of the highest\n\nbreathing

mode contribution strongly depends on the amplitude of the breast\n\nmovement during breathing and/or speaking  The women analyzed in this study differed in\n\nthe number of implanted  and finally

we describe a data analysis methodology to automatically analyze the electromag-\n\nnetic tracking  EMT  measurements obtained during a HDR-BT treatment  The induction\n\nvoltage signals are obtained from a solenoid sensor moving inside various catheters implanted\n\ninto the breast of female patients  and three fiducial sensors fixed to the chest of the patient \n\nrespectively  The movement of the 5 DoF solenoid sensor in the inhomogeneous magnetic\n\nfield of a field generator is characterized by the sensor’s dwell positions  An independent mea-\n\nsure of the breathing mode is obtained with EMT measurements of signals from the fiducial\n\nsensors \n\nSuch measurements contain a number of artifacts  mainly those from the breathing motion\n\nof the patients during the measurement  The proposed data processing chain encompasses the\nfollowing steps \n\n• Sensor tracking  A particle filter  PF  technique is employed to track the dwell positions of a\nsolenoid sensor inside various catheters implanted in a female breast for a radiotherapy\n\ntreatment \n\n• Artifact removal  Next  singular spectrum analysis  SSA  and ensemble empirical mode decom-\nposition  EEMD  are applied to remove artifacts from the recorded signals \n\n• Dwell position deviations  Finally  a multi-dimensional scaling technique is employed to quan-\ntitatively compare sensor dwell position measurements recorded with respect to different\n\ncoordinate systems \n\nGoal of the study  Up till now  all these signal pre-processing techniques are done interac-\n\ntively and need the intervention of the user  This is a tedious procedure  Hence the goal of the\n\npresent study is to automatize this data analysis and to establish a data analysis protocol with-\n\nout recourse to any external registration of the breathing motion by other methods than EMT \n\nStatic and dynamic experiments on a Phantom serve to establish the methodology and to\n\nprove the robustness and reliability of our data analysis methodology  Additionally a human\n\nmedical expert is asked to check all results and approve their correctness  Thus we want to pro-\n\nvide an objective and reliable data analysis tool to automatically  efficiently  precisely and reli-\n\nably evaluate EMT measurements recorded during a HDR-BT\n\nThe application of PF [19] and MDS [15] has been described recently  hence only a short\n\naccount will be provided here  The current study rather focuses on automatic artifact removal\n\ntechniques based on SSA and EEMD  We will show that a combination of both methods is\n\nable to remove noise and breathing mode contributions superimposed onto the EMT sensor\n\nsignals \n\nGenerally  the EMT sensor signal is ballasted with measurement noise  To estimate the true\n\nsensor state during the sensor’s motion inside a catheter  we recently proposed to employ a\n\nTable 1  Summary of all patient data and treatment plan variables for all measurements conducted in this study

system \n\nHowever  particle filtering cannot remove large amplitude artifacts occasionally observed\n\non bothe the solenoid sensor and the fiducial sensor signals  Here we suggest to apply SSA to\n\nremove such artifacts \n\nBecause patients breath during the EMT measurements  the recorded EMT signal is cor-\n\nrupted by the superimposed breathing mode contribution and eventually occurring additional\n\nmotions of the patients lying on the treatment table  In case  patients are speaking during the\n\nmeasurements  these breathing motions can become highly irregular  To automatically remove\n\nsuch breathing artifacts from the EMT solenoid sensor signals  we propose to decompose both\n\nthe fiducial and the solenoid sensor signals with an EEMD  identify those intrinsic modes\n\nwhich are dominated by the breathing modes  and reconstruct the sensor signal neglecting\n\nsuch contaminating modes \n\nThe automatic identification of intrinsic modes underlying the measured solenoid sensor\n\nsignal via a comparison with the intrinsic modes of the fiducial sensor signal is achieved with a\n\nproper similarity measure  Several such measures have been tested with rather similar results \n\nFinally  EMT dwell position measurements from subsequent treatment sessions of the sen-\n\nsor inside the catheters refer to different coordinate systems  Hence  results are not comparable\n\nstraighforwardly  Recently we proposed a multi-dimensional scaling scheme to rectify this\n\nmismatch  thus rendering different dwell position measurements quantitatively comparable \n\nThus an MDS is finally applied to the artifact-free dwell position tracks resulting from particle\n\nfiltering \n\nWe demonstrated the principle usefulness of this data analysis strategy which does not need\n\nany additional external registration  We also corroborated a robust and reliable identification\n\nof all sensor dwell positions  and their deviations from the treatment plan  during an EMT\n\nmeasurement to identify and characterize the shape  i  e  the spatial location and orientation \n\nof all implanted catheters used during the radiation treatment \n\nIn Fig 2  the structure of the data processing chain is illustrated in a flowchart  The goal of\n\nthis data analysis methodology is to obtain the shape of the catheters and the spatial\n\nFig 2  Flowchart of the algorithm

sensors are placed on the patient’s chest to measure the breathing signal  The\n\nsensor  inserted into the implanted catheters  instead measures a superposition of the breath-\n\ning motion and its movement along the catheter \n\nMeasurement protocol  Sensor tracking with sequential Monte Carlo techniques  In sys-\n\ntem identification problems  state space models with latent state variables are used to estimate\n\nunderlying dynamic systems states from noise-corrupted measurements  Bayesian state esti-\n\nmation is achieved by combining such observations with prior knowledge of the physical sys-\n\ntem to sequentially estimate the underlying unobservable system states in a statistically\n\noptimal way  Referring to EMT measurements in HDR-BT  the observations correspond to\n\nsensor dwell positions zðp rÞm   p ¼ 1          P  r ¼ 1         R measured at discrete times tm inside\ncatheter p during treatment session r  The latent states correspond to the underlying exact spa-\ntial positions xðp rÞm   given some physical model of the sensor motion  To simplify the treatment \nseveral Markovian approximations are generally applied neglecting any memory effects as well\n\nas cross-dependencies of the variables [21]  The underlying theory of particle filters is shortly\n\nsummarized in Appendix 1 \n\nArtifact removal with singular spectrum analysis  To achieve this goal  first of all  the noise\n\ncontribution to the fiducial signal and the measurement artifacts in the sensor signals due to\n\ntechnical malfunction have to be removed  Here we propose to employ Singular Spectrum\nAnalysis  SSA  [28]  [29] to achieve denoising and artifact removal [30]  [31] either from the\nfiducial or the sensor signals  For the convenience of the reader  a short account of SSA is pre-\n\nsented in Appendix 2 \n\n• Fiducial signal\n\nFirst of all  an average breathing signal was calculated by averaging over the three fiducial\n\nsignals  This signal was not tracked by a particle filter  Consequently  it was very noisy  To\n\nget rid of the noise on this signal  an SSA was applied to the latter  For further computations \n\nonly the first SSA component was considered [32]  In Fig 3  the original mean breathing sig-\n\nnal and the first component of an SSA decomposition is compared \n\nFig 3  The measured raw breathing signal is colored in black  and in grey the first component of the\nSSA is depickted \n\nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 g003\n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 September 21  2017 9 / 31\n\n\n\n\n\n• Outlier detection\n\nDespite a particle filter tracking of the sensor signal  the data still contained outliers due to\n\ntechnical malfunctioning of the EMT measurement apparatus  If  for technical reasons  a\n\nmeasured value is missing  the software puts zeros as entries of the data records  Employing\n\nparticle filter tracking  such anomalous measurements will then lie closer to the regularly\n\nmeasured points but still will not lie on a smooth line  Therefore  data needs to be prepro-\n\ncessed to remove such outliers  To identify any measurement point as outlier  the following\n\ncondition had to be fulfilled  Let x be the signal measured in one spatial direction  then\n\njx   medianðxÞj > 2   stdðxÞ\n\nAfterwards  an SSA can be applied to the sensor signal  Instead of taking only the first com-\n\nponent for further calculation  as in the case of fiducial signals  only the outliers and their\n\nneighboring data entries were replaced by the corresponding entries from the first SSA com-\n\nponent  In this way information about the stop positions could be preserved  An illustrative\n\nexample of an outlier removal is shown in Fig 4 \n\nArtifact removal with an ensemble empirical mode decomposition  After the signal is cor-\n\nrected from noise and outliers  there is still the breathing signal superimposed onto the EMT\n\nsensor signal reflecting its movement inside the catheter  The primary goal of this study is to\n\nautomatically remove this movement artifact with the help of an empirical mode decomposition\n EMD  [33]  [34] and reconstruct the precise shape of the catheter  An EMD [35] can be\n\napplied to any non-stationary and non-linear time series to extract intrinsic modes which\n\nlocally represent pure oscillations with varying amplitude and local frequency  Its noise-assis-\n\nted ensemble variant EEMD [34] avoids mode mixing and boundary artifacts \n\nTo get rid of the breathing artifact  in the current study  an EEMD is applied to the solenoid\n\nsensor signal to extract its underlying intrinsic modes  IMFs  The EEMD is also applied to the\n\nprincipal component of the average signal deduced from the fiducial sensors  As EEMD is\n\nknown to obey the full reconstruction property  the idea obviously is to reconstruct the signal\n\nFig 4  The measured raw sensor signal is drawn in black  and a grey line illustrates the signal\nresulting after outlier removal \n\nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 g004\n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 September 21  2017 10 / 31\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom its components while neglecting the component representing the breathing mode  The\n\ndecomposition of the EMT sensor signal was done within an ensemble E where each time a\ndifferent noise contribution is added during the sifting process  In this study  the size of the\n\nensembles was set to E = 10  The results did not change if a larger size was chosen  Note that\nthe IMFs are sorted naturally by their dominant frequency  Consequently  the highest fre-\n\nquency is in the first IMF  and the last IMF only represents a non-oscillating trend in the time\n\ndependence of the sensor signal  In Fig 5  the original sensor signal and all IMFs resulting\n\nfrom an EEMD are shown \n\nAs a next step  the IMFs which contain the breathing signal had to be identified  To achieve\n\nthis  the EEMD also has been applied to the principal component of the breathing signal mea-\n\nsured with the fiducial sensors  The resulting IMFs are illustrated in Fig 6  If the IMFs from the\n\ntwo signals are compared with each other visually  one recognizes that IMF c 3  from the\nbreathing signal looks very similar in frequency content and spatial shape to IMF c 5  from the\nsensor signal  as well as IMF c 4   breathing  and IMF c 6   sensor  To achieve an automatic\nassignment of corresponding intrinsic modes from both signals  in this study the identification\n\nof the IMF which is similar to the breathing signal is performed employing different similarity\n\nmeasures  Afterwards  the sensor signal was reconstructed while neglecting the contaminating\n\nIMFs  In Fig 7 one catheter is shown  where the breathing motion was removed along each\n\nspatial direction separately \n\nA crucial point during reconstruction  however  is not to loose components containing\n\ninformation about the sensor dwell positions  Thus  a Fast Fourier Transformation  FFT  is\napplied to each IMF from the sensor signal to identify the IMFs containing information about\n\nthe dwell positions  These IMFs cannot be neglected during reconstruction  Having achieved\n\nthis  the sensor signal is reconstructed ignoring those IMFs identified to contain contamina-\n\ntions from artifact signals  This procedure can be repeated several times  Clearly  the methods\n\nwork very efficiently  and the breathing signal could be suppressed completely  Appendix 3\n\nsummarizes the theory of EEMD for the convenience of the reader \n\nSimilarity measures  In the course of this study  sensor signals  measured with an EMT\n\ndevice to follow their path inside any of the catheters implanted in the female breast  are\n\nFig 5

signals\n\ncollected from fiducial sensors which mainly monitor any breathing motion of the patients\n\nduring the EMT measurements  The goal of this procedure is to identify those intrinsic modes\n\nof the sensor signals which most closely resemble the breathing mode artifact  During signal\n\nreconstruction  these artifacts then will be removed from the superposition of the intrinsic\n\nmodes to reconstruct an artifact-free sensor signal  To achieve this goal  proper similarity mea-\n\nsures [36]  [37] between time series need to be explored  Hence in Appendix 4 we will discuss\n\nFig 6  Shown is the spatial fiducial sensor position along one coordinate axis versus discrete time  In the left corner of the top\nrow  the original signal is exposed  The other boxes show

applied to the decomposed sensor\n\nsignals \n\nMulti-dimensional scaling  In this study  MDS finally serves to jointly map positional infor-\n\nmation contained in the CT—image as well as in the EMT measurements  after these data is\n\npre-processed in the way sketched above  First  an X-ray CT—image is taken after surgical\n\nimplantation of the catheters into the female breast  from which a treatment plan is established\n\nand dwell positions and dwell times are defined  Subsequently  sensor dwell position measure-\n\nments are performed during the EMT sessions  which extend over a whole week mostly \n\nBecause of changing relative positions of the female patient in the magnetic field of the field\n\ngenerator of the EMT system  each sensor tracking measurement refers to a different coordi-\n\nnate system  MDS is a shift-invariant technique which only relies on distance information  It\n\nestimates a common principal coordinate system which best explains all observed distances \n\nGiven such a reference coordinate system  any observed deviations from the treatment plan of\n\nthe various sensor dwell positions in the different catheters can be identified  quantified and\n\nconveniently visualized  The basic theory behind MDS is summarized in Appendix 5  see [15]\n\nfor further details \n\nAccuracy  After the breathing compensation  the spatial distribution of the measured dwell\n\npoints reflects the shape of the catheters  If the sensor stopped at a dwell position for a pre-\n\nscribed dwell time  several sampled sensor positions happen to occur at the same spatial loca-\n\ntion  For further computations it is sufficient keeping only one value per stop position  For\n\neach measured point  the related command from the afterloader  if the sensor either stopped\n\nor moved in or out  is known by the recording system as well as the number of the dwell posi-\n\ntion  Consequently  the stop positions can be calculated by averaging over the corresponding\n\npoint clouds belonging to each stop-command  Assume that Ns times a dwell position was\nmeasured by the EMT system at a stop position  For each dwell position  its three-dimensional\n\ncoordinates  referred to the EMT-coordinate system  were collected as components of a col-\n\numn vector xn =  x1n        xNn T  where N = 3  n = 1        Ns  The dwell positions from the treat-\nment plan  according to the CT-coordinate system  can also be summarized in corresponding\n\ncolumn vectors  To compare the two data sets  referred to different coordinate systems  a\n\nmulti-dimensional scaling  MDS  approach was used as is explained in detail in [15]  The MDS\nmaps the two data sets onto a common principal component system  where one can calculate\n\nthe relative deviations from the same dwell point in the two data sets  The values of these devia-\n\ntions were used to characterize the precision of the breathing mode compensation  Especially \n\nthe values calculated from the phantom data were important for the evaluation  because there\n\nno change of catheter shape due to tissue swelling or patient movement could occur \n\nResults and discussion\nPhantom data\nThe preparatory measurements collected EMT sensor data recorded in a phantom fixed to a\n\nmale chest  The sensors measured a superposition of the movement along the catheter and the\n\nbreathing motion  EMT measurements were performed according to the following protocol \n\n• In the first measurement  the male proband tried to achieve a high breathing amplitude by\n\nchest breathing \n\n• In the second experiment  he was breathing calmly via its belly \n\n• In the last experiment  he was breathing while constantly speaking \n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 September 21  2017 13 / 31\n\n\n\n\nThe sensor was moved according to the treatment plan  which was defined based on the X-\n\nray CT images acquired while the phantom was fixed on the CT-table  Between the CT and the\n\nEMT-measurements  the phantom was removed from the CT-table and placed on the chest of\n\nthe male proband  Therefore  some displacements could have been arisen  because of the soft\n\nmaterial of the prosthesis  However  we carefully avoided exerting any strain onto the phan-\n\ntom  hence we never could observe any displacement during the EMT measurements \n\nThe aim of this work was to remove patient movement-related signal components while\n\nprecisely reconstructing the shape of the catheters from EMT measurements alone  The sensor\n\nsignal as well as the breathing signal  which was measured separately on the patient’s chest via\n\nfiducials  could be decomposed by applying an EEMD  Afterwards the signal has been recon-\n\nstructed by adding up all IMFs which did not contain information about the breathing signal \n\nThe human eye is very well suited to grasp similarities between two signals  Therefore  as an\n\nadditional cross-check  the algorithm was applied again to all datasets  but  instead of taking a\n\nsimilarity measure  an experienced data analyst decided which IMF should be deleted  The\n\ngoal of this visual inspection was to not delete any ‘stop’-information and to get rid of breath-\n\ning artifacts  This kind of analysis created kind of a ground truth against which the perfor-\n\nmance of the fully automatic algorithm has to be tested \n\nTo have an accuracy measure  the resulting dwell positions were compared with the dwell\n\npositions defined in the treatment plan  This could be achieved by an algorithm based on\n\nMDS  see Appendix 5 and references given therein  Thus  for each pair of dwell positions  a\n\ndeviation value could be assigned  and  subsequently  an average over all deviations has been\n\ncalculated  In Fig 8  a reconstructed dataset is illustrated including the corresponding colorbar \n\nThe breathing mode was removed automatically from all three data sets obtained with the\n\nphantom  Next  a graph showing the relation between the absolute deviations and the related\n\ndwell positions has been constructed and is presented in Fig 9  displaying the results obtained\n\nfor three different measurements  The vertical lines mark separate catheters  hence show\n\nwhich dwell positions belong to each catheter  The graph corroborates that only small differ-\n\nences between the three reconstructed data have been observed  The dissimilarities are in the\n\nrange of the measurement uncertainty from the measurement system  The displacements\n\nbetween the CT and the EMT-measurements  on average  amounted to no more than 2 3 mm \nThe fact that the mean displacement values from the phantom differed from zero is because \n\n• on the one hand  measurement uncertainties and a high variance in the catheter reconstruc-\n\ntion in the treatment plan exist  and \n\n• on the other hand  the flexible phantom was removed from the CT-table and mounted onto\n\nthe male chest and fixed there  to be able to include a realistic breathing motion artifact in\n\nthe EMT measurements \n\nBoth facts contributed to a systematic but very small finite mean displacement in case of the\n\nphantom data \n\nThe reconstructed results from all three different measurements are very similar corrobo-\n\nrating that the algorithm works well  and also that deviations between both data sets can be\n\nquantify consistently \n\nPatient data\nApart from the preparatory measurements with the breast phantom  EMT sensor data was\n\nrecorded inside the catheters which were implanted into the breast of female patients \n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of

before\n\nthe phantom data  the previously described algorithm was applied to the data  and different\n\nsimilarity measures were applied to identify breathing mode contaminations in the IMFs\n\ndeduced from the EMT sensor signal  First  the well-known Pearson correlation coefficient\n\n PCC  was used to point-wise measure linear similarities  Next  the density—based Kullback-\n\nLeibler divergence  KLD  was employed to account for higher order correlations as well  As a\n\nthird similarity measure representing a real metric  the Jensen-Shannon divergence  JSD  as a\n\nsmoothed and symmetrized version of the KLD was used  Finally  the data was reconstructed\n\nalso while data similarity was judged by a human expert \n\nFig 8  Three dimensional dwell positions

2017 15 / 31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reconstructing the data in four different ways  the dwell positions were compared\n\nwith the dataset provided by the treatment plan  Applying the MDS-method  any mismatch of\n\neach pair of dwell positions could be quantified resulting in a sensitive detection of catheter\n\ndisplacements and bendings  A nice example is given in Fig 10 which shows EMT

deviations  resulting from four different similarity measures\n\napplied to remove breathing mode artifacts  are plotted against the number of dwell positions \n\nAgain  the vertical lines separate the different catheters  It is gratifying to see that all measured\n\ndeviations are almost identical  hence results agree very well between the different methods \n\nThe data reconstructed by the human expert is very similar to the one deduced from the PCC \n\nAll in all  the observed differences between the three automatic methods are smaller than the\n\nmeasurement uncertainty  In case of the JSD  the results occasionally show strong fluctuations\n\n for example see catheters number 12 or 13  A closer inspection of these data reveals that the\n\nbreathing mode from this patient had a small amplitude  resulting in a low signal-to-noise\n\nratio  SNR  Consequently  this breathing mode contamination could not be removed suffi-\n\nciently well and introduced some noise in the reconstructed sensor signals  An example can be\n\nseen in Fig 12  where the same data as shown in Fig 8 was reconstructed with the aid of the\n\nJSD  In the catheters with number 3 or 2 breathing artifacts are still visible \n\nFig 11  Absolute deviations for each pair of dwell positions  CT-EMT  are shown for four different\nreconstructed measurements  The black vertical lines mark the

values are summarized in\n\nTable 2  Only small differences between the three different ways of reconstruction are\n\nobserved  The mean deviations for the three phantom measurements are almost identical \n\nConsequently  between the acquisition of the CT and the measurement on the male chest  a\n\ndisplacement of roughly 2 3 mm occurred  It is especially noteworthy that values resulting\nfrom the Jensen-Shannon divergence do not deviate much from the results of other similarity\n\nmeasures  although by employing the JSD  the breathing mode artifact could not always be\n\nremoved completely  This is because the breathing mode amplitude is in most patients small\n\ncompared to the dissimilarities which happen  Only for patient 1  the mean deviation is larger\n\nwhen determined using the JSD than when using other similarity measures \n\nIn summary  the automatic removal of breathing artifacts worked very well for each dataset \n\nMost importantly  it did not matter whether the patient was breathing while speaking or\n\nbreathing calmly  The only disadvantage  data with breathing mode artifacts from speaking\n\npatients carry with them  is a loss of ‘stop’-information \n\nConclusion\nHigh Dose Rate Brachytherapy  HDR-BT  encompasses the irradiation of a tumor bed after\n\nthe cancerous tissue has been removed during a surgical intervention  Lumpectomy  During\n\nradiation therapy  a high activity radiation source will be positioned in close proximity to the\n\ntumor bed via catheters which are implanted surgically into the female breast  The spatial posi-\n\ntion of the radiation source inside these catheters is determined via an electromagnetic track-\n\ning  EMT  device  During radiation treatment  the source is moved inside the catheters while\n\nstopping at pre-defined dwell positions for predefined dwell times  The latter data are estab-\n\nlished  relative to the patient’s anatomy  from an initial X-ray computed tomography  CT \n\nimage by a medical physicist  During the radiation treatment sessions  which are scheduled\n\nduring one week roughly  catheter displacements occur due to patient movements  breathing\n\netc  Assuring a proper radiation treatment in accord with the treatment plan  source positions\n\nneed to be ascertained each time  a treatment session is scheduled  Such control measurements\n\nare performed using solenoid sensors instead of radiation sources whose movement inside the\n\ncatheters follows the treatment plan and whose spatial positions are determined with an elec-\n\ntromagnetic tracking  EMT  device  The current study develops an automatic analysis tool of\n\nsuch EMT data sets  recorded with a solenoid sensor  to either corroborate concordance of the\n\nsource movement with the treatment plan or precisely quantify a spatial displacement that\n\nmight have been occurred  The tool combines machine learning techniques such as\n\n• a particle filter  PF  to precisely track the dwell positions of the solenoid sensor inside the\ncatheters implanted in a female breast \n\n• a singular spectrum analysis  SSA  as a proper technique for removing high amplitude arti-\nfacts such as resulting from measurement device malfunctioning \n\nTable 2  Collection of all mean deviations  measured in mm  for all datasets as obtained with four different

analysis  SSA  is a well-known signal analysis technique to solve such\n\ndiverse problems as  for example  smoothing  detrending and extracting structures in short \n\nnoisy  chaotic  time series  It first appeared in [40]  [41]  became known more widespread\n\nthrough the work of [42]  [43]  but received public interest only after the seminal work of Ghil\n\n[28]  A thorough account of SSA was also provided by [29]  while [31] discussed a linear\n\ninvariant systems perspective of SSA  A decomposition of the original time series into a sum of\n\northogonal components is the aim of SSA  Thus second order correlations of the time series\n\nbecome decorrelated  Most of these components can be interpreted as trends  structureless\n\nwhite noise or oscillatory components  Furthermore  any parametric model of the considered\n\ntime series has not to be known \n\nLet x t  =  x t1      x tT T  xT =  x1     xT T be a real-valued  zero mean time series with\ntotal length T  After selecting an embedding dimension K and a proper segment length L  T\nsuch that T = K + L − 1  we have xk =  xk        xk+ L−1 T  Any analysis of such a time series with\nSSA requires two steps [44]  [31] \n\n• a decomposition step  which encompasses embedding of the time series into K delayed coor-\ndinates combined with an eigendecomposition of a correlation matrix  and\n\n• a reconstruction step  which encompasses anti-diagonal averaging and reverting the\nembedding \n\nDecomposition \n\n• Embedding\n\nIn general  time series represent uni-variate signals  while any decomposition technique\n\nrequires multi-variate signals  Hence  a standard procedure in time series analysis is embed-\n\nding the latter in its delayed coordinates  For that purpose  the uni-variate and zero mean\n\ntime series segment xL =  x1     xL T is transformed into a multi-variate set of delayed time\nseries x1     xK with column vectors xk ¼ ðxk       xkþL  1Þ\n\nT\n  k ¼ 1         K 2 RL  The transfor-\n\nmation  thus  is effected by an embedding of the original time series into delayed coordi-\n\nnates  Note that each time series has L entries  but the embedding space has dimension\n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 September 21  2017 20 / 31\n\n\n\n\nK  K holds in most SSA applica-\ntions—a setting that we will assume to apply throughout this study \n\n• Eigendecomposition\n\nConsidering the matrix dot product XT X  we obtain a K × K—dimensional  symmetric and\nreal-valued correlation matrix R which possesses an eigendecomposition according to\n\nðXTXÞvk ¼ Rvk ¼ lkvk\n\nwhere λ1         λK denote the non-zero  ordered eigenvalues and vk the

measures\nLinear correlations  An often used similarity measure between two data sets considers a\n\npointwise  linear correlation between the variables  The underlying statistic of the stochastic\n\nvariables follow a normal distribution  Though not always encountered in practice  it is often a\n\nreasonable first order approximation to estimate the similarity between the two stochastic\n\nprocesses \n\nPearson correlation  One of the most popular measures of correlation between variables is\n\nthe Pearson correlation coefficient  It was first described by Karl Pearson in [48]  Let\nx =  x1     xL T and y =  y1     yL T be two time series segments with size L  T  represented as\nvectors in an L-dimensional space  The definition of the Pearson correlation coefficient c is as\nfollows \n\nPCCðx yÞ ¼\nL\nXL\n\nl¼1\nxlyl  \n\nXL\n\nl¼1\nxl\n\n    XL\n\nl¼1\nyl\n\n

ð16Þ\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient can vary between −1 and 1 [49]  [50] and helps to identify\nthe latent intrinsic mode of the sensor signals most similar to the breathing mode artifact \n\nNon-linear correlations  If linear correlations do not apply  similarity between two sto-\n\nchastic processes should be based on metrics defined by distributions of the variables in the\n\ndata sets  The basis of such metrics is laied by the information-theoretic entropy  also known\n\nas Shannon entropy [51]  [52]  A related measure based on it is the mutual information and\n\nseveral divergences [53]  which are shortly summarized next \n\n• Shannon entropy and Mutual information\n\nIn information theory  entropy measures the average surprise that comes along with an\n\nevent xl with occurrence probability p xl  The expected information  the event carries with\nit  is known as Shannon entropy and is given by\n\nHðXÞ ¼ HðpðxlÞÞ ¼\nX\n\nl\n\npðxlÞ log\n1\n\npðxlÞ\n\n   \n\n¼  \nX\n\nl\npðxlÞ log ðpðxlÞÞ\n\nwhere X represents a stochastic variable whose realizations are denoted by xT =  x1  x2       \nxL  Information entropy  thus  can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty  i  e  the\namount of information an event carries with when taking place  and the dispersion of the\n\nprobabilities with which the events take place \n\nRelated to Shannon entropy is mutual information  MI  between two signals  say X * p x \nand Y * p y  and is defined as\n\nIðY XÞ ¼ IðpðyÞ  pðxÞÞ ¼ HðYÞ   HðYjXÞ ¼ HðXÞ   HðXjYÞ ¼ IðX YÞ\n\nwhere X and Y denote multi-variate stochastic variables with related joint probability densi-\nties p x  and q y  respectively  For example  X denotes an intrinsic mode of an EMT sensor\nsignal and Y denotes an intrinsic mode of a fiducial sensor signal  MI measures the amount\nof information  an EMT sensor mode carries about a fiducial sensor mode [54  55]  In multi-\n\nchannel biomedical systems  MI is most frequently used to measure the amount of\n\nAutomatic analysis of EMT—HDR-BT of breast cancer patients\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183608 September 21  2017 25 / 31\n\n\n\n\nindependence between both modes  Hence  the most convenient property of mutual infor-\n\nmation is its disappearance if and only if X and Y are statistically independent  Or  vice versa\nand relevant for our considerations  the larger I X  Y  is  the more similar both signals are  i \ne  the less uncertain we are about one signal knowing the other  Contrary to Pearson correla-\n\ntion  PC  Shannon entropy and MI both rely on distributions rather than pointwise com-\n\nparisons  where non-linear correlations are contained in the distributions  Note that in case\n\nof signals having Gaussian distributions  both similarity measures  i  e  PC and MI  become\n\nequivalent  However  as MI has a lower bound only  corresponding to statistical indepen-\n\ndence of both signals  it is less well suited to directly measure similarity between signals \n\n• Kullback—Leibler divergence\n\nThe Kullback—Leibler divergence  KLD  [56]  also called relative Entropy  is a non-symmet-\nric measure of similarity between two distributions P and Q\n\nDKLðX k YÞ   DKLðpðxÞ k qðyÞÞ ¼\nXL\n\nl¼1\n\npðx^ lÞ ln\npðx^ lÞ\nqðy^ lÞ\n\n   \n\nwhere the stochastic variables need to be normalized according to\n\ny^ l ¼\nyl\n\nPL\nl¼1 yl\n\nand x^ l ¼\nxl\n\nPL\nl¼1 xl\n\nOccasionally it is said to measure the distance between two distributions but this is unfortu-\n\nnate as KLD does not fulfill the triangle inequality  However  it can be understood as the loss\n\nof information if p x  is modeled by means of q y  If both are equal  there is no loss and the\nKLD becomes zero  Thus it offers a very convenient measure of similarity  though not really\n\ncorresponding to a valid distance metric  and we have\n\nDKLðP k QÞ   0 and DKLðP k QÞ ¼ 0 iff pðxÞ ¼ qðyÞ ð17Þ\n\nAlternatively  the KLD tells one the amount of information obtained per observation of X\nthat allows one to discriminate between the two distributions p x  and q y  In this study \np x  might represent an intrinsic mode from the EMT sensor signal  and q y  might repre-\nsent an intrinsic mode from the fiducial sensor signal  The goal is to identify the intrinsic\n\nmode from the EMT sensor signal which most closely resembles the breathing mode from\n\nthe fiducial sensor signal  Hence  in practice  p x  and q y  are derived from observations\nand sample counting  That is  p x  and q y  are probability distributions derived from fre-\nquency distributions  The derivation of a probability distribution from an observed fre-\n\nquency distribution is called smoothing  If one of the binned distributions contains zeros as\n\nentries  one can replace them by a small quantity    10−3  Related with this  an important\n\nassumption is that p xl  = 0  q yl  = 0 which furthermore implies that in this case\n\npðxlÞ ln\npðxlÞ\nqðylÞ\n\n   \n¼ 0  A general convention is that 0ln 0/q y  = 0 for any q y  and p x ln p x /\n\n0 =1 if p x >0 \nConsidering the relation of relative entropy DKL to mutual information I X  Y  we have for\ntwo stochastic variables X and Y\n\nIðpðxÞ  pðyÞÞ ¼ DKLðpðx  yÞ k pðxÞpðyÞÞ\n\n¼\nXL\n\nl l0¼1\n\npðxl  yl0 Þ ln\npðxl  yl0 Þ\npðxlÞpðyl0 Þ\n\n   \nð18Þ\n\nAutomatic

divergence  JSD  [57]  [58] is another similarity measure between two\nprobability distributions  It is based on the KullbackLeibler divergence  KLD  but it is sym-\nmetric and its value is always finite  Indeed  the JSD is a symmetrized and smoothed version\n\nof the KLD  Furthermore  the square root of the JensenShannon divergence is a metric often\n\nreferred to as Jensen-Shannon distance dJS ¼\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nJSD\np\n\n \n\nGiven two realizations p x  q y  of discrete probability distributions P  Q  the JSD P k Q  is\ndefined as\n\nJSDðP k QÞ ¼\n1\n\n2\nDKL P k\n\nP þ

= 1/2  This latter\nrelation  obviously  can be trivially generalized to more than two distributions  This defini-\n\ntion shows that the JSD is a symmetrized version of two KLDs measuring the similarity of\n\neach of the two considered distributions with their corresponding mixture distribution  The\n\nJSD obeys the following bounds \n\n0   JSDðP QÞ   ln ð2Þ if log e is used\n\n0   JSDðP QÞ   1 if log 2 is used\n\nThe Jensen—Shannon divergence is intimately related to mutual information  To see that\n\nconsider a superposition of the two distributions X =  P + Q /2  where p x  represents the\ndistribution related with an intrinsic mode of the EMT sensor signal and q y  represents a\ndistribution related with an intrinsic mode of the fiducial sensor signal  Consider next an\n\nindicator variable Z|z 2  0  1  Let the indicator variable Z be used to switch between the two\ndistributions  i  e  choose p x  if z = 0 and q x  if z = 1  Then we obtain for the mutual infor-\nmation I X  Z  the following relation\n\n0   IðX ZÞ ¼ HðXÞ   HðXjZÞ ¼ JSDðP QÞ   1 ð21Þ\n\nHence  if both distributions become identical  P = Q  then the conditional information\nentropy H X|Z  becomes independent of the indicator variable Z and the mutual informa-\ntion I X  Z  becomes zero  This implies that also the JSD and its related JS distance become\nzero \n\nAppendix 5—Multi-dimensional scaling\nIn HDR-BT dwell positions of a radiation source inside catheters implanted into a female\n\nbreast are defined by a treatment plan which is deduced from an initial X-ray CT image  As a\n\nradiation treatment is repeated during a couple of subsequent days  dwell positions need to be\n\nchecked by a EMT measurement inserting a solenoid sensor into the catheters before the radi-\n\nation treatment  The spatial coordinates of the sensor at the various dwell positions in the mag-\n\nnetic field of a field generator are recorded  However  such coordinates refer to a different\n\ncoordinate system in each session  As we proposed recently  such difficulties can be alleviated\n\nby recourse to multi-dimensional scaling techniques which only rely on distances  see

is recommended for invasive breast cancer  which includes surgical\n\ntreatment with either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery  adjuvant chemotherapy  adju-\n\nvant radiotherapy  and hormone therapy  etc  Appropriate use of the evidence-based care\n\ncould reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence  increase survival  and improve the quality of\n\nlife [1  2]  However  underuse of these effective treatments is widespread [3  4]  Patient and\n\nhospital characteristics such as age  race/ethnicity and type of hospital were found to be associ-\n\nated with the receipt of cancer care [5  6]  Besides  patients’ access to care  which could be\n\nenhanced by health insurance coverage  could account in part for the underuse of evidence-\n\nbased care [7] With the increasing attention paid to cancer care and its relation with health\n\ninsurance  a body of literature has examined whether disparities in quality of care and clinical\n\noutcomes existed for patients with varying insurance types [8–10]  Previous studies in USA\n\nhave demonstrated that patients with no insurance or Medicaid were most likely to be diag-\n\nnosed at later stages of cancer and receive less than optimal clinical care [9  11  12]  In addition \n\nuninsured or Medicaid patients experienced higher mortality and lower survival compared to\n\nprivate insurance patients [8  13]  As for breast cancer  though some studies have found signifi-\n\ncant influence of insurance type on utilization of evidence-based care  most of the studies only\n\nevaluated limited aspects of care  The continuum from preoperative diagnosis procedures to\n\nadjuvant therapy was seldom investigated \n\nIn most instances  medical security system comprised several insurance types which have\n\ndifferent coverages and proportions of reimbursement  For instance  in order to build a medi-\n\ncal security system covering all the residents  the government of China had put forward three\n\nhealth insurance schemes  including UEBMI  urban employment basic medical insurance \n\nNCMS  new rural cooperative medical scheme  and URBMI  urban resident basic medical\n\ninsurance  [14] The coverage of three health insurance schemes had been expanded to 95 7%\n\n[15]  Among the three insurance schemes  UEBMI covers only 19% of population  but has the\n\nhighest reimbursement rate  85–95% varying with the amount of medical expenses  Reim-\n\nbursement rate of patients covered by NCMS and URBMI ranges from 50% to 65% according\n\nto the level of hospital in which patients seek treatment  and they together cover 78% of Chi-\n\nnese population including rural residents and students  children  unemployed  elderly  dis-\n\nabled living in urban communities [16]  Therefor it is of great significance to pay more\n\nattention to the quality of care for most of the patients having sub-optimal financial support \n\nThis study aimed to explore the influence of lower insurance reimbursement rates on utili-\n\nzation of evidence-based breast cancer care from preoperative diagnosis procedures to adju-\n\nvant therapy  which could contribute to the evidence pool based on which relevant healthcare\n\npolicies would be designed to improve effective access to care particularly for severe disease\n\nsuch as cancer  Meanwhile  preoperative and total length of hospital were compared to exam-\n\nine the hypothesis that under- and over-consumption of health resources may exist across dif-\n\nferent insurance reimbursement rates \n\nMaterials and methods\nData sources\nIn this retrospective study  participants were identified as women aged 18 to 69 years with a\n\nprimary discharge diagnosis of invasive breast cancer  identified by International classification\n\nof disease

or missing health insurance status were\n\nalso excluded  n = 134  Finally  a total of 3669 patients who met the inclusion criteria were\n\nrecruited in the study  Data were collected from medical records of patients diagnosed with\n\ninvasive breast cancer in nine tertiary hospitals  including three specialized tumor hospitals\n\nand six general hospitals  This research was approved by Institutional Research Board of Har-\n\nbin Medical University  Informed consent was obtained from all cases  and data was accessed\n\nanonymously \n\nData collection\nThe process of data collection is similar to one of our previous studies [17]  Information on\n\npatient demographics  tumor characteristics  diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer as well\n\nas data elements essential for identifying eligible patients for use of each treatment were\n\nextracted from medical records  Before the data collection  operation manual of data abstrac-\n\ntion was formulated and data abstractors were trained for 2 weeks by an oncology professional\n\nand the leading researcher of the study team  During the formal data collection period  the\n\nleading abstractor randomly sampled 10% of the reviewed records and the inter-rater agree-\n\nment was up to 95% \n\nDependent variables of interest\nSeven of the quality indicators which were previously developed by our research team were\n\ndetermined as dependent variables of interest in the study [18]  The quality indicators included\n\npreoperative core biopsy  SLNB  sentinel lymph nodes biopsy  BCS  breast conserving sur-\n\ngery  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2  HER-2  testing before systemic therapy \n\nreceiving at least 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy  adjuvant radiotherapy after mastectomy \n\nand hormonal treatment  Table 1  These indicators were examined throughout breast cancer\n\ncare  from preoperative diagnosis to postoperative adjuvant therapy  Each quality indicator\n\nwas dichotomous and expressed as percentage  While the denominator of the percentage\n\ndenoted patients who were eligible without contraindications for the treatment  the numerator\n\ndenoted eligible patients who actually received the treatment  A composite indicator was con-\n\nstructed by All-or-None method which represents the percentage of patients for whom all\n\nTable 1  Definitions of quality indicators

health insurance coverage as one of the policy goals to be achieved during the new round\n\nof healthcare reform [20]  Although the universal basic health insurance coverage has been\n\nachieved by 2011  noticeable disparities existed among different reimbursement ratio \n\nThe effect of insurance status on receipt of breast cancer care was reported by a number of\n\nstudies [12  21]  A study using data from the National Program of Cancer Registries found\n\npatients with Medicaid were less likely to receive guideline-concordant chemotherapy after\n\nadjusting for age  registry  and clinical variables [5]  Moreland A et al [22] observed that pri-\n\nvate insured patients were more likely to receive BCS than patients with Medicare or no insur-\n\nance  However  few studies have explored the impact of health insurance on the continuum of\n\nbreast cancer care from preoperative diagnosis procedures to postoperative adjuvant treat-\n\nments  Moreover  to date  there were few studies that have examined the effect of health insur-\n\nance on utilization of breast cancer care in China and other developing countries  Our study\n\nfound substantial underuse in the continuum of breast cancer care and significant disparities\n\nin the receipt of treatments among different reimbursement ratio even after adjustment for\n\npatient and provider characteristics  Compared with UEBMI  patients with lower rate of reim-\n\nbursement had less likelihood of receiving standard breast cancer care  including core biopsy \n\nHER-2 testing  BCS and adjuvant treatment \n\nPreoperative core biopsy could inform patients of their diagnosis before the first treatment \n\nthus enable them to make decisions about neoadjuvant chemotherapy and type of surgery\n\n[23]  The lower rate of core biopsy among patients of NCMS and URBMI may partly attribute\n\nto patient’ inactive involvement in the process of decision-making for treatment schedule \n\nTable 4  Preoperative and total

 Additional inpatient cost could be needed for the core\n\nbiopsy  This may partially explain the lower rate of core biopsy among NCMS and URBMI\n\ninsured patients  since those patients are very likely in worse economic condition and have less\n\nfinancial support  Confirmation of HER-2 status is critical for determining whether patients\n\nshould receive biological target therapy [24]  In China  positive HER-2 status is presented in\n\n20–30% of breast cancer patients  However  since biological target therapy is expensive and\n\nhas not been covered by public health insurance during the study period  NCMS and URBMI\n\ninsured patients  who had relatively low socioeconomic status  were discouraged to confirm\n\nthe HER-2 status \n\nIn the last decade  BCS has been recommended as preferred surgical modality for early-\n\nstage breast cancer worldwide  BCS could improve quality of life for patients with breast cancer\n\nand produce similar survival rate to mastectomy when it is combined with appropriate radio-\n\ntherapy [25  26]  In our study  the overall rate of BCS was only 9 57%  substantially lower than\n\nthe rate in USA and other developed countries [27  28]  Previous studies found characteristics\n\nof patients  including age  race  income  education  understanding of the disease and family\n\nsupport  were related to the choice of BCS [29–31]  In China  patients had misunderstanding\n\nof BCS and feared that BCS cannot completely resect the tumor  which  in the perception of\n\nmost patients  will lead to recurrence and metastasis [32]  Moreover  radiotherapy  which is\n\nrequired after BCS and result in additional expenses  would also obstruct patients from receiv-\n\ning BCS  Doctors also played an important role in patient’s decision-making for surgical\n\nmethod  Several studies have observed that patients who received recommendations for BCS\n\nfrom doctors were more likely to receive BCS than those who were recommended for mastec-\n\ntomy [32  33]  However  doctors were unlikely to recommend BCS to their patients  because of\n\nthe strained relationship between doctors and patients in China [34]  To protect themselves\n\nfrom possible medical disputes  Chinese doctors were inclined to recommend mastectomy\n\ninstead of BCS to patients  Our study found NCMS insured patients had the lowest rate of BCS\n\nrelative to those insured by UEBMI  since patients insured by NCMS are rural populations\n\nwho have relatively low income  poor understanding of disease  and less family support com-\n\npared to UEBMI insured patients \n\nReceiving appropriate adjuvant therapy would reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence\n\nand metastasis  and improve survival of breast cancer patients  Our study observed not only\n\nremarkable underuse of adjuvant treatments  but also the significant variations in utilization of\n\nthose adjuvant treatments among patients with different insurance types  NCMS insured\n\npatients were unlikely to receive the adjuvant treatments  which could attribute to their low\n\nsocioeconomic status  transport difficulties  and the lack of understanding of the importance\n\nof adjuvant therapy  A common problem with retrospective analysis is that data regarding use\n\nof endocrine therapy can be difficult to collect  since it consists of oral outpatient treatment \n\nHowever  the patients taking hormonal therapy were identified based on information from\n\nthree sources  discharge instruction  medication prescription record  and follow-up informa-\n\ntion in this study  Therefore  the oral outpatient treatment can be identified by any of the\n\naforementioned means and the data about endocrine therapy was considered to be accurate\n\nenough  Still  we repeated the analysis excluding endocrine treatment  and the result did not\n\ndiffer substantially  The rate of composite indicator was 8 56%  Compared with UEBMI\n\n 9 77%  patients of NCMS  6 33%  had significantly lower score  After adjusting for con-\n\nfounding variables  NCMS insured group also had lower rate of composite indicator\n\n OR = 0 500  95% CI = 0 370–0 676 \n\nPatient characteristics  including socioeconomic status  education background  and family/\n\nsocial support  tend to differ across types of health insurance  More important  the substantial\n\nQuality of invasive breast cancer care

also account for\n\nthe disparities in utilization of breast cancer care  For example  the reimbursement rate of\n\ninpatients covered by NCMS and URBMI was 50%  which was much lower than that of\n\nUEBMI  85%-95%  Low reimbursement rate of medical expenses  which implies high out-of-\n\npocket payment  could affect patients’ care-seeking behavior  To mitigate the financial risk\n\ncaused by cancer care  as well as other major disease  and promote the utilization of care\n\namong the disadvantaged patients  China planned to set up complementary reinsurance pro-\n\ngram for major chronic illness among NCMS and URBMI insured patients [35]  Through the\n\nnationwide implementation of the reinsurance program and deepening of the healthcare\n\nreform  the disparities in utilization of breast cancer care across different insurance schemes\n\ncould be gradually reduced \n\nTo be noted  there were no significant differences in preoperative length of hospital stay\n\nacross different insurance schemes  implying uniform preoperative waiting time regardless of\n\ninsurance type  Beyond our expectation  the over- and under-consumption of health resources\n\nin UEBMI and NCMS insured patients were not observed  Patients insured by URBMI stayed\n\nlonger in hospital than the other insurance groups  since they were older and more likely to\n\npresent with coexisting diseases \n\nThe study had several limitations  First  the impacts of health insurance on clinical out-\n\ncomes of breast cancer patients were not examined  in the study  five-year survival of patient\n\ninformation was unavailable as the duration of follow up has not yet reached five years  mean-\n\nwhile  inpatient mortality and occurrence of postoperative complications were both rare for\n\npatients with stage I-III breast cancer  which were inappropriate to be evaluated as short-term\n\noutcomes  Second  only tertiary teaching hospitals located in urban areas were included in the\n\nstudy  which may limit the generalization of our findings  In future studies  more types of hos-\n\npital  such as non-teaching  private-owned  community and second-class hospitals  should be\n\ninvestigated  and potential interaction between hospital characteristics and health insurance\n\non breast cancer care should be fully explored  Finally  due to the limitation of hospital infor-\n\nmation system  information of some confounding variables  such as education level and per-\n\nsonal income  were not acquirable in the study  The area-level measure of income  instead of\n\npatient income  was gathered  which may attenuate the effect of income on utilization of care \n\nConclusions\nThe study observed substantial inequality of utilization of evidence-based breast cancer care\n\nacross different insurance schemes  Compared with UEBMI  patients with NCMS and URBMI\n\nwere less likely to receive preoperative diagnostic procedures  BCS  and adjuvant treatment \n\nwhich suggested significant underuse of the continuum of breast cancer care among the\n\ninsured patients with low level of reimbursement  The findings of this study provide important\n\nsupport for further health care reform aiming at equalizing the insurance benefits and the\n\nquality improvement in breast cancer care \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  Adjusted

glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin \n\nreductases 1 2 As the selenium nanoparticles  SeNPs  possess antimicrobial and anti-\n\ncancer properties  they can be used as nanomedicines 3 4 Also  they exhibit less toxicity \n\nas compared to their inorganic and organic counterparts 5 Thus  their methods of \n\nsynthesis need to be studied in detail  SeNPs can be synthesized by physical  chemi-\n\ncal and biological routes 4 6 7 Methods of biological synthesis of SeNPs are less toxic  \n\necofriendly and cost-effective  and yield stable SeNPs which do not aggregate because \n\nof a protein coating over them 8 9 However  the activity of these SeNPs has not been \n\ncompared with chemically synthesized SeNPs \n\nNanoparticles  NPs  possess size- and shape-dependent properties  Such properties \n\nneed to be explored and hence  it is the need of the hour to have procedures enabling \n\na higher degree of control over the sizes of SeNPs 10 11 In biological systems  various \n\nparameters are known to modulate the synthesis and morphology of NPs 8 12–14 There are \n\ncorrespondence  Balu a chopade\nDr Babasaheb ambedkar Marathwada \nUniversity  aurangabad-431004

optimization of parameters to control the size \n\nand shape of gold and silver NPs 12 13 However  such studies \n\nare missing on SeNPs  necessitating a need for a thorough \n\nstudy to enhance the overall properties of SeNPs \n\nMany bacteria  fungi and plants are reported to synthe-\n\nsize SeNPs 4 However  there is no report on the synthesis \n\nof SeNPs by Acinetobacter sp  Acinetobacter is a diverse \n\ngroup of organisms and present ubiquitously in nature 15–21 \n\nThey have excellent biofilm-forming capability 22–25 They \n\nhave high degree of antibiotic and metal resistance 16 26 27 \n\nAcinetobacter is known to synthesize gold  silver and \n\nplatinum NPs 12 13 28 Acinetobacter sp  SW30 isolated from \n\nactivated sewage sludge is reported to produce polyhedral-\n\nshaped gold

synthesize SeNPs using cell \n\nsuspension and TCP of Acinetobacter sp  SW30  BSeNPs  and \n\nto study the influence of physiological and physicochemical \n\nparameters on their synthesis and

spectra were recorded from 200 to \n\n800 nm on Spectra Max M2 Multimode Microplate Reader \n\n Molecular Devices LLC  Sunnyvale  CA  USA  and those \n\nshowing maximum synthesis of SeNPs were observed under \n\ntransmission electron microscopy  TEM \n\nOptimization of parameters for obtaining \nseNPs in nanometer size\nTEM observation showed that the biosynthesized SeNPs were \n\nmore than 100 nm in size  However  in our previous studies  \n\nit was observed that various physicochemical parameters \n\nsuch as culture age  cell density  metal salt concentration  \n\ntemperature and pH have profound effect on the rate of syn-\n\nthesis and morphology of NPs 12 Hence  the effect of such \n\nparameters on SeNPs was studied in order to get particles of \n\nsize  100 nm  The effect of

was considered the optimum  On the contrary  \n\nthere was no significant effect of different Se concentrations \n\non the morphology of SeNPs synthesized by Shewanella sp  \n\nHN-41 and Lactobacillus sp 35 36 Streptomyces bikiniensis can \n\nsynthesize nanorods of size 17 nm 37\n\nIt was observed that during the period of incubation  \n\nshape of elemental Se changed from spherical to rod-like \n\nstructure  After 6 h  spheres were observed  while after 48 h \n\nof incubation  length of particles increased in one dimension \n\nand they were converted into rods  It may be owing to the \n\nOstwald ripening process evoked by the high free energy of \n\nSeNPs 37 In our studies  synthesis of Se rods could be due \n\nto the Ostwald ripening process at higher concentration of \n\nNa\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n  Lortie et al found that increase in selenite concen-\n\ntration increased the reduction rate up to 19 mM of selenite \n\nand above 19 mM  selenite reduction rate was decreased due \n\nto toxicity of selenite 39\n\nTemperature and pH are known as size and shape \n\nmodulating agents 39 Synthesis of SeNPs was observed at \n\n30°C and 37°C  with maximum synthesis observed at 37°C \n Figure 1D  Our results are similar to Lortie et al  they also \n\ncould not get synthesis of SeNPs at higher temperature 39 \n\nThe reason can be that the biomolecules/proteins respon-\n\nsible for the reduction of sodium selenite are active only at \n\n30°C and 37°C  So  37°C was considered as the optimum \n\ntemperature  Synthesis of SeNPs by Citrus reticulata peel \n\nextract was found to be efficient at 40°C 40 An increase in \ntemperature from 80°C to 100°C causes aggregation of NPs \ninto rods 39\n\nSurprisingly  at 1 5 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentration  synthesis \n\nof SeNPs was noticed at all tested pH except at pH 2  while \n\nat 3 0 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentration  synthesis of SeNPs was \n\nnoticed at all tested pH values  At pH 2 and 1 5 mM  pos-\n\nsibly fewer functional groups are available  which are not \n\nsufficient for the reduction process 11 At 1 5 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n \n\nconcentration  synthesis of SeNPs increased with increase \n\nin pH up to 9  However  at 3 0 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentration  \n\nsynthesis increased up to pH 6  and then it reduced  Also  \n\nthe spectra changed because of the different morphology of \n\nSeNPs  Figure 1E and F  TEM analysis was conducted at \n\npH 6  7 and 9 for both the Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentrations  Sele-\n\nnium spheres and rods were observed at 3 0 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n \n\nconcentration  while at 1 5 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentration  only \n\nspheres were observed  Figure 3  From TEM images  it was \n\nconcluded that there is no significant effect of pH on the size \n\nof SeNPs  On the contrary  others have found significant \n\ninfluence of pH on SeNP size  In case of enzyme purified \n\nfrom Geobacillus wiegeii  the size of all NPs was  100 nm \nat pH 4  Over 50% of NPs were  100 nm in size at pH 5 \nand 90% were of size  100 nm at pH 6 and 8  At pH 7  NPs \nwere of size 120 nm and only 20% were  100 nm  So  acidic \n\nFigure 2 TeM micrographs of

concentra-\n\ntions of TCP against all the Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentrations from \n\n0 1 to 4 0 mM  However  the spectra of three of TCP were \n\ndifferent from each other due to different shapes and

\n\nHowever  for 3 mg/mL TCP concentration  3 5 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n \n\nconcentration gave maximum synthesis  Figure 4C  Inter-\n\nestingly  when SeNPs of 4 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n synthesized using \n\n1 mg/mL of TCP were centrifuged  very nice green color was \n\nobserved in the supernatant  remaining particles were orange \n\ncolored  which settled at the bottom  When this green

there were prominent peaks at 390 and 570 nm  At \n\n3 mg/mL  a single peak at 350 nm was observed  When these \n\nparticles were observed under TEM and their particle size \n\nwas measured using ImageJ software  it was found that at 1  \n\n2 and 3 mg/mL TCP concentration  the average particle size \n\nwas 158  184 and 211 nm  respectively  This indicates that \n\naverage particle size increases with increasing concentration \n\nof TCP  That is why  1 mg/mL can be used for further studies  \n\nThere is no report on synthesis of SeNPs by TCP \n\ncharacterization of BseNPs\nThe

Acinetobacter sp  SW30 with that \n\nof chemical ones  Both types of SeNPs showed antipro-\n\nliferative activity against 4T1 cells in a dose-dependent \n\nmanner  Figure 7A  Figure 7B represents the antiprolif-\n\nerative activity of SeNPs against NIH/3T3 cells  However  \n\nCSeNPs  20 7%  showed more inhibition of cell viability \n\nthan BSeNPs  53 5%  at 100 µg/mL  Similar results were \n\nobserved in MCF-7 cells  CSeNPs  15 8%  exhibited more \n\ninhibition of cell viability than BSeNPs  26 6%  as shown \n\nin Figure 8A  CSeNPs  97 nm size  had a zeta potential \n\nof −13 mV  whereas BSeNPs  94 nm size  had +10 mV \n Figure 9  Secretion of large amount of lactate anions from \n\ncancer cells and exposure of more phospholipids on the sur-\n\nface of breast cancer cells lead to negatively charged surface \n\nof cancer cells as compared to fibroblasts  thus  positively \n\ncharged BSeNPs may have strong affinity for breast cancer \n\ncells  causing enhanced anticancer efficacy of BSeNPs 43–45 \n\nThus  CSeNPs  31%  showed comparatively more inhibi-\n\ntion in NIH/3T3 cells than BSeNPs  77%  at 100 µg/mL \n Figure 7B  In case of HEK293  CSeNPs  17%  caused \n\nmore

migration in HePG2 cells 53\n\nConclusion\nAcinetobacter sp  SW30 was found to synthesize intracel-\n\nlular SeNPs which were characterized by different physico-\n\nchemical techniques such as UV–Vis spectrophotometry  \n\nXRD  SEM  energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and \n\nTEM  The 18 h grown culture with 2 7×109 cfu/mL could \nsynthesize amorphous nanospheres of size 78 nm at 1 5 mM \n\nand crystalline nanorods at 2 0 mM Na\n2\nSeO\n\n3\n concentration \n\nonward  The pH had no significant effect on the morphology \n\nof SeNPs  Polygonal-shaped SeNPs of average size 79 nm \n\nwere obtained in the supernatant of 4 mg/mL of TCP  \n\nFTIR studies have confirmed that proteins are the essential \n\nmolecules for the reduction and coating of SeNPs  Though \n\nCSeNPs have shown more anticancer activity than BSeNPs  \n\nthey are toxic to noncancer cells also  hence  BSeNPs are a \n\ngood alternative to anticancer agents \n\nAcknowledgment\nSAW and RS acknowledge the University

Longer \nfollow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had estrogen receptor–positive \ntumors that may recur later in the disease course  the ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for \nClinical Trials in Oncology \nOBJECTIVE—To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph \nnode metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node dissection \n SLND  alone without axillary lymph node dissection  ALND  is noninferior to that of women \ntreated with axillary dissection \n\nDESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS—The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized \nclinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites  both academic and \ncommunity medical centers  The last date of follow-up was September 29  2015  in the ACOSOG \nZ0011  Alliance  trial  Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer  \nno palpable axillary adenopathy  and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases \n\nINTERVENTIONS—All patients had planned lumpectomy  planned tangential whole-breast \nirradiation  and adjuvant systemic therapy  Third-field radiation was prohibited \nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was overall survival with a \nnoninferiority hazard ratio  HR  margin of 1 3  The secondary outcome was disease-free survival \nRESULTS—Among 891 women who were randomized  median age  55 years  856  96%  \ncompleted the trial  446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group  At a median \nfollow-up of 9 3 years  interquartile range  6 93–10 34 years  the 10-year overall survival was \n86 3% in the SLND alone group and 83 6% in the ALND group  HR  0 85 [1-sided 95%CI  0–\n1 16]  noninferiority P =  02  The 10-year disease-free survival was 80 2% in the SLND alone \ngroup and 78 2% in the ALND group  HR  0 85 [95%CI  0 62–1 17]  P =  32  Between year 5 and \nyear 10  1 regional recurrence was seen in the SLND alone group vs none in the ALND group  \nTen-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast \ncancer  no palpable axillary adenopathy  and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases  \n10-year overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was \nnoninferior to overall survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection  These \nfindings do not support routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population \nbased on 10-year outcomes \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials gov Identifier  NCT00003855\n\nFor more than 100 years  the extent of breast cancer surgery was based on the Halstedian \nconcept of breast cancer as a locoregional disease that spread via the lymphatic system and \nwas cured by resection 1 2 Since then  it has been recognized that breast cancer biology  \nrather than the extent of surgery  is a major risk determinant of

to \n36% in women with no axillary nodal metastases  whereas 68% of patients with sentinel \nnode metastases underwent ALND in 2004 8 Axillary lymph node dissection is an effective \nmethod of maintaining regional control but it is associated with a significant risk of \ncomplications such as lymphedema  numbness  axillary web syndrome  and decreased \nupper-extremity range of motion 6 Changes in the presentation and management of breast \ncancer and the selection of systemic therapy based on tumor biology raised questions \nregarding the necessity of ALND for some patients with sentinel lymph node metastases \n\nThe American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011  ACOSOG Z0011  randomized \nclinical trial was designed to determine whether SLND alone yielded survival outcomes that \nwere noninferior to that obtained with ALND in women with a limited number of sentinel \nnode metastases undergoing breast-conserving surgery and receiving adjuvant whole-breast \nirradiation with adjuvant systemic therapy  The ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for \nClinical Trials in Oncology  Alliance  The trial protocol appears in the Supplement \n\nThe initial study results  reported after a median follow-up of 6 3 years 9 10 demonstrated \nthat the overall survival in patients randomized to SLND alone was no worse than patients \nrandomized to ALND with a noninferiority hazard ratio  HR  margin of 1 3  It also showed \nno statistically significant difference in disease-free survival between patients randomized to \nSLND alone or ALND  and nodal recurrence occurred in fewer than 1% of patients in either \nstudy group \n\nA serious criticism of the study was the relatively short follow-up that may have not detected \nlate death  Breast cancer  particularly hormone receptor–positive breast cancer  is a disease \nwith a long natural history11 12 and a substantial risk of locoregional and systemic relapses \noccurring after 5 years  Patients enrolled in ACOSOG Z0011 reflected the demographics of \npatients with breast cancer in the United States  The majority of patients were \npostmenopausal with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer  raising concern that \nadditional follow-up beyond 6 years was needed to document noninferiority of overall \nsurvival with SLND alone in this node-positive cohort \n\nMethods\nPatient Characteristics\n\nThis multicenter randomized phase 3 trial was registered with the National Cancer Institute \nand approved by the institutional review boards at participating centers  All patients \nprovided written informed consent  Adult women with histologically confirmed invasive \nbreast carcinoma clinically 5 cm or less in size  no palpable adenopathy  and with sentinel \nnodes containing metastatic breast cancer detected without immunohistochemical stains \nwere eligible for participation  The eligibility criteria have been reported 9 10\n\nStudy and Design End Points\nThe study and design end points have been described else-where 9 10 Briefly  after \nstratification based on age  hormone receptor status  and tumor size  patients with 1 or 2 \nsentinel nodes with metastases

was required  other testing was based on \nindividual symptoms or by investigator preference \n\nFollow-up was planned for 10 years  The primary study end point was overall survival  \nwhich was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause  Disease-free \nsurvival  which was defined as the time from randomization to death or first breast cancer \nrecurrence  was a secondary end point along with morbidity and locoregional recurrence  \nLocoregional recurrence was defined as a tumor in the breast or in ipsilateral axillary  \ninternal mammary  subclavicular  or supraclavicular nodes  All other disease sites were \ndefined as distant metastases  Secondary end points have been reported 6 13\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe primary end point was overall survival as a measure of noninferiority of no further \naxillary-specified interventions  SLND alone group  compared with the ALND group  The \nstudy design hypothesized that overall survival would be 80% at 5 years for optimally \ntreated women in this node-positive cohort  The SLND alone group would be considered \nclinically noninferior to the ALND group if the 5-year survival rate was 75% or greater and \nthe HR was 1 3 or less  A 1-sided 95% CI for the HR from a Cox regression model was used \nto confirm noninferiority of SLND alone compared with ALND  An estimated 500 deaths \nwere needed for the study to have 90% power 14\n\nEnrollment of 1900 patients in 4 years with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years was \ninitially planned  The trial closed early because of low accrual rates and fewer than \nanticipated events  The protocol specified that patients were to be followed up for a \nminimum of 10 years  However  the analysis of overall survival after the completion of study \nfollow-up was not prespecified \n\nAnalyses were performed on the intent-to-treat sample  436 patients in the SLND alone \ngroup and 420 patients in the ALND group  as well as on the patients who actually received \ntreatment  Both analyses yielded similar results so only the intent-to-treat results are \nreported  Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were compared using the log-\nrank test for noninferiority  The unadjusted HR  95% CI  was calculated using a Cox \nregression analysis  Patients who were lost to follow-up  ie  missing data  were censored at \nthe time of their last follow-up in the time-to-event analyses  disease-free survival and \noverall survival  Most patients were lost to follow-up because the site investigator left an \ninstitution and the institution stopped active follow-up on the patients  Hence  the missing \ndata were not associated with outcome \n\nPatients who withdrew consent for use of their information were omitted from the analyses  \nAll secondary analyses were tested for differences  As a secondary analysis  known \nprognostic factors  including adjuvant treatment  were included in the Cox regression model \nto generate an adjusted HR for overall survival  Disease-free survival was analyzed with a \nlog-rank analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and unadjusted and multivariable Cox \n\nGiuliano et al  Page 4\n\nJAMA

\nthe SLND alone group and 59 in the ALND group  Compared with ALND  SLND alone \nwas found to be noninferior for overall survival  log-rank P =  02  Figure 2A  The 10-year \noverall survival rate was 86 3%  95% CI  82 2%–89 5%  in the SLND alone group and \n83 6%  95% CI  79 1%–87 1%  in the ALND group  The unadjusted HR comparing overall \nsurvival between the SLND alone group and the ALND group

significant difference in overall survival \namong the 4 groups  log-rank P =  14  Figure 2B  Operation had no significant effect on \noverall survival with respect to estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status \n\nDisease-Free Survival\nDisease-free survival and locoregional recurrence have been reported 13 The 10-year \ndisease-free survival was 80 2% 95% CI  75 6%–84 1%  for the SLND alone group and \n78 2%  95% CI  73 5%–82 2%  for the ALND group  log-rank P =  32  Figure 2C  The \nunadjusted HR comparing the SLND alone group with the ALND group was 0 85  95% CI  \n0 62–1 17   Table 2  Only 1 nodal recurrence was observed in a patient in the SLND alone \ngroup after 5 years and none in the ALND group  In an unplanned analysis of the subset of \nthe 228 patients with detailed radiation records available  those treated with nodal-field \nirradiation experienced no difference in disease-free survival  overall survival  or \nlocoregional recurrence compared with those who did not receive irradiation \n\nDiscussion\nEven with follow-up extended to a median of 9 3 years  the ACOSOG Z0011  Alliance  \nrandomized clinical trial demonstrated that SLND alone did not result in inferior overall \nsurvival outcomes compared with ALND for patients with clinical T1 or T2 node-negative \n by palpation  breast cancer and 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes treated with breast-conserving \ntherapy and adjuvant systemic therapy  Before publication of the initial ACOSOG Z0011 \ntrial results 9 there was a general consensus that axillary dissection was necessary for better \ncancer control when metastases were identified in sentinel lymph nodes \n\nAxillary dissections are associated with considerable morbidity  and the results of this trial \ndemonstrated that this morbidity can be avoided without decreasing cancer control  The \nlong-term outcome of this study provides additional support that axillary dissection is not \n\nGiuliano et al  Page 6\n\nJAMA

long-term disease control and survival for patients with positive sentinel \nnodes  even for those with generally late-recurring hormone receptor–positive tumors \n\nIn addition  there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients \ntreated with SLND alone and ALND  This confirms that although distant recurrence among \nhormone receptor–positive tumors is a later event  nodal recurrence among these patients is \nprimarily an early event  The stability of these results over time is important because patients \nwith hormone receptor–positive breast cancer  who comprise the majority of study \nparticipants and the majority of breast cancer patients in the United States  are known to be \nat prolonged risk for disease recurrence \n\nAlthough the annual rate of distant recurrence after completion of 5 years of endocrine \ntherapy has been reported to range from 0 9% to 1 5% through year 15 after diagnosis 12 \nregional recurrence in the ACOSOG Z0011  Alliance  trial was rare after either SLND alone \nor ALND between years 5 and 10 even though more than 80% of patients had hormone \nreceptor–positive tumors 13 These findings are compatible with those of the International \nBreast Cancer Study Group in which rates of regional recurrence in patients with estrogen \nreceptor–positive tumors were seen to increase minimally from 5% to 6 2% between years 5 \nand 10  with substantially greater increases in the rates of late local  8 8%–11 2%  and \ndistant recurrence  23 4%–31 9%  observed 16\n\nBecause the patient characteristics were well balanced  any decrease in disease-free survival \nor overall survival in the SLND alone group would have been anticipated to occur due to an \nincrease in regional recurrences  however  only a single regional recurrence was observed in \nthe SLND alone group with additional follow-up in the ACOSOG Z0011  Alliance  trial  \nConsistent with this finding  the incremental decreases in disease-free survival  3 7% for the \nSLND alone group and 4 0% for the ALND group  and overall survival  6 2% for the SLND \nalone group and 8 2% for the ALND group  between years 5 and 10 among patients \nundergoing either SLND alone or ALND were not meaningfully different  In an adjusted \nanalysis  well documented prognostic factors such as age  hormone receptor status  tumor \nsize  and the use of adjuvant therapy  but not elimination of ALND  were associated with \noverall survival \n\nAlthough the initial results of the ACOSOG Z0011 study generated controversy 17 18 \n\nmanagement of women in the United States with sentinel node metastases changed \nsubstantially as a result of the study  Among 701 consecutive patients with node-positive \ntumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who met ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility \ncriteria  83% did not have to undergo ALND 19 In a 12-hospital network  use of ALND \ndecreased from 71% to 17% after development of a guideline using ACOSOG Z0011 \neligibility criteria and age of 50 years or older as indications for SLND alone 20\n\nIn a National Cancer Database study of 74 309 patients  Yao et al21 observed that use of \nSLND in patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria increased from 23% to 56% \nbetween 2009 and 2011  In that study  age younger than 50 years and a triple-negative \nsubtype predicted a greater use of ALND  a practice neither supported by the reported 5-year \noutcomes of ACOSOG Z0011 9 nor by the findings of the current report  In ACOSOG \n\nGiuliano et al  Page 7\n\nJAMA  Author manuscript

associated with locoregional recurrence after controlling \nfor other factors 13 Studies examining the application of findings from ACOSOG Z0011 \namong young women or among those with triple-negative breast cancer have found neither a \ngreater need for ALND in these groups  nor heavier axillary tumor burdens in those \nundergoing ALND 19 22\n\nThe role of nodal irradiation  specifically in ACOSOG Z0011 and in the management of \npatients with node-positive breast cancer  is controversial  Although 19% of patients \nreceived prohibited third-field irradiation  nodal irradiation was distributed similarly by \ntreatment group  as was omission of irradiation and the use of high–tangent-field \nirradiation 15 indicating that choice of radiotherapy fields was unlikely to have affected the \nstudy outcome  In addition  the unplanned analysis showed that no survival differences were \nobserved among patients treated with conventional tangent-field irradiation or nodal-field \nirradiation \n\nSince the initial publication of ACOSOG Z0011 9 2 studies  the MA 2023 and the European \nOrganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer24 [EORTC] 22922/10925  examined the \nrole of regional nodal irradiation in patients with similar characteristics  T1 or T2 and 1  2  \nor 3 axillary nodal metastases  and their findings have caused some25 to question whether \ncomprehensive nodal irradiation should be routine  In the MA 20 study 23 patients with \nnode-positive tumors were randomized to axillary dissection or axillary dissection plus \nextensive postoperative nodal irradiation  including supraclavicular and internal mammary \nnodal basins  The EORTC 22922/10925 study24 randomized high-risk women \npostoperatively to whole-breast or chest-wall irradiation alone or with regional nodal \nirradiation  These studies  with 10 years of follow-up and 5836 enrolled patients  \ndemonstrate a very modest 1% to 1 5% decrease in regional recurrence with nodal \nirradiation  and no significant difference in overall survival \n\nThe 10-year rates of overall survival in the SLND alone and ALND groups of the ACOSOG \nZ0011  Alliance  trial were 86 3% and 83 6%  respectively  compared with 82 8% in the \nnodal irradiation group in MA 20 and 82 3% in EORTC 22922/10925  suggesting that the \nACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria identified a population that may not benefit from \ncomprehensive nodal irradiation  Thus  although nodal irradiation may be added to the \nmanagement of some patients with node-positive tumors based on an evaluation of their \noverall risk profile  the routine use of nodal irradiation for all patients with 1 or 2 sentinel \nnode metastases managed with SLND alone may not be justified \n\nTen years of follow-up confirm that women with 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes and clinical \nT1 or T2 tumors undergoing lumpectomy with whole-breast irradiation and systemic therapy \nexperience no worse local control  disease-free survival  or overall survival with elimination \nof ALND  Application of these findings in clinical practice has the potential to avoid the \nmorbidity of ALND without diminution of survival outcomes in 61% to 83% of women with \nthese characteristics 19 26 The routine use of ALND for all patients with positive sentinel \nnodes is no longer justified based on these 10-year overall survival results \n\nGiuliano et

M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\nHowever  these conclusions apply only to patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility \ncriteria and should not be extrapolated to the management of patients with positive palpable \nnodes  those with metastases in more than 2 sentinel nodes  patients forgoing whole-breast \nirradiation  those treated with mastectomy without radiation  or patients receiving \nneoadjuvant therapy because all of these are circumstances in which the elimination of \nALND is not known to be safe  The ongoing Positive Sentinel Node-Adjuvant Therapy \nAlone vs Adjuvant Therapy Plus Clearance or Axillary Radiotherapy trial for women with \nmetastases in 1 or 2 sentinel nodes treated with breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy \nwill provide important information about the safety of omitting ALND after mastectomy  but \nthis study is not expected to complete accrual until 2018 17\n\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations  Like most large randomized trials in breast cancer \nmanagement  not all biological subtypes are represented in large numbers  Differences in \noutcomes may be seen for patients with different individual circumstances  However  not all \nbiological subtypes can be analyzed for small variations in locoregional treatment  \nFurthermore  due to low accrual and the low event rate  the study did not reach the \nprespecified sample size of 1900 participants or 500 deaths  In addition  some patients had \nirradiation protocol variations that could have resulted in a small alteration of outcomes  \nhowever  these patients were distributed similarly in both study groups \n\nConclusions\nAmong women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer  no palpable axillary \nadenopathy  and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases  10-year overall survival \nfor patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall \nsurvival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection  These findings do not support \nroutine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population based on 10-year \noutcomes \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for

efficacy of paclitaxel\ntherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer  We performed a retrospective analysis\nassessing whether the early occurrence of peripheral neuropathy  EPN  was a predictive\nmarker for better efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy\ncontaining paclitaxel \n\nPatients and methods\nBetween January 2000 and August 2008  we examined the records of 168 patients with\nmetastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel in our hospital  EPN was defined as a symp-\ntom of Grade 2 or more during first three months of treatment  The overall response rate\n ORR  and time to treatment failure  TTF  in each group were analyzed retrospectively \n\nResults\nOf 168 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with paclitaxel  EPN was\ndocumented in 101 patients  60 1%  The clinical benefit rate  CR  PR  and SD  6 months \nwas 72 3% in the EPN group and 49 3% in the non-EPN group  p = 0 002  The TTF of the\nEPN group  median 11 2 months  95% CI  9 5–12 9  was significantly longer than that of\nthe non-EPN group  5 7 months  95% CI  4 6–6 8   p 6 months  Time to treatment failure  TTF  was used\n\nas the surrogate marker for the efficacy of paclitaxel  TTF was defined as time interval from the\n\nstart of paclitaxel treatment to disease progression or cessation of treatment because of adverse\n\nevents  SPSS ver  17 0 was used for statistical analysis in this study  ORR and CBR were ana-\n\nlyzed using the χ2 test  TTF was measured by the log-rank test using the Kaplan-Meier method \nFor multivariate analysis  Cox regression analysis was used  A p-value of less than 0 05 was\n\nconsidered statistically significant \n\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nCharacteristics of all 168 patients are listed in Table 1  All evaluated cases had invasive breast\n\ncancer  The median age was 56 years  29–84  Patient numbers according to age group age\n\nwere as follows   40 years old  148 patients  88 1%  The\n\nmost common sites of distant metastasis were the lymph nodes  found in 102 patients  60 7% \n\nThe mean number of metastases was three  The number of patients receiving one or more\n\nprior treatment was 132  78 6%  72 patients  42 9%  had a history of receiving anthracyclines \n\nEarly onset of peripheral neuropathy and clinicopathological features of\neach group\nIn our study  EPN appeared in 101 patients  60 1%  Associations between EPN and the distri-\n\nbution of clinicopathological features are shown in Table 1  Although there was significant dif-\n\nference between age among two groups  there was no important differences between subtype\n\ndistribution  portions of metastasis  number of prior chemotherapy treatments  or history of\n\nanthracycline and microtubule agents \n\nCumulative dose\nCumulative dose of all 168 patients are shown in Table 2  Median cumulative dose was 1720 0\n\nmg/m2 in all patients  Median cumulative dose was 1120 0 mg/m2 in the non-EPN group and\n\n1920 0 mg/m2 in the EPN group  p  6 months  PD  progressive disease  ORR  overall response rate  CBR  clinical benefit rate \n\nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0184322

11\n\n\n\n\n\nwide range  Further investigation was required to identify the predictive markers associated\n\nwith taxane therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer  according to subtype \n\nIn paclitaxel therapy  the main adverse events that disturb treatment include paclitaxel-\n\nassociated peripheral neuropathy  The mechanism of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy is\n\nrelated to the presence of disrupted microtubules of the mitotic spindle  This disruption inter-\n\nferes with axonal transport and macrophage activation in both the dorsal root ganglia and\n\nperipheral nerve  as well as with microglial activation within the spinal cord [6  7  8]  More-\n\nover  taxane induced a dying-back process starting from distal nerve endings followed by\n\neffects on Schwann cells and other neuronal cells  which is an essential microtubule-based pro-\n\ncess that moves cellular components over long distances between neuronal cell bodies and\n\nnerve terminals [7] \n\nPeripheral neuropathy may be of interest in predicting the efficacy of paclitaxel therapy for\n\nbreast cancer patients  In the ECOG 1199 study  the development of neuropathy was found\n\nnot to be predictive of survival outcome for patients with early operable breast cancer who had\n\nreceived adjuvant taxane therapy [9]  There has been no previous report showing the develop-\n\nment of neuropathy to be predictive of survival outcomes in metastatic breast cancer  How-\n\never  we revealed in this study that EPN occurred in 101 patients  60 1%  and that the early\n\nFig 1  Kaplan-Meier plots for TTF  The TTF of the EPN group  median 11 2 months  95% CI  9 15–12 9  was\nsignificantly longer than that of the non-EPN group  5 7 months  95% CI  4 6–6 8  in all patients

1371/journal pone 0184322 September 12  2017 7 / 11\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopment of peripheral neuropathy strongly associated with prolongation of TTF in patients\n\nwith metastatic breast cancer  The overall incidence of peripheral neuropathy is similar to that\n\npreviously reported in phase III studies in patients with MBC and to other published retrospec-\n\ntive studies  which ranges from 18–83% [10] \n\nPossible causes of the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy of paclitaxel associated with strong\n\npredictor for prolongation of TTF in patients with metastatic breast cancer include the following\n\nfactors  Peripheral neuropathy  a dose-dependent adverse event  is a major toxicity associated\n\nwith paclitaxel  The predominant risk factor for peripheral neuropathy is the cumulative dose\n\nover time [11]  Moreover  Mielke S et al reported that there is an obvious mechanism for this\n\nassociation  It is well established that higher drug concentrations  a longer duration of systemic\n\nconcentration above a threshold of 0 05 uM  were associated with greater neuropathy [12]  They\n\nalso revealed that the effects of time above paclitaxel concentrations of 0 05 micromol/l was asso-\n\nciated with response to treatment  and this emphasizes the value of threshold models for the\n\nFig 2  Kaplan-Meier plots for TTF according to subtypes  Among the four subtypes  TTF was 10 0 months in the EPN group and\n3 7 months in the non-EPN group in the luminal type  p =  70% vs ≦70% 1 532–3 231  1vs≦1 0 926–1 905 0 120\n\nHistory of microtubule agents 2 337\nyes vs no

presence of iron in tumor and metastasis-associated macrophages is not\nknown  Here we mapped and quantified hemosiderin-laden macrophage  HLM  deposits in\nmurine models of metastatic breast cancer using iron and macrophage histology  and in\nvivo MRI  Iron MRI detected high-iron pixel clusters in mammary tumors  lung metastasis \nand brain metastasis as well as liver and spleen tissue known to contain the HLMs  Iron his-\ntology showed these regions to contain clustered macrophages identified by their common\niron status and tissue-intrinsic association with other phenotypic macrophage markers  The\nin vivo MRI and ex vivo histological images were further processed to determine the fre-\nquencies and sizes of the iron deposits  and measure the number of HLMs in each deposit\nto estimate the in vivo MRI sensitivity for these cells  Hemosiderin accumulation is a macro-\nphage biomarker and intrinsic contrast source for cellular MRI associated with the innate\nfunction of macrophages in iron metabolism systemically  and in metastatic cancer \n\nIntroduction\nMacrophage accumulation is an emerging hallmark of the breast tumor and metastasis micro-\n\nenvironment [1–4]  At early stages of neoplasia  macrophages mount inflammatory response\n\nto initial tumor proliferation  and at later stages these macrophages adopt pro-tumor pheno-\n\ntypes associated with angiogenesis  metastatic dissemination  and immune-suppression [5  6] \n\nHistological evaluation of cells stained for macrophage surface receptor markers such as CD68\n\ncan provide a score of immune cell accumulation  or infiltration  that has been correlated with\n\ndisease stage [7–12]  and can also provide predictive information on expected outcomes of\n\ntherapeutic intervention [13]  These assessments of tumor-associated macrophages  TAMs \n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0184765 September 12  2017 1 /

 or sampling of lesions following bulk surgi-\n\ncal resection  Collection of these specimens is routine  but invasive in primary breast tumors \n\nand it becomes increasingly difficult to assess metastasis-associated macrophages  MAMs  in\n\nmetastatic sites such as the lung and brain  Therefore  alternative non-invasive translational\n\ntechniques are required that enable imaging and characterization of TAMs in vivo \n\nMacrophages function to recycle iron from senescent erythrocytes and have evolved to\n\nsequester the salvaged iron collected while mounting their innate immune response to tissue\n\ninsult and pathogens [14–16]  To package their iron cargo  macrophages accumulate it in crys-\n\ntalline ferritin granule aggregates called hemosiderin \n\nSo-called hemosiderin-laden macrophages  HLMs  also confer high MRI contrast and have\n\nlong been used to detect macrophages preclinically and clinically [17–20]  Additionally  clini-\n\ncal MRI protocols have been developed that are sensitive to these cellular iron deposits [21 \n\n22]  and are similar to those utilized currently as standard-of-care breast tumor detection\n\nmethods [23] suggesting that simultaneous tumor and HLM imaging can be performed \n\nAs iron metabolism is a major area of research in breast and other cancers [24–28]  but the\n\nassociation of hemosiderin deposits in tumor and metastasis has been relatively unexplored \n\nwe sought to determine the extent to which iron deposition occurs in the breast tumor and\n\nmetastasis microenvironment  and evaluate our ability to map these deposits histologically and\n\nin vivo by MRI  We found that hemosiderin iron is indeed a metabolic biomarker of a popula-\n\ntion of macrophage deposits  and that the association of these iron III + CD68+ macrophages\n\nwith pro-inflammatory  allograft inflammatory factor-1 AIF1  and anti-inflammatory  man-\n\nnose receptor  CD206  subsets varies according to tissue type  The association between hemo-\n\nsiderin and macrophages also provided a way to detect deposits of these cells in vivo by iron\n\nMRI with cellular level sensitivity  Using image feature detection algorithms we measured the\n\nfrequency and size of the deposits in the iron MRI and histology  These findings show that\n\niron deposition defines a metabolically distinct subset of immune infiltrates in tumors and\n\nmetastasis  and provides an in vivo means to map and quantify the size of the deposits accord-\n\ning to their innate iron status \n\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal procedures\nAll animal work

use of iron MRI in mapping HLM deposi-\n\ntion in brain metastasis with cellular sensitivity \n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe association of iron deposits with macrophages underscores their metabolic role in recy-\n\ncling iron for heme biosynthesis  The function of macrophages in storing iron is highlighted in\n\nthe livers and spleens  organs known to harbor HLMs and are central to iron homeostasis \n\nHere  iron III + and CD68+ macrophages occurred with similar frequency  and were also asso-\n\nciated with AIF1 and CD206 populations indicating that most of the macrophages were\n\nengaged in iron-handling roles  In mammary tumors  however  iron III + macrophages were\n\nrelatively fewer than in the liver and spleen  and only a fraction of the HLMs were associated\n\nwith the total CD68+  AIF1+  and CD206+ macrophages also found in the mammary tumors \n\nSimilarly  in lung and brain metastases  HLM populations were even more rare  presumably\n\nbecause of the restrictive cellular barriers  blood-brain/lung  that limit deposition of immune\n\ncells and erythrocytes  and thus limits accumulation of iron in macrophages in these organs\n\n[40–42]  These observations indicate that while the iron deposition in tumor and metastasis\n\nassociated macrophages is not as prominent as in organs such as the spleen and liver  iron stor-\n\nage in hemosiderin is an important conserved function for macrophages in both those iron-\n\nhandling tissues and in the tumor and metastatic microenvironments \n\nIn the innate immune response  resident macrophages and circulating myeloid cells from\n\nbone marrow respond to and transmit cytokine cues signaling inflammatory and anti-inflam-\n\nmatory programs  leading to adaptive signaling and vascular remodeling of the tumor micro-\n\nenvironment [43–45]  In these situations macrophages can change their surface receptor\n\nexpression giving rise to so-called polarization in a given tissue setting [5  46]  The surface\n\nreceptor CD68 is a pan-macrophage marker and is used commonly for both pre-clinical and\n\nclinical assessment of macrophage infiltration  and thus  the majority of our studies relied on\n\nthis marker to evaluate the iron staining in relation to this general macrophage population \n\nWe also assessed the association of the HLMs with other specialized functional markers\n\nincluding AIF1  pro-inflammatory  M1  and CD206  anti-inflammatory  M2  We found that\n\nin mammary tumors  livers  and spleens  iron III + CD68+ HLMs expressed both AIF1 and\n\nCD206 to a similar degree indicating that in these tissues the HLM subpopulations were not\n\npolarized to either phenotypic extreme  In metastasis  however  HLMs were strongly polarized \n\nThe iron+ CD68+ HLMs in lung metastasis exhibited high levels of CD206 not AIF1  and in\n\nbrain iron+ CD68+ HLMs were predominantly associated with high levels of AIF1  not CD206 \n\nInterestingly  this demonstrates that while our imaging investigations identify specific popula-\n\ntions of macrophages according to their hemosiderin deposits in all the tissues studied  the\n\nassociation of the iron-laden macrophage deposits with the phenotypic polarization markers\n\nappears to be related more to the tissue where they are found  rather than the association with\n\niron deposition alone \n\nMapping iron deposit size and frequency provides a new application of iron MRI tech-\n\nniques that enables the localization and quantification of macrophage deposits systemically \n\nand in cancer microenvironments  As the basic iron MRI experiments are commonly per-\n\nformed clinically  and the new spatial image analysis approaches rely on simple cluster map\n\nprocessing procedures  their combination has high translational potential  Applications for the\n\nIron imaging in metastatic breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone

monitoring macrophage depletion using\n\ninjections of clodronate liposomes[49]  or tracking cellular response to administration of mac-\n\nrophage targeted cancer therapies [48  50  51] \n\nThe studies presented here link a hallmark phenotype of macrophages  hemosiderin iron\n\ndeposition  with the presence of infiltrating macrophages in metastatic breast cancer models \n\nand we describe an in vivo approach for the quantitative mapping of these HLM deposits and\n\nmeasurement of their frequency and size  Taken together  imaging macrophages according to\n\ntheir endogenous iron levels reveals a cellular biomarker associated with their innate role in\n\niron metabolism  and bridges a gap in our ability to quantitatively assess macrophage accumu-\n\nlation in vivo \n\nAuthor

complex  4  was more efficient\ninhibiting proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells over non-tumor cells  In addition  complex  4 \nwas able to inhibit MDA-MB231 cells adhesion  migration and invasion and to induce apo-\nptosis and inhibit MMP-9 secretion in TNBC cells  Complex  4  should be further investi-\ngated in vivo in order to stablish its potential to improve breast cancer treatment

well as its toxicity and other side effects  Moreover  the development of chemother-\n\napy resistance is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of many tumors  including breast\n\ncancer [2]  Triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  in which cells do not have estrogen  ER- \n\nprogesterone  PR-  and HER2  HER2-  receptors is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype \n\nresponsible for about 20% of breast cancers  The high rates of metastasis associated to the fact\n\nthat these cells frequently display multidrug resistance make the treatment of its metastatic dis-\n\nease difficult [3  4]  TNBC is treated with a combination of therapies such as surgery  radiation \n\nand chemotherapy  However  the limited efficacy of current systemic and targeted therapies\n\nagainst TNBC tumor metastases leads the search for new types of treatments [5] \n\nCisplatin  oxaliplatin and carboplatin are the only metal-based chemotherapeutic drugs\n\napproved for worldwide clinical practice  They have been used and are effective for the treat-\n\nment of numerous human cancers  However  cisplatin has been reported to cause drug resis-\n\ntance and several undesirable side effects such as allergic reactions  decrease immunity to\n\ninfections  severe kidney problems  gastrointestinal disorders  haemorrhage  and hearing loss\n\n[6]  Ru complexes have emerged as potential candidates to replace platinum chemotherapy \n\nThe Ru complex  known as NAMI-A  imidazolium trans-[tetrachloro dimethylsulfoxide 1H-\nimidazole ruthenate III ]  which was proven to be effective in managing lung cancer metasta-\n\nses is in clinical phase of studies  Currently  a combinatory therapy using NAMI-A and gemci-\n\ntabine is in Phase I/II of clinical trial for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma [7] \n\nThe KP1019  trans-[tetrachlorobis 1H-indazole -ruthenate III ]  is a second Ru-based anti-\ncancer agent to enter to clinical trials and the results of the early clinical development demon-\n\nstrated that five out of six evaluated patients experienced disease stabilization with no severe\n\nside effects [8] \n\nOver the last years  some unique properties of Ru-based complexes were identified  includ-\n\ning the possibility to occupy a high number of spatial positions compared to cisplatin  a high\n\nnumber of potential accessory molecules that can be carried by the drug structure and particu-\n\nlarly  the possibility to exist in the biological fluids in almost all the most important oxidation\n\nstates from II to IV [9]  These characteristics have made Ru-based complexes promising anti-\n\ntumor and antimetastatic candidates  Nevertheless  the underlying mechanisms of the antime-\n\ntastatic potential of Ru-based agents are not completely understood  Thus  in this work we\n\ndescribed the effects of a series of Ru complexes  1  [Ru SO4 dppb bipy ]   2  [Ru CO3 \n\n dppb bipy ]   3  [Ru C2O4 dppb bipy ] and  4  [Ru CH3CO2 dppb bipy ]PF6 [were\n\ndppb = 1 4-bis diphenylphosphino butane and bipy = 2 2’-bipyridine] on the proliferation of\n\nTNBC  MDA-MB-231  ER+  MCF-7  breast tumor cells and non-tumor breast cell line\n\n MCF-10A  These complexes were inspired by the platinum-based anticancer drugs carbopla-\n\ntin  oxaliplatin  nedaplatin and lobaplatin  which have oxygen containing ligands in their\n\nstructures and because the facility of their syntheses  in high yield  with high purity  Also  the\n\ncomplex  4  was introduced in this series mainly because it is a cationic complex  which could\n\nbe more soluble in the biological medium \n\nTherefore  the aim of this work was to investigate the effects of the newly synthesized Ru\n\ncomplexes on different types of breast tumor cells and  after identifying the more cytotoxic\n\ncomplex  to further investigate its effects on cell adhesion  migration  invasion  induction of\n\napoptosis and interaction with DNA and HSA in TNBC cells  Complex  4  demonstrated the\n\nlowest IC50 inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and also  to be effective inhibiting cell\n\nadhesion  migration and invasion and inducing apoptosis of this TNBC cell line  Complex  4 \n\nwas able to bind DNA and HSA with low to moderate intensity  but even so  it was capable to\n\ninduce conformational changes on the DNA molecule \n\nEffects of a new ruthenium complex on breast

studies with HSA\nFor fluorescence measurements  the HSA concentration in Tris–HCl buffer was kept constant\n\nin all the samples  while the complex concentration was increased from 0 50 to 50 μM  and\nquenching of the emission intensity of the HSA tryptophan residues at 305 nm  excitation\n\nwavelength 270 nm  was monitored at different temperatures  25˚C and 37˚C  The experi-\n\nments were carried out in triplicate and analysed using the classical Stern-Volmer equation \n\nThe binding constant  Kb  and number of complexes bound to HSA  n  were determined by\n\nplotting the double log graph of the fluorescence data using  log [ F0-F /F] = log Kb + nlog[Q] \n\nThe thermodynamic parameter  ΔH  was calculated from equation  ln  K2/K1  = [ 1/T1 - 1/\nT2 ]ΔH/R  where K1 and K2 are the binding constants at temperatures T1 and T2  and R is the\ngas constant  Furthermore  the change in free energy  ΔG  and entropy  ΔS  were calculated\nfrom the following equation  ΔG = -RT lnK = ΔH − TΔS \n\nSpectroscopic measurements\nAll measurements with ct-DNA  calf thymus DNA  were carried out in Tris-HCl buffer  The\nspectroscopic titrations were carried out by adding increasing amounts of

TBE \n\nand stained with ethidium bromide  2 mL ethidium bromide per 40 mL agarose gel mixture \n\nSamples of DNA with DMSO were used as controls  The DNA bands were visualized as an\n\nimage using a UV light transilluminator  ChemiDoc MP  BioRad Laboratories \n\nStatistical analysis\nEach experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and a standard error mean was calcu-\n\nlated  Shapiro-Wilk’s test was used to verify data normality  As normal distribution was pres-\n\nent  the results were compared statistically with a one-way or two-way analysis of variance\n\n ANOVA  Since the ANOVA tests showed significant differences  acceptable p level   300 μM  and human normal kidney HK2 cells  IC50 110 3 μM  This could indicate\nspecificity of the complexes  to affect tumor cells  but not normal cells’ viability \n\nColony formation assay is an in vitro cell survival assay based on the ability of a single cell\nto grow into a colony  This is a method of choice to determine cell reproductive death after\n\ntreatment with ionizing radiation  but can also be used to determine the effectiveness of other\n\ncytotoxic agents [23]  The results show that the complex  4  at concentrations of 2 5  5  10 and\n\n20 μM significantly inhibited the colony number and size in MDA-MB-231 cells  compared to\nuntreated control cells  acting therefore as a cytotoxic and cytostatic agent  The highest con-\n\ncentration  20 μM  completely abolished the capacity of breast tumor cells to form colonies\n Fig 2B \n\nThese findings can be explained by the lipophilicity of the complexes  Table 1  The parti-\n\ntion coefficient between water or buffer and n-octanol is the most widely used measure of\n\nchemical compound lipophilicity [24] since it is a major structural factor governing both phar-\n\nmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs  The higher cytotoxicity for complex  4  can be\n\nassociated with its higher log P  suggesting that the hydrophobicity increases its biological\nactivity  The low cytotoxicity for complexes  1–3  could be explained by their low log P  com-\npared to the lipophilicity of complex  4 \n\nCell migration and

wound\n\nhealing assays demonstrated that complex  4  inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration in a con-\n\ncentration dependent fashion  Fig 3A and 3B  One important characteristic of metastatic\n\ntumor is its ability to invade adjacent tissues  Compound  4  at concentration of 20 μM was\nable to inhibit the invasion MDA-MB-231 cells in approximately 80% compared to control\n\n Fig 3C \n\nThe invasion of tumor cells is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases  MMPs  such as\n\nMMP-2 and MMP-9  MMPs have a potential in ECM degradation and this correlates with the\n\nlate stages of tumor invasion and metastasis [26]  The effects caused by the incubation of\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells with complex  4  on the activity of MMP-9 were accessed by zymography\n\nassay electrophoresis gel containing gelatin  Fig 3D  Complex  4  at concentrations 2 5  5 and\n\n10 μM did not inhibit the expression of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells  On the other hand \nhigher concentrations  20 μM  inhibited by 60% the expression of MMP-9 when compared to\nthe untreated control  Fig 3D  It is important to point out that the effects of complex  4  were\n\nrelated to cell migration and invasion rather than to cell death  since all concentrations tested\n\nFig 3  Effects of complex  4  on MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion   A  Complex was incubated\nwith MDA-MB-231 and cells were allowed to migrate in

complexes suggests a moderate interac-\n\ntion with HSA molecule [38] \n\nOverall  there are little studies comparing the effects of Ru complexes on tumor and non-\n\ntumor cell lines  for a review  see [39]  In general  in the present study we demonstrated that\n\ncomplex  4  was able to inhibit cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells  at concentrations as\n\nlow as 5μM  In addition  complex  4  inhibited TNBC cell adhesion to different ECM compo-\nnents and this effect was mediated  at least partially  due to its interference with actin cytoskel-\n\neton  Other Ru complexes were able to interfere with cell migration  invasion and adhesion\n\nprocesses in tumor cells  at concentrations ranging from 0 75μM to 4μM  depending on the\nassay [39]  Complex  4  induced apoptosis in TNBC cells  as demonstrated in our study by\n\nflow cytometry  DAPI staining  RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses at concentrations\n\nfrom 2 5μM  Several other studies demonstrated that Ru complexes induce apoptosis on\nTNBC cells  through different mechanisms  To give few examples  co-treatment cells with\n\nRuPOP and TRAIL effectively triggered apoptosis through the activation of caspases-3/-8/-9\n\nand cleaved PARP in MDA-MB-231 cells at concentrations as low as 2μM [40]  In contrast \nZeng and co-workers [41] found that 40μM of Λ-RM0627 exhibited little apoptosis inducing\neffect on MDA-MB-231 cells  with only 6 2% cells in the late stage and 21 8% cells in the early\n\nstage of apoptosis \n\nConclusions\nTaken together  the results show that complex  4  is more lipophilic and cytotoxic than com-\n\nplexes  1–3  Complex  4  is able to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation  adhesion  migra-\n\ntion and invasion  Furthermore  complex  4  modifies the structure of the actin cytoskeleton \n\nbinds to DNA  inducing apoptosis and inhibits MMP-9 secretion in this cell line  This work\n\nsupports the evidence that complex  4  should be further studied in order to explore its poten-\n\ntial of action using in vivo models  which may contribute to the development of a new antitu-\nmor drug to be applied in chemotherapy \n\nSupporting information\nS1

cancer \ncells traversing the basement membrane of the epithelium \nof origin  followed by migration through the peritumoral \nstroma until they enter blood vessels  circulate and seed at \ndistant sites [1–3]  In epithelial cancers  invasion and meta-\nstatic progression can proceed by distinct cellular mecha-\nnisms  including single-cell and collective invasion [4–6]  \nIn mouse models for breast cancer in vivo both individual \nand clustered circulating tumor cells  CTCs  can be iso-\nlated from peripheral blood and both are able to colonize \ndistant organs [6  7]  Likewise  individual and clustered \nCTCs are present in the peripheral blood of stage IV breast \ncancer patients [7]  Whereas the relevance and mechanisms \nof collective invasion and metastasis are being uncovered \nin mouse models  the prevalence of collective invasion in \n\nAbstract Breast cancer undergoes collective tissue inva-\nsion and  in experimental models  can collectively metas-\ntasize  The prevalence of collective invasion and its con-\ntribution to distant metastasis in clinical disease  however  \nremains poorly defined  We here scored the adipose tis-\nsue invasion of primary invasive ductal carcinoma  IDC  \nexpressing E-cadherin  and E-cadherin negative invasive \nlobular carcinoma  ILC  and identified predominantly col-\nlective invasion patterns  86/86 samples  in both carcinoma \ntypes  Whereas collective invasion in IDC lesions retained \nadherens junctions  multicellular clusters and “Indian files” \nin ILC  despite the absence of adherens junctions  AJ  pro-\nteins E-cadherin and β-catenin  retained CD44 at cell–cell \ncontacts  By histomorphological scoring and semi-auto-\nmated image analysis  we show that the extent of collective \ninvasion into

the extent of collective \ninvasion correlates with metastatic progression  remain \nunexplored \n\nWhether cells move individually or collectively is defined \nby the molecular organization and stability of cell–cell junc-\ntions [8]  Individual cell invasion results from the down-\nregulation of cell–cell junctions in response to activation \nsignals  e g  as part of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition \n EMT  whereas collective invasion and metastasis critically \ndepend upon intact junctions between cancer cells  particu-\nlarly adherens junctions  AJ  and desmosomal adhesions [8  \n9]  In mouse models for invasive ductal carcinoma  IDC  \nand 3D analysis of selected human IDC samples  multicel-\nlular invasion is associated with E-cadherin expression along \ncell–cell junctions  whereby partial E-cadherin downregula-\ntion and upregulation of EMT markers were noted in small \nsubregions of collective invasion [10  11]  This indicates \nmolecular variability of collectively invading cancers \n\nDespite its emerging relevance for tissue penetration \nand metastasis  a topologic and molecular classification of \ncollective invasion in clinical breast cancer  its molecular \nsubtypes and prevalence is missing  Using quantitaive 2D \nand 3D image cytometry in a retrospective cohort of 111 \nclinical breast cancer samples  we here derive the prevalence \nof collective invasion in IDC and ILC lesions and its asso-\nciation with metastasis  We show that collective invasion  \nirrespective of E-cadherin expression  is the default inva-\nsion

expressed as the percentage of all pan-cytoker-\natin positive cells in the invasion zone \n\nTo determine whether collective invasion correlates with \ndistant metastasis  the extent of collective invasion within \nthe marginal adipose tissue was scored and correlated with \nthe metastasis-free survival  Of the tissue blocks that con-\ntained adipose tissue  N = 102  the majority showed adipose \ntissue invasion  N = 86  The extent of such collective inva-\nsion was determined by a board-certified breast pathologist \n P B  in a blinded fashion from samples stained by anti-\nE-cadherin antibody and hematoxylin using bright-field \nmicroscopy  Cancer cells were identified by their typical \nhistopathological features  including large and irregular-\nshaped nuclei  invasive growth pattern and  for IDC lesions  \nE-cadherin positivity  A histopathological collective inva-\nsion  CI  score was obtained using the following formula \n\nFirst  the percentage of adipose tissue content in the \nwhole section was determined by estimating the propor-\ntion of the adipocyte-rich regions relative to the total area \nof the tissue section  including tumor  fibrous and adipose \ntissue  The percentage of adipose tissue per sample was \ncomparable in both patient subsets with or without distant \nmetastasis  Supplementary Fig  3a  This precludes selection \nbias originating from uneven representation of the stromal \ncompartment \n\nThen  the area occupied by the tumor cell invasion zone \nlocated within the adipose tissue was estimated as percent-\nage of the total tumor area present in each slide  As an exam-\nple  10% invading tumor cells located within the adipose \ntissue indicates that the other 90% of the tumor cells in this \nslice were located within the fibrous tissue or  non-invading  \nin the tumor core  The CI score was then obtained as the \nratio of the percentage of cancer cells occupying the fat tis-\nsue relative to the total adipose tissue area per sample \n\nQuantification of collective invasion by semi‑automated \nimage analysis\n\nTo validate histopathological scoring results  quantitative \ncytometry was performed on all E-cadherin

\nhyaluronan-mediated cell–cell interactions such as between \nkeratinocytes [18] and between endothelial cells and T-cells \n[19]  We here used CD44 as a marker with stable cell sur-\nface

stromal fibroblasts [20] or further \nmay represent cancer cells that have undergone complete \nEMT [21]  These results indicate that multicellular groups \nin both IDC and ILC retain epithelial characteristics and lack \ntraits of complete EMT \n\nAssociation of collective cancer invasion and distant \nmetastasis\n\nTo address the extent of collective invasion two comple-\nmentary strategies were used  The areas of the marginal \nadipose tissue occupied by collective invasion fronts were \nhistomorphologically scored by a breast cancer pathologist \nand compared for patient subsets with  n = 44  or without \n n = 58  distant metastasis within 5 years of follow-up \n\nIn addition  for IDC samples  the histomorphological \nscore for collective invasion was validated by semi-auto-\nmated quantification of collective invasion  using E-cadherin \nas reference marker for the invasion zone  The CI scores \nobtained by both strategies showed strong positive correla-\ntion  Supplementary Fig  3b  indicating comparable preci-\nsion for quantifying epithelial collective invasion  Both scor-\ning approaches revealed that the extent of collective invasion \ninto the adipose tissue correlated positively with distant \nmetastasis  Fig  3a  b  Consistently  distant metastasis-free \nsurvival was significantly reduced in patients with high CI \nscores  Fig  3c  Supplementary Fig  3c  with respective haz-\nard ratios of 2 32 and 2 29 using histomorphological scoring \nand segmentation-based analysis  The CI score neither cor-\nrelated with lymph node metastasis  tumor grade  tumor size \nor menopausal status  Supplementary Fig  3d  Thus  the \nextent of collective invasion in the marginal adipose tissue is \nassociated with metastasis outcome in breast cancer patients \n\nDiscussion\n\nUsing cell–cell adhesion markers as basic criteria for collec-\ntive migration [8]  we here identified collective invasion as \nthe predominating strategy for local tissue infiltration in pri-\nmary breast cancer  irrespective of the histological subtype \nand E-cadherin status  The association of collective adipose \ntissue invasion with metastatic disease suggests an important \nrole for cell–cell cooperation in systemic dissemination \n\nCollective invasion with and without adherens junctions\n\nIn moving epithelia  stable cell–cell junctions maintained \nby E-cadherin are critical in mediating multicellular coor-\ndination and polarity  mechanotransduction and movement \n[6  22]  Here  we could discriminate at least two types of \ncollective invasion using cytokeratin as an epithelial identi-\nfier together with AJ markers and vimentin as EMT and stro-\nmal marker   i  E-cadherin positive and vimentin-negative \n\nFig  3  Correlation of collective

and arguably more \nloose files in ILC  which retain cell–cell interactions but lack \nboth E-cadherin and vimentin  In IDC  all lesions and  per \nlesion  the vast majority of cells retain E-cadherin expres-\nsion  consistent with collective epithelial invasion [8]  The \ninvasive patterns in ILC  although predominantly collec-\ntive  show higher probability of cell individualization than \nin IDC  This suggests that both collective and single-cell \ninvasion occur in parallel in ILC and may provide a broader \nrange of metastatic phenotypes  In ILC  CD44 was used \nto visualize regions of overlapping membrane staining in \njuxtaposed cells  The pattern of CD44-positive cell–cell \ninteractions in ILC is consistent with an experimental ILC \nmouse model after somatic inactivation of the E-cadherin \ngene  where invading cells retain multicellular organization \ninstead of disseminating individually [23]  Whether CD44 \nmediates cell–cell adhesion during collective invasion of \nILC or rather acts as functionally inert marker for cell–cell \ninteractions remains to be clarified  Both CD44 and hyalu-\nronic acid are expressed in breast cancer cells  thus CD44 \ncould potentially engage to hyaluronic acid present at the \ncounterpart membrane of the contacted cell [24]  In T cells  \nCD44 supports cell–cell adhesion  via hyaluronic acid  to \nthe endothelium and initiates transendothelial migration [19  \n25]  and cell–cell interactions may additionally be supported \nvia engagement of a heparan and chondroitin sulfate pro-\nteoglycan homologue of CD44 between adjacent cells [18]  \nBeyond CD44  other adhesion systems  including immuno-\nglobulin family members  e g  LCAM  ALCAM  L1-CAM  \nNCAM  may support cell–cell interactions in the absence of \nE-cadherin in ILC [26]  Cell–cell junctions in ILC are likely \nsufficiently stable to mediate cell–cell binding when tissue \ndensity is high and extracellular confinements force cells \ntogether  “cell-jamming”  [27] \n\nThe molecular variability of collective patterns suggests \nthat local tissue penetration represents a continuum from \nquiescent epithelium to multicellular epithelial invasion \n[28]  recapitulating variants of collective invasion during tis-\nsue morphogenesis and regeneration [5]  Likely  such variety \nof collective invasion patterns is relevant for other epithelial \nneoplasms  including colorectal and pancreatic cancer [10] \n\nCollective invasion as initiator of cancer metastasis\n\nInvasion of breast cancer cells into the adipose tissue cor-\nrelates with disease progression and poor clinical outcome  \nincluding lymph node metastasis and disease-free survival \n[1]  The here identified association between the extent of \ncollective cancer invasion into the adipose tissue and the \nappearance of distant metastasis supports concepts on \ntumor-cell cooperation [6] and paracrine adipose tissue \nfunctions in enhancing metastasis [29]  In this cohort study \nCI scores did not correlate with other known prognostic \n\nfactors  including tumor grade and size  This may indi-\ncate the CI score as an independent prognostic parameter  \nwhich requires verification by an independent dataset  The \nCI score  which here was obtained using clinical routine \nsamples  was not affected by variations of the region of adi-\npose tissue contained in each sample  The CI score will be \namenable to routine histopathological analysis  alongside \nwith currently used prognostic parameters [30] to identify \nparticularly high-risk patient subsets \n\nCollective invasion into the peritumor stroma may sup-\nport distant metastasis by several mechanisms  including \npro-survival  pro-invasive and mitogenic signals provided by \ncell–cell interactions and paracrine growth factors released \nbetween tumor cells [31]  its contribution to desmoplasia-\nlike ECM remodeling [32]  and by enabling a multicellular \nmass with high mechanical stability during both tissue pen-\netration and hematogenous spread [7]  In addition  tumor-\nassociated adipocytes express migration-enhancing ECM \ncomponents and soluble factors  which may promote tumor \ncell migration and intravasation by supporting angiogene-\nsis and increasing vessel permeability [29]  Tumor-cell and \nadipocyte-derived paracrine signaling may thus cooperate \nto enhance collective metastasis \n\nImplications\n\nThe range of collective invasion patterns detected in IDC and \nILC indicates remarkable morphologic and molecular diver-\nsity of collective behaviors  Defining E-cadherin-dependent \nand -independent types of cell–cell cooperation and their \ncross-talk with EMT and other activation programs will be \nrequired to define the subtypes  mechanisms and intercon-\nversions of collective cooperation in epithelial malignancies \n\nAcknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge Hans Peters  Wenny \nPeeters  Manon Vullings and Angela Vasaturo for excellent

HER2 IHC/FISH scoring  Additionally  the RT-qPCR assay is highly concordant \n 94%  with the continuous variable HER2 QIF assay  and may better reflect the true continuum of \nHER2 receptor status in

15–20% of primary breast cancers  Measurement of the \nexpression of this biomarker  either by protein-based methods  IHC  or fluorescence in situ \nhybridization  FISH  has become the standard of care companion diagnostic for \ntrastuzumab  pertuzumab  and T-DM1 [1  2]  The guidelines of the American Society of \nClinical Oncology  ASCO  and the College of American Pathologists  CAP  recommend \nroutine testing of HER2 expression on newly diagnosed breast cancers  However  5–10% of \nprimary breast tumors are designated equivocal for HER2 status using the current guidelines \n[3]  The equivocal HER2 test result creates uncertainty with respect to disease management  \nThus  a number of groups are pursuing strategies to definitively discriminate equivocal \nresults into those that will or will not respond to therapies targeting HER2 \n\nHere we determine the correlation between a real-time quantitative reverse transcription \npolymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR  assay  Xpert®

reported [2  5]  A series of \nmonochromatic high-resolution images were captured using an epifluorescent microsope \nplatform  For each TMA histospot  images were obtained for each fluorescent channel  \nDAPI  nuclei  Alexa 546  cytokeratin  and Cy5  HER2 target probe  In order to \ndistinguish tumor from tissue stroma and other components  an epithelial tumor “mask” was \ncreated by dichotomizing the cytokeratin signal  Briefly  the QIF score of HER2 in the tumor \ncompartment was calculated by dividing the HER2 compartment pixel intensities by the area \nof cytokeratin positivity resulting in a continuous score directly proportional to the \nconcentration of the biomarker of interest  QIF scores were normalized to the exposure time \nand bit depth at which the images were captured  allowing scores collected at different \nexposure times to be comparable  All acquired histospots were visually evaluated and cases \nwith staining artifacts or less than 2% tumor determined by cytokeratin staining were \nexcluded from the analysis as has been done in previous studies using the AQUA method of \nQIF [6] \n\nGeneXpert Instrument and Xpert Breast Cancer

Because \nthe cartridges are self-contained  cross-contamination concerns are eliminated  The BC \nSTRAT4 is designed as a multiplexed RT-qPCR assay incorporating primers and probes for \nthe quantitative assessment of four target mRNAs – ESR1  PgR  ERBB2  and MKi67 – and \none reference mRNA  CYFIP1  The reference mRNA verifies specimen adequacy and is \nused to normalize the mRNA expression levels of the target mRNAs  Additionally  the assay \nincludes an internal Probe Check Control  PCC  and a Cepheid Internal Control  CIC  to \nguarantee proper functioning of cartridge reaction components  To run the assay  a lysate is \nprepared using an FFPE Lysis Kit  Cepheid  An aliquot of the lysate is added to the \ncartridge and the cartridge is placed into the GX instrument  Results are available \napproximately 75 minutes later \n\nAssay Procedure\nIn this experiment  multiple  2–4  1 0 mm in diameter tumor cores of varying length from \nFFPE specimens were processed by mixing 5 μl Proteinase K with 260 μl FFPE lysis reagent \n Cepheid  to de-crosslink and release nucleic acids from the tumor cells  After a 30-minute \nincubation at 80 C  260 μl of 100% ethanol was added to the lysed sample  and the entire \nmixture was transferred to the test cartridge  The cartridge was inserted into a module of a \nGX Instrument where nucleic acid purification  amplification  and real-time detection was \nall fully automated and completely integrated by the system  All reagents required for \nsample preparation and RT-qPCR analysis are preloaded in the cartridge  Nucleic acids in \nthe lysate are captured on a filter  washed  and eluted by sonication  The purified nucleic \nacid is mixed with dry RT-qPCR reagents  and the solution is transferred to the reaction tube \nfor RT-qPCR and detection  The software automatically reviews the signal from both the \nCYFIP1 endogenous control and the HER2 transcript for acceptability  and calculates the \ndifference in cycle threshold  Ct  between the 2 signals  yielding a delta Ct  dCt  result \nwhich is categorized as positive or negative for the target mRNA based on pre-defined dCt \ncutoffs  The entire test process is completed in less than 2 hours  including sample \nincubation with less than 10 minutes of hands-on time \n\nRESULTS\nQuality control testing was done to determine whether sectioning of FFPE tissue blocks \nfrom HER2 positive cases prior to sectioning of HER2 negative cases would leave residual \nmaterial on the microtome or in the water bath that could contaminate subsequent RT-qPCR \nassessment  To determine this  routine histotechnology techniques were compared to an \nRNase-free protocol for tissue section preparation  Routine techniques  in addition to not \nrequiring any alteration to the daily histotechnology workflow used to prepare whole-tissue \nsection glass slides from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks  included but were \nnot limited to using the same microtome blade for different cases or until the blade was dull  \nfloating the tissue ribbon on a communal tap-water bath  and placing the tissue sections on \nglass slides that were not RNase-free or otherwise prepared to be free of incidental nucleic \nacids \n\nWasserman et al  Page 4\n\nLab Invest  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 11 \n\nA\nuthor

alkali \nhydroxide solution  RNase Away  prior to sectioning the tissue block  changing the \nmicrotome blade between cases  and changing the tap-water bath between floated sections  \nWe showed that the GX platform shows no detectable case to case cross contamination on \nmaterial from routine histology practices  Figure 2 \n\nTo assess concordance between the BC STRAT4 and IHC and FISH technologies we used a \ncohort of 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded invasive breast carcinomas seen at Yale \nPathology between 1998 and 2011  For each case  we measured mRNA by BC STRAT4 and \ncompared that to clinical assessment by IHC/FISH and to QIF  The distribution of BC \nSTRAT4 dCt scores showed good agreement with the clinical IHC/FISH results from each \ncase  figure 3  Concordance  OPA  between BC STRAT4 and IHC/FISH was 91 25% \n sensitivity = 0 87  specificity = 0 94  PPV = 0 89  NPV = 0 92  using a pre-defined delta Ct \ncut-off  dCt ≥ −1  for HER2-positivity

\ncomparison are less well established  To compensate for this  we chose a stringent cut-point \nthat would increase specificity at the expense of sensitivity  The cut-point separating HER2 \noverexpression and HER2 normal cases was determined to be 5000 Aqua Units  AU  using \nthe CB11 antibody at a 1 100 dilution  Figure 4  Using this AU cut-point  concordance \nbetween BC STRAT4  using the pre-defined cutoff of dCt ≥ −1  and QIF was 94% \n sensitivity = 0 90  specificity = 0 96  PPV =0 93  NPV = 0 94   Table 2 \n\nDISCUSSION\nThe current practice for determining HER2 receptor status in breast cancer by either IHC or \nFISH does not unequivocally define receptor expression  For IHC this may be due to its \nsemi-quantitative nature and non-standardized methods  FISH is thought by some to provide \na more accurate assessment for HER2 status [7  8] since a chromosome count can be done  \nbut the weakness of this method is that it does not necessarily reflect target protein \nexpression [9  10] and counting FISH spots is tedious and biased by tumor heterogeneity \n[11]  Historically  slide-based measurements of mRNA have been tested  including using \nseveral commercially available platforms [12–14]  but have not gained broad acceptance for \nassessment of HER2  However  RNA measurement  as a continuous value  has the potential \nfor more accurate assessment of receptor expression  including adjudication of the equivocal \ncategory \n\nIn the current analysis  our data demonstrate that the BC STRAT4 closed-system RT-qPCR \nassay shows greater than 90% concordance with ASCO/CAP 2007 HER2 IHC/FISH \nscoring  A significant weakness of this approach is that the 2007 system is no longer in \npractice and we now use the revised system established in 2013 [1]  Since the tissue used for \nthis study was obtained from specimens prior to 2013  the results from the older scoring \nsystem were retained  Future studies are underway that include recent tissue samples \n\nWasserman et al  Page 5\n\nLab Invest  Author manuscript  available in PMC 2018 March 11 \n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\nA\nuthor M\n\nan\nu\nscript\n\n\n\nPrevious studies by our group have suggested that QIF measurements of HER2 may be more \nanalytically accurate than the IHC standard of care [4]  However  since it is no longer \nacceptable to generate data from patients randomized to a placebo instead of trastuzumab  \nassessing clinical accuracy is challenging  the statistically rigorous interaction score cannot \nbe calculated without a “no treatment” arm  Fortuitously  robust quantitative methods are \navailable to assess analytic accuracy  within the limitations of non-randomized outcomes  \nSince the BC STRAT4 method has quantitative potential  we compared it to QIF  which has \nalso been shown to be quantitative [15]  It is notable that comparison of these two \nquantitative tests shows high concordance  94%  which may reflect the true biological \ncontinuum of HER2 receptor status in invasive breast cancer  These initial results suggest \nthat rapid  closed-system molecular assays may have a future value in resolving HER2 \nASCO/CAP guideline-determined equivocal cases  In addition  the observed high \nconcordance between the BC STRAT4 assay compared with QIF  as well as conventional \nmethods for assessing HER2 status  suggests that an analytically validated but easy to use \nRT-qPCR test may provide a reasonable solution for HER2 testing in resource limited \nsettings where conventional tests  such as IHC and FISH  are not available  Future efforts \nwith this assay will benefit from being tested in settings with known response to HER2-\ntargeted therapies \n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary  we compared a closed-system RT-qPCR assay  BC STRAT4  to conventional \nmethods  IHC and FISH  and QIF for assessing HER2 status in breast cancer  We found a \nhigh level of concordance between BC STRAT4 and the other methods  These results \nsuggest that  with further study  this platform could have utility in clinical settings including \nboth for adjudication of equivocal cases and for routine use in low resource settings \n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material \n\nAcknowledgments\nThe

low-risk  scores of 60  T1  T2  and T3-T4  subtypes  ER  PR  and HER2 status \n\nand treatment modalities  chemotherapy  radiotherapy  and hormone therapy  The hazard\n\nratio for distant recurrence

proliferation-related genes to determine the\n\nprognosis of ER  +  disease [31]  Consequently  these panels are limited by their clinical utility\n\nin other breast cancer subtypes  The gene expression profiles related to immune response and\n\nstromal invasion have prognostic value for ER  -  and high proliferative ER  +  breast cancer\n\npatients [32–35]  However  those classified by second-generation genomic panels as the low-\n\nrisk group had a 5-year relapse rate of up to 20% \n\nIn this study  18-GC identified 12% HER2  +  and 10% triple-negative breast cancer\n\npatients as the low-risk group with a 5-year distant metastasis rate of 5% and 0%  respectively \n\nFig 4  External validation of 18-GC   A  Validation based on data of 327 patients included dataset from NCBI

8  2017 11 / 15\n\n\n\n\n\nThis result opens the possibility of stratifying the relapse risk of non-luminal breast cancer\n\npatients  If this can be achieved  reduction of the chemotherapy dosage in this subset may be\n\npossible  Additionally  our study revealed that patients with high 18-gene scores would have a\n\nhigher risk of distant metastasis than those with low scores  the 5-year rate of DMFP was 20%–\n\n30% regardless of treatments  and therefore  dose-dense chemotherapy or a novel clinical trial\n\nmay be considered in these patients \n\nAlthough our research indicates great improvement in classifying breast cancer  there are\n\nlimitations to our study  First  it is a single-centered  retrospective study  Up to 89% of the\n\npatients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy  and 81% underwent radiotherapy  Although our\n\ndata showed that 18-GC is a prognostic tool in different treatment modalities  it is still hard to\n\nsurmise that adjuvant therapy can be omitted in the low-risk group  However  our data would\n\nenable the identification of a group of high-risk patients who may benefit from dose-dense che-\n\nmotherapy  higher dose of radiotherapy  or novel clinical trials  The 5-year distant metastasis\n\nrate in the low-risk group was only 2 7%  4/146  Meta-analyses of long-term outcomes have\n\nsuggested that adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the recurrence risk by 30%–50% [36]  Even\n\nif we assumed the greatest odds  say 50%  the initial distant metastasis rate without chemother-\n\napy in the low-risk group would be around 5%  Thus  only 3% may benefit from the procedure \n\nand it could expose the other 95% of patients to the toxic effect of chemotherapy in the low-risk\n\ngroup  A prospective  multi-centered study is warranted to validate whether the low-risk-group\n\npatients can forego chemotherapy for luminal breast cancer and whether the chemotherapy\n\ndosage may be decreased in non-luminal breast cancer  Second  some selection bias existed in\n\nour study  For the mRNA microarray  we preferentially enrolled those patients with recurrence\n\nor mortality  Therefore  our distant metastasis rate may overestimate the recurrence risk \n\nIn conclusion  the risk stratification limitations of clinical and pathological parameters still\n\nleave a significant number of patients with breast cancer at risk of overtreatment or suboptimal\n\ntreatment  However  the 18-GC can predict LRR and distant metastasis simultaneously  and\n\nwill aid the advancement into a new era of precision medicine and breast cancer treatment

results could be explained by the inclusion of different gene sets in each\nplatform  the use of different methodology  and the inclusion of clinicopathological parame-\nters  such as tumor size and nodal status  in the EndoPredict test \n\nIntroduction\nThe decision on adjuvant treatment for breast cancer patients is based on risk assessment\n\nusing clinicopathological criteria  such as patient age  menopausal status  axillary lymph node\n\nstatus  tumor size  tumor grade  estrogen receptor  ER /progesterone receptor  PgR  expres-\n\nsion  HER2 status  and Ki67 score  However  adjuvant treatment decision making in women\n\nwith ER+/HER2- early breast cancer remains as a difficult task  Routinely  all these patients\n\nwill receive adjuvant hormonal treatment  A substantial proportion of these patients are also\n\ntreated with adjuvant chemotherapy  although a significant part of these will not benefit from\n\nthis treatment [1]  Thus  a major challenge for clinical oncologists is to identify those patients\n\nwho will not benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy  and those who are more likely to develop\n\nrecurrence  so that the most appropriate therapeutic regime can be administered in each case\n\n[1 2] \n\nIn recent years  molecular characterization of breast cancer has contributed to improving\n\nour understanding of breast cancer as a complex disease  and led to the development of a vari-\n\nety of prognostic and predictive gene signatures that may also be useful in recurrence predic-\n\ntion and treatment decision making [3]  These molecular tests provide useful prognostic and\n\npredictive information that is independent of standard clinicopathological information  and\n\nmay be particularly helpful in cases for which measures of clinical risk are equivocal  i e \n\nsmall  node-negative  intermediate grade tumors  [4]  However  these genomic tests are based\n\nin different methodology and measure different genes  Moreover  they have been validated\n\nclinically in different cohorts from randomized clinical trials with long-term clinical outcomes \n\nRecent studies highlight the functional and clinically relevant impact of these multigene prog-\n\nnostic assays upon the adjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ early-stage breast carcinoma  indicating\n\nchemotherapy changes in approximately 25–30% of patients  with more changes against than\n\nfor adjuvant chemotherapy [5] \n\nOne of the most widely used test is the MammaPrint  MP  assay  Agendia Laboratories \n\nAmsterdam  The Netherlands  which is a prognostic score performed by a central laboratory\n\nthat was cleared by the FDA in 2007  MP was initially limited by its requirement for fresh\n\ntissue  but it is now validated for formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded  FFPE  tissue [6]  MP\n\nmeasures the expression of 70 genes using a microarray platform  and reports a binary risk\n\nclassification  low-risk or high-risk  for recurrence without adjuvant chemotherapy  This\n\ninformation is intended to spare patients at low-risk of recurrence from receiving adjuvant\n\nchemotherapy  with its attendant morbidity [7]  More recently developed  the EndoPredict\n\nassay  EP   Sividon Diagnostics GmbH  Cologne  Germany  is a test based on gene expression\n\ndata in combination with two clinicopathological risk parameters  tumor and nodal status  to\n\nComparison of

The molecular risk score is then combined with the nodal status and tumor\n\nsize resulting in a molecular-clinicopathological hybrid score  EPclin score  with improved\n\nprognostic power  Using a predefined cutoff value  patients are stratified into low- or high-risk\n\nof distant recurrence  The test can be carried out on routinely processed and archived FFPE\n\ntissue  and is designed to be performed decentrally [9 10]  EP was validated in three random-\n\nized phase III trials with patients with ER+/HER2-  node-negative and node-positive breast\n\ncarcinomas [8 11]  The EP provided additional prognostic information to conventional risk\n\nfactors such as grading  quantitative ER  or Ki67 and outperformed risk classification by clini-\n\ncal guidelines  Moreover  it could be demonstrated that EP is prognostic for early and late\n\nmetastasis [11 12]  The EPclin score was also directly compared to purely clinical risk classifi-\n\ncations  like St  Gallen  German S3  and NCCN  and found to be superior to these classifiers\n\n[12] \n\nThe main objective of this study was to compare retrospectively the concordance in risk\n\nclassification between the EndoPredict and the MammaPrint tests in 40 ER+/HER2- breast\n\ncarcinomas  We further compared TargetPrint  Agendia Laboratories  a commercially avail-\n\nable mRNA-based gene expression test that quantitatively determines gene expression levels of\n\nER  PgR  and HER2 with conventional immunohistochemistry/FISH analysis of ER  PgR  and\n\nHER2 \n\nMaterials and methods\nEthical standards\nThe study was

and\n\nEPclin score  and MP scores in 40 ER+/HER2- breast carcinomas  We found a moderate con-\n\ncordance between EP  EPclin and MP-based risk classifications with an overall concordance of\n\n72 5% and 75% between EP molecular score and MP  and EPclin score and MP  respectively \n\nTo the best of our knowledge  this is the first study comparing the concordance in risk\n\nclassification between the EndoPredict  EP/EPclin  and the MammaPrint tests in a series of\n\nER+/HER2- breast carcinomas  Interestingly  our study shows that despite the discrepancies\n\nobserved between EP and MP  both tests categorized the patients in the same proportion of\n\ncases of high- and low-risk categories  50% each group  These results are similar to those\n\nreported in previous studies comparing different gene expression signatures in breast cancer \n\nComparison of the poor prognosis group of the MP and the intermediate- and high-risk\n\ngroups from the Oncotype DX recurrence-score  RS  models showed that their sample predic-\n\ntions agreed in 77% of patients with ER+ early-stage breast carcinomas  These analyses suggest\n\nthat despite very little gene overlap and different algorithms used  the outcome predictions for\n\nthe majority of these patients would be similar [14]  The Optimal Personalised Treatment of\n\nearly breast cancer using Multiparameter Analysis preliminary study  OPTIMA prelim  com-\n\npared risk stratification and subtype classification of five multigene predictor tests  Oncotype\n\nDX  Prosigna [PAM50]  MammaPrint  MammaTyper  and NexCourse Breast [IHC4-AQUA] \n\nperformed in a series of 313 women with ER+/HER- early breast cancer that were randomized\n\nto chemotherapy and endocrine therapy or test-directed  chemotherapy if Oncotype DX RS\n\n>25  treatment [15]  Strikingly  although the five tests categorized similar numbers of tumors\n\nas low- or high-risk categories there was only moderate agreement between tests at the individ-\n\nual patient level  Thus  60 6% of tumors were assigned to different risk categories by different\n\ntests  kappa ranges 0 33–0 60  although 94  31 1%  showed agreement between four of five\n\ntests [15]  Therefore  current multi-parameter tests seem to provide broadly equivalent risk\n\ninformation in ER+/HER2- breast cancers at the population level  however  these tests may\n\nprovide different risk categorization for the individual patient [15]  Similar findings have been\n\ndescribed in a study comparing PAM50 and Oncotype DX [16]  In another study  Varga et al\nreported that the concordance of classification in low- or high-risk between Oncotype DX\n\n combining the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups to one high-risk group  and EP risk\n\nscore and EPclin score was 76% and 65%  respectively [17] \n\nAlthough most of the gene signatures currently available provide similar outcome predic-\n\ntions in node-negative patients  significant differences across predictors are present in node-\n\npositive disease  and for prediction of late metastasis with improved prognostic power of sec-\n\nond generation gene expression tests  such as EP  In this sense  TransATAC  the translational\n\nstudy of the Arimidex  Tamoxifen  Alone or in Combination trial  ATAC  has recently\n\naddressed the prognostic value of EP and EPclin for 10-year distant recurrence risk in post-\n\nmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- breast carcinomas  and compared their prognostic abil-\n\nity with that of the Oncotype DX RS [11]  This study confirmed the independent prognostic\n\nability of EP and EPclin in this cohort of patients  Moreover  EPclin demonstrated a better\n\nprognostic ability than RS mainly because of its integration with clinicopathological factors\n\n nodal status and tumor size  but also because of a superior molecular algorithm able to pre-\n\ndict late events better than RS  especially in node-positive patients [11]  This led Genomic\n\nHealth to develop an online Recurrence Score Pathology-Clinical  RSPC  calculator to use in\n\nER+/HER2-/node-negative breast cancer patients  RSPC combines RS with clinicopathological\n\nvariables  including patient age  tumor size  tumor grade  and planned adjuvant hormonal\n\ntherapy  tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor  [18]  RSPC has demonstrated a significantly more\n\nComparison of risk classification between EndoPredict and MamaPrint in breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183452 September 8  2017 8 / 12\n\n\n\n\nprognostic value for distant recurrence compared with RS alone  additionally  it showed better\n\nstratification of risk categories in the study population [19] \n\nMultiple factors may contribute to the discrepancies between EP and MP scores  These dif-\n\nferences could be partly due to the different main biological motives covered by the genes\n\nincluded in the test algorithms  such as proliferation or ER signaling  Some differences could\n\nbe explained by the coverage of other motives such as cell adhesion  invasion  or DNA repair \n\nas it has been demonstrated in previous studies comparing EP and Oncotype DX [17]  This\n\nheterogeneity may also be attributed partially to the different methodologies that were used to\n\nbuild both classifiers  cDNA microarray and qRT-PCR for MP and EP  respectively  and the\n\nheterogeneity in the sample population used to develop the tests  Moreover  each technology\n\nhas unique normalization methods \n\nWe observed a moderate statistically significant correlation between Ki67 and the EP score \n\nbut no correlation between Ki67 and the EPclin score  Similar results have been reported by\n\nVarga et al who performed a direct comparison of the concordance between Ki67 as a continu-\nous variable and the EP and EPclin scores in a series of 34 ER+ /HER2- breast carcinomas \n\nfinding a moderate statistically significant correlation between Ki67 and the EP score  Pearson\n\ncoefficient 0 55  p<0 0001  no significant correlation was observed between the EPclin score\n\nand Ki67  Pearson coefficient 0 24  p = 0 16  [17]  Using the Ki67 cutoff of 14% Dubsky et al\ndivided over 1 000 patients into luminal A and B subtypes and found that the EPclin score can\n\nsubdivide these patients into two additional groups related to prognosis [12]  Similarly  Filipits\n\net al demonstrated that the EP score provided independent prognostic information in a multi-\nvariate analysis with conventional clinicopathological factors  including Ki67  cutoff 11%  [8] \n\nThese data suggest that the EP molecular score will likely perform better than Ki67 alone for\n\nthe prognosis of breast cancer patients  but the performance of the EPclin score versus Ki67 is\nless clear \n\nTargetPrint  a diagnostic test for the precise molecular readout of ER  PgR  and HER2\n\nmRNA gene expression levels  was additionally analyzed in our series of patients  Our results\n\nshowed a high concordance between TargetPrint and IHC/FISH for ER  97 5%  and HER2\n\n 97 5%  and moderate concordance for PgR  77 5%  These results are similar to those\n\nreported previously  with concordances of approximately 96% for ER and 95% for HER2\n\n[13 20]  Regarding PgR  the concordance for mRNA and IHC analysis has been shown to be\n\napproximately 80% in previous studies [21 22]  However  mRNA-derived PgR status is more\n\nstrongly associated with clinical outcome and  therefore  mRNA could be more reliable for\n\nassessing PgR receptor status [23]  The reasons for the discordant results between mRNA read-\n\nout and IHC assessment of ER  PgR  and HER2 have not been elucidated so far  Suggested pos-\n\nsible causes such as intratumoral heterogeneity  have still not been analyzed in a randomized\n\nstudy [20] \n\nThe main limitations of this study are related to the moderate sample size which may have\n\nlimited the conclusions reached in the study  Thus  a further large-scale study including fol-\n\nlow-up data is necessary to validate our results \n\nIn conclusion  this study is the first direct comparison of risk stratification between\n\nEP/EPclin with MP  Our pilot study shows a limited concordance between EndoPredict and\n\nMammaPrint results on individual patients although both tests classified the same proportion\n\nof cases into high- and low-risk categories  Recent studies suggest that the addition of clinico-\n\npathological variables into these multigene predictor tests  such as EPclin  seems to improve\n\ntheir prognostic ability [24 25]  Discrepant results between tests reflect the fact that the assays\n\nare measuring different genes  using different methodology  and highlight the problems of pre-\n\ndicting recurrence risk in ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients [26]  Further clinical studies eval-\n\nuating large patient cohorts including follow-up data are needed to compare both tests \n\nComparison of risk classification between EndoPredict and MamaPrint in breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183452 September 8

variant MAFs between EAs and AAs  They may affect TLR9\nexpression and function  Rs352140  which may protect from breast cancer  is 1 6 X more\ncommon among EAs  These findings call for a detailed analysis of the contribution of TLR9\nto breast cancer pathophysiology and health disparities \n\nIntroduction\nToll Like Receptor-9  TLR9  is an endosomal DNA receptor that belongs to the innate\n\nimmune system  It recognizes and reacts to both microbial and vertebrate  self  DNA that has\n\nentered cells  either during microbial infections or during cell death [1–3] Activation of TLR9\n\nby DNA stimulation results in a rapid and a robust inflammatory reaction  with increased pro-\n\nduction of Th1-biased inflammatory mediators that activate the adaptive immune system [4–\n\n6] The outcome of this reaction is an immunological elimination of the invading microbe and\n\nthe infected cells [4  7] A similar inflammatory response occurs during sterile tissue damage \n\nsuch as infarction or trauma [8  9]\n\nTLR9 is also widely expressed in various human cancer cell lines and clinical tumors \n\nincluding breast  brain  lung  ovarian  prostate  kidney and GI-tract cancers [10–19] Stimula-\n\ntion of TLR9 with synthetic DNA-ligands  CpG-oligonucleotides  or cell-derived DNA has\n\nbeen shown to induce cytokine expression in TLR9-expressing cancer cells in vitro [20  21] In\naddition  both synthetic TLR9-ligands as well as cell-derived DNA induce cancer invasion in\nvitro [3  10  12  22  23] TLR9 can also regulate cancer cell invasion ligand-independently [15 \n24] The clinical relevance of these findings and the significance of TLR9 in cancer pathophysi-\n\nology has however  remained unclear  A recent meta-analysis by Wan et al  suggested that\ncertain TLR9 variants  such as rs187084  might be associated with an elevated cancer risk \nespecially in cervical cancer [25] Other TLR9 variants  such as rs352140 and rs5743836  respec-\ntively  were suggested to be protective of breast and digestive system cancers [25] Currently \n\nquite little is known about the functional effects of the various TLR9 genetic variants on cancer\nor other cells [26–29] When studied with immunohistochemistry  tumor TLR9 expression can\n\nindicate cancer-specific prognoses  on one hand  high TLR9 expression was associated with\n\ndecreased survival in brain  prostate and esophageal cancers [11  18  30] On the other hand  in\n\ntriple negative breast cancer  TNBC  renal cell carcinoma  mucoepidermoid salivary gland\n\ncarcinoma  and most recently in pancreatic cancer  low tumor TLR9 protein expression is\nassociated with poor survival [13  15  31–33]  This suggests that high tumor TLR9 expression\n\nprotects from relapses in these malignancies  The mechanisms for such protection are unclear \nOf all breast cancer patients  those with TNBC have the worst prognosis [34–36] These\n\ntumors are generally aggressive and lack the expression of drug

 PR  and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2\n\n HER2 [34–36] TNBC is especially troubling in African American  AA  women  Firstly  large\n\npopulation-based studies have identified a higher proportion of TNBC among premenopausal\n\nAA women [37] Secondly  AA women have higher mortality rate from breast cancer than Cau-\n\ncasian or European Americans  EA  even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account \n\n[37] Although the results of a recent study suggested that TNBC in AA women is not a unique\n\ndisease compared to TNBC in Caucasian women  biological differences have been indeed\n\ndetected [37–39] TLR9 has not been studied in breast or other cancer disparities previously \n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate tumor TLR9 expression among AA TNBC patients and\n\nto assess its relationship to survival and recurrence in this patient population  We also aimed\n\nto identify the landscape of germline TLR9 variants in both EAs and AAs  and determine if\nsuch variants contribute to AA breast cancer risk \n\nMaterials and methods\nBreast cancer specimens\nAA females with TNBC treated between 2000 and 2008 at The University of Alabama at Bir-\n\nmingham  UAB  Birmingham  Alabama  U S A  and with tissue available for analysis were\n\nidentified in a pathology database  The working data was for 51 patients  but the follow-up\n\ndata was available only for 43–49 subjects  The associated paraffin-embedded tumor blocks\n\nwere processed for immunohistochemical staining and evaluation of TLR9 expression using\n\nstandard techniques and as previously explained [15  40] Specifically  we used the following\n\ndefinition of TNBC to select the tumors for the immunohistochemical stainings  Tumors\n\nexhibiting any nuclear estrogen/progesterone receptor expression in invasive tumor cells were\nconsidered as steroid receptor-positive and excluded  Membranous HER2 expression was also\n\nstudied by means of immunohistochemistry  IHC  and if a specimen exhibited a HER2-posi-\n\ntive result in IHC  the HER2 gene amplification status was determined by means of chromo-\n\ngenic in situ hybridization  HER2-positive tumors were excluded  All patients got standard\ntreatment and care  consisting of surgery  radiation and chemotherapy  adjuvant or neo-adju-\n\nvant  The research was approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board and by the Ethics\n\nCouncil of The Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District  Oulu  Finland \n\nTumor TLR9 staining and scoring\nImmunohistochemical staining for TLR9 and scoring of the staining intensities were per-\n\nformed as previously described [40] Briefly  tissue sections of 5 μm in thickness were cut from\nthe formalin-fixed  archived  paraffin-embedded tissue blocks  Immunohistochemical staining\n\nwas performed with a LabVision Autostainer™  LabVision  Fremont  CA  USA  using the\nEnvision™ Detection System  K500711  Dako Denmark A/S  Glostrup  Denmark  The anti-\nbody used was the anti-TLR9  Img-305A  diluted 1 200  Imgenex  San Diego  CA  U S A \n\nTLR9-staining intensity scores  0–16  were divided into low    8 \nhttps //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183832

against\n\nbreast cancer [25] Considering that rs352140 is significantly more common in EAs than AAs\n\n Table 2  EAs likely benefit more from such protective effects than AAs  This variant disrupts\n\na CpG site  thus its effect on expression could play a role in disease susceptibility \n\nAAs have a total of 23 variants with a statistically significant higher MAF compared to EAs \n\nincluding 12 non-synonymous  missense  and 11 synonymous variants  Table 1  Seven of the\n\nmissense variants are located in the extracellular domain  and five are in the cytoplasmic\n\ndomain  Four are predicted to have strong pathogenic effects through Polyphen  Table 1  [48] \n\nthese are all extremely rare variants that could have detrimental effects on protein function  Of\n\nthe 11 synonymous variants  64% disrupt a CpG site  In fact  70% of all the statistically signifi-\n\ncant AA variants affect a CpG site  Table 1  Overall  AAs had a significantly higher percentage\n\nof variants that had statistically significant higher MAFs compared to EAs  P = 6 43 X 10−4 \n\nFurthermore  there was a significant difference in the total number of allele counts for all vari-\n\nant types between ethnicities  Table 3  Overall  EAs had more synonymous alleles compared\n\nto AAs but AAs had significantly more rare coding alleles  Table 3 \n\nTLR9 germline variants detected in TCGA AA breast cancer cases\nA total of 21 different germline TLR9 variants were detected in the 131 TCGA AA breast can-\ncer cases  Table 4  This included eight missense and 13 synonymous variants  Only one of the\n\nmissense variants  rs115440379  was predicted to be pathogenic  and it did not appear to be\n\nassociated with breast cancer  Table 4 and S4 Table  Of the 13 synonymous variants  8 dis-\n\nrupted a CpG site  Table 4  however  none appeared to be associated with breast cancer \n\nDespite not being statistically significant  p P545 =   rs352140  was observed even less fre-\n\nquently in the AA breast cancer cohort  Table 4 and S4 Table  which supports the previously\n\nreported protective effect [25] Six of the breast cancer variants are common  MAF > 1%  in\n\nthe general AA population with no statistical differences  and 15 are rare  MAF  \n\nA\nm\n\niss\nen\n\nse\nc \n\n13\nC>\n\nT\np \n\n R\n5C\n\n \nbe\n\nni\ngn\n\n 0\n

9 / 18\n\n\n\n\n\nis not currently known  Our studies in pre-clinical cancer models however demonstrated that\n\ndespite slower in vitro growth  TNBC cells with low TLR9 expression formed in vivo signifi-\ncantly larger tumors than those with high TLR9 expression [15] Notably  all our previous\n\n Caucasian  cohorts consisted of patients of European ethnicity  from Northern and Eastern\n\nFinland [15  33] Ethnicity of the patients with results similar to ours was not disclosed in the\n\nFrench cohort [32] Despite these promising results  tumor TLR9 expression is not currently\n\nused as a prognostic clinical tool  To be used as such will require further clinical studies  and\n\npreferably a demonstration that use of the TLR9 biomarker improves patient outcomes \n\nAA women with TNBC have a worse outcome than Caucasian women  The reason for this\n\nhealth discrepancy has remained unclear and controversial as both socioeconomic factors and\n\ntumor biology have been suggested as etiologic factors [39  49  50] To investigate the possible\n\nprognostic significance of tumor TLR9 in AA TNBC  we compared tumor TLR9 staining\n\nintensity upon diagnosis with disease outcomes in this patient group  Surprisingly  unlike\n\namong Caucasian TNBC patient population [15  32] high tumor TLR9 protein expression did\n\nnot protect from relapses among AA TNBC patients  In our previously published EA breast\n\ncancer cohort  ~ 90% of TNBC patients with high tumor TLR9 expression survived over 10\n\nyears  Of patients in the low TLR9 group  ~ 40% died within the first 5 years [15] The survival\n\ngap between the high and low tumor TLR9 TNBC groups was even greater in the French\n\nstudy [32] It is currently unclear how high tumor TLR9 expression protects from relapses in\n\nvarious cancers and especially in TNBC  The mechanisms involved could include effects on\n\ntumor immunity  tumor invasion  or autophagy  [3  10  15  51] There may however be  SNP-\n\nbased modifications of the effect of TLR9 on these cellular processes among AA TNBC\n\npatients  This could explain the lack of protection that tumor TLR9 provides in other ethnic\n\ngroups  These issues will  however  require further detailed experimentation at the cellular and\n\nmolecular level \n\nIn 2003  Lazarus et al  reported differences in TLR9 genetic variation between various ethnic\ngroups [52] Such differences might result in ethnic-specific TLR9 function or expression pat-\n\nterns that could  ultimately  also contribute towards disease susceptibility  progression

Americans\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183832 September 8  2017 12 / 18\n\n\n\n\n\nsurvival  We therefore carried out a similar but larger effort to understand TLR9 genetic differ-\nences between EAs and AAs  We indeed detected differences  Thirty-two TLR9 variants had a\nstatistically significant MAF difference between AAs and EAs  most of which have a higher\n\nMAF in AAs  Most of the detected differences are predicted to affect CpG-methylation  and\n\nthereby  possibly gene expression [47] Some of the missense variants with statistically signifi-\n\ncant MAF differences between the ethnicities are predicted to have profound effects on the\n\nTLR9 protein and function  Overall  rare missense alleles are more frequently present in AAs\n\ncompared to EAs  these rare variants could be related to ethnic-specific disease risk  The most\n\nnotable finding is the MAF distribution of rs352140  This TLR9 variant has been previously\nassociated with a decreased breast cancer risk [25] Specifically  the T allele was suggested to be\n\nprotective of breast cancer in a recent meta-analysis consisting of 12 197 cancer cases and\n\n13 488 controls [25] We identified a significantly higher T allele frequency in EAs compared to\n\nAAs  55 17 vs  34 52  p = 2 20E-16  suggesting EAs benefit more from the T allele’s protective\n\neffects than AAs  This synonymous variant disrupts a CpG site  thus its effect on expression\n\ncould play a role in disease susceptibility  The mechanism of how the T allele of rs352140\n\nmight protect from breast cancer has been investigated  but it is currently debatable [29  52–\n\n55] In fact  rs352140 has even been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers [56]\n\nFurther investigation is required to more clearly understand rs352140 and cancer-specific risk \n\nNoteworthy  through our case/control analysis  we detected even less T alleles in AA breast\n\ncancer cases compared to AA controls  which is expected if the allele is protective against\n\nbreast cancer  however  our results were not statistically significant \n\nOur efforts to test an association of germline TLR9 variants with AA breast cancer risk did\nnot reveal any variant class differences between cases and controls  however  three previously\n\nunreported TLR9 variants appears to be slightly associated with late  >45 years  onset breast\ncancer  These included two missense  p D864N  and p E865K  and one synonymous  p \n\n F873 =  variants and are predicted to be benign  Furthermore  only the synonymous variant\n\naffects a CpG site  Each variant was detected in one breast cancer case in the cohort  thus \n\nthese findings need to be replicated  Furthermore  our AA breast cancer cohort did not specifi-\n\ncally address TNBC cases  due to limited clinical information available for TCGA data  There-\n\nfore  genetic associations specifically with TNBC are warranted  In addition to assessing breast\n\ncancer risk  also the contribution of these SNPs to breast cancer specific-survival requires fur-\n\nther studies \n\nIt is currently unclear what molecular events drive the expression of the TLR9 variants \n\nEspecially the rs352140 variant has been  however  associated with infections such as malaria\n\nand meningitis  [53  57] Specifically  the minor T allele has been associated with increased\n\ninflammation and thereby increased symptoms of these infectious diseases  possibly indicating\n\na stronger immune reaction  as also noted in placental inflammation [29  58] Whether or not\n\nsuch increased inflammatory response also protects from the development of breast cancer\n\nremains to be characterized  Conversely  the weaker immune response  and thereby lesser\n\nsymptoms may have initially provided an evolutionary survival advantage  possibly explaining\n\nthe enrichment of such variant in people with African ancestry  Taken together  these hypothe-\n\nses require further studies \n\nIn conclusion  unlike among Caucasian TNBC patients  high tumor TLR9 protein expres-\n\nsion is not associated with improved survival among AA TNBC patients  This may be due to\n\ndifferences in TLR9 function or expression  caused by variants in the TLR9 gene  Our results\nshow that EAs more frequently carry the T allele of rs352140 when compared to AAs  which\n\nhas been associated with protection from breast cancer  Thus  this TLR9 variant may be a pre-\nviously unknown source of health disparity in breast cancer  Our results need

metastatic activity of breast carcinomas results from complex genetic changes in epi-\nthelial tumor cells and accounts for 90% of deaths in affected patients  Although the invasion\nof the local lymphatic vessels and veins by malignant breast tumor cells and their subse-\nquent metastasis to the lung  has been recognized  the mechanisms behind the metastatic\nactivity of breast tumor cells to other distal organs and the pathogenesis of metastatic can-\ncer are not well understood  In this study  we utilized derivatives of the well-established and\nhighly metastatic triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  cell line MDA-MB-231  MDA-231  to\nstudy breast tumor metastasis in a mouse model  These MDA-231 derivatives had depleted\nexpression of Kaiso  a POZ-ZF transcription factor that is highly expressed in malignant  tri-\nple negative breast cancers  We previously reported that Kaiso depletion attenuates the\nmetastasis of xenografted MDA-231 cells  Herein  we describe the pathological features of\nthe metastatic activity of parental  Kaisopositive  versus Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells  Both\nKaisopositive and Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells metastasized from the original tumor in the\nmammary fat pad to the lung  However  while Kaisopositive cells formed large masses in the\nlung parenchyma  invaded large pulmonary blood vessels and formed secondary metasta-\nses and large tumors in the distal organs  Kaisodepleted cells metastasized only to the lung\nwhere they formed small metastatic lesions  Importantly  intravascular invasion and second-\nary metastases in distal organs were not observed in mice xenografted with Kaisodepleted\n\ncells  It thus appears that the lung may constitute a barrier for less invasive breast tumors\nsuch as the Kaisodepleted TNBC cells  this barrier may limit tumor growth and prevents\nKaisodepleted TNBC cells from invading the pulmonary blood vessels and forming secondary\nmetastases in distal organs \n\nPLOS ONE | https

[5–9]  pancreas [10]  endometrium [11] \n\nthyroid gland [12 13] and Merkel cell [14] have been shown to invade lymphoid vessels and\n\nblood vessels [2 6 8 9 11–14] resulting in metastases to distant organs  particularly the lung\n\n[7 9]  According to the systemic and pulmonary circulatory patterns  cancer cells that escape\n\nthe primary tumor site and enter the bloodstream would first disseminate to the lung via the\n\nright ventricle before dispersing from the lung through the left heart to distal organs  Charac-\n\nterization of the mechanisms of malignant mammary carcinoma indicates that in the primary\n\ntumor  a small population of cells travel towards the blood vessels  and invade them in a com-\n\nplex process involving enhanced activity of genes regulating the dynamics of the actin cytoskel-\n\neton  e g  Mena [2 15–17] and LIM kinase1 [18]  In a series of in vivo experiments in mouse\nand rat models utilising multiphoton microscopy  migrating tumor cells were seen to be assis-\n\nted by perivascular macrophages in the process of vascular invasion and metastases to distant\n\norgans  which involved chemotaxis regulated by EGF and CSF-1 [1 15–17 19–23] \n\nThe progression of breast tumors towards an invasive behaviour and metastasis are postu-\n\nlated to involve several molecular factors associated with the complex epithelial-to-mesenchy-\n\nmal transformation  EMT  process that endows tumor cells with the ability to modulate their\n\ncell-cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix [24–26 47 48 50–52]  apparently involved in the\n\nfirst line of defense against metastatic tumors  EMT is frequently accompanied by loss of the\n\nepithelial marker E-cadherin  concurrent with elevated expression of vimentin [41–45]  an\n\nintermediate filament that participates in cell motility [46]  as well as increased expression of\n\nmatrix metalloproteases-2 and -9  MMP-2  MMP-9  [27–32] that are often assessed in the\n\ndetermination of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [33–36]  Tissue plasminogen activa-\n\ntor  tPA  and urokinase plasminogen activator  uPA  are known to activate pro-enzyme forms\n\nof MMP-2 and MMP-9 to active forms [37 38] and tPA and uPA have been proposed as mark-\n\ners for breast cancer progression [39 40] \n\nDespite remarkable advancements in our understanding of cellular and molecular mecha-\n\nnisms involved in tumor growth and intravascular invasion at primary tumor sites  relatively\n\nlittle is known about how malignant tumors travel to distant organs  Since all lymph and\n\nvenous blood from the body flows via the right heart ventricle to the lung  it is expected that\n\nmost if not all primary metastases of carcinomatous tumors are trapped in small pulmonary\n\nblood vessels  However  the relevant questions regarding the pathogenesis of metastatic cancer\n\nremain  how do secondary metastases travel to other distant organs  and what are the mecha-\n\nnisms involved in the generation of these secondary metastases \n\nTo gain insight into the mechanisms involved in breast tumor metastases to distant organs \n\nwe studied the pathogenesis of secondary metastases of parental  Kaisopositive and experimental\n\nKaisodepleted MDA-231 TNBC cells in immunocompromised mice [53]  Kaiso is a dual-\n\nspecificity transcription factor that is highly expressed in  and linked with the aggressive fea-\n\ntures of breast  prostate  colon and pancreatic carcinomas [54–57]  We previously reported\n\nthat Kaiso depletion strongly inhibited the metastasis of TNBC cells to distal organs [53] \n\nHerein  we describe histological analyses of the metastases generated by parental Kaisopositive\n\nand Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells \n\nWe found that Kaisopositive MDA-231 breast cancer cells implanted into the mammary fad\n\npad of immunocompromised mice [53] formed large tumor masses in the lung parenchyma \n\ninvaded large blood vessels and metastasised to other distant organs where it also formed large\n\nmasses  In contrast  Kaisodepleted tumor cells formed small clusters only in the lung paren-\n\nchyma and did not invade blood vessels and did not metastasize to distant organs  While the\n\nKaiso expressing breast cancer cells form secondary metastases\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183883 September 7  2017 2 / 17\n\ndata collection and analysis  decision to publish  or\n\npreparation of the manuscript \n\nCompeting interests  The authors have declared\n\nthat no competing interests exist \n\n\n\n\nrole of high Kaiso expression in the metastatic activity of human breast cancer cells was\n\nreported in our previous paper [53]  we describe here the critical importance of high Kaiso\n\nexpression in the propagation of breast tumors to distal organs beyond the lung  which we call\n\n“secondary metastases”  We propose that the lung serves as the second line of defense against\n\ncarcinomas with metastatic potential  tumors with less malignant characteristics such as\n\nKaisodepleted MDA-231 cells are trapped  do not progress and perhaps are eliminated  In con-\n\ntrast  malignant tumors such as Kaisopositive MDA-231 cells thrive in the lung to form large\n\nmasses that then  invade the large pulmonary blood vessels  travel via the left heart ventricle\n\nand lodge in small blood vessels of a variety of peripheral organs where they form secondary\n\nmetastases \n\nMaterials and methods\nGeneration of stable Kaiso-depleted MDA-231 cells\nThe MDA-231 TNBC cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection\n\n ATCC   Manassas  VA  USA  and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium\n\n DMEM  Lonza BioWhittaker1  Walkersville  MD  USA  supplemented with 10% Fetal\n\nBovine Serum  FBS  Hyclone  Logan  Utah  USA  0 1 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin and\n\n0 25 g/mL Fungizone  Invitrogen  Grand Island  NY  USA  Cells were passaged every 2 or 3\n\ndays and grown in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37˚C  Stable Kaiso-depletion was\n\nachieved by using multiple Kaiso-specific short hairpin RNAs  shRNA  that target the Kaiso\n\nmRNA specifically as previously described [49]  A scrambled shRNA that does not target the\n\nKaiso mRNA was used as a control  Stable control  Kaisopositive  and Kaisodepleted  sh-K \n\nMDA-231 cells were maintained in DMEM-supplemented media treated with Puromycin\n\n Invitrogen  at 0 8 μg/mL \n\nWestern blot analysis\nStable control Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted  sh-K1 and sh-K2  MDA-231 cells were cultured\n\nuntil ~80–90% confluent  washed twice with cold PBS  and then harvested by cell scraping into\n\ncold microfuge tubes  Control  sh-K1 and sh-K2 MDA-231 cells were then pelleted by centrifu-\n\ngation  lysed  and protein isolated as previously described [59]  Rabbit anti-Kaiso polyclonal\n\n 1 5 000 dilution  a generous gift from Dr  A  Reynolds  and mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal\n 1 50 000 dilution  Sigma Aldrich  Oakville  ON  Canada  primary antibody incubations were\n\nperformed overnight at 4˚C  Secondary antibody incubations were performed with goat anti-\n\nrabbit- or donkey anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies \n\n 1 10 000 dilution  Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories  West Grove  PA  USA  Signals\n\nwere then amplified with Clarity Western Enhanced Chemiluminescence substrate as previ-\n\nously described [53]  The sh-K2 MDA-231 cells  hereafter referred as sh-K or Kaisodepleted\n\nMDA-231 cells  where chosen for all subsequent studies as these cells displayed the most effi-\n\ncient Kaiso knockdown \n\nAnimal studies\nAll animal studies were approved and performed at McMaster University  Ontario  Canada\n\naccording to the guidelines by the Canadian Council for Animal Care  Extensive description of\n\nanimal studies has been outlined previously [53]  Briefly  4 5 x 106 Kaisopositive or Kaisodepleted\n\nMDA-231 cells were injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad of 6–8 week old\n\nfemale NOD SCID Gamma  NSG  Jackson Laboratories  mice  n = 5 each per condition  and\n\nallowed to form prominent subcutaneous masses up to 3 300 mm3 in volume  Non-invasive\n\nKaiso expressing breast cancer cells form secondary metastases\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183883 September 7  2017 3 / 17\n\n\n\n\nmonitoring of mice was performed once a week  and increased to 2–3 times per week upon\n\ntumor appearance  Tumor growth was monitored externally with vernier calipers and tumor\n\nvolume  in mm3  measured using the following formula  length/2 × width2  2–3 times per\nweek [53]  This tumor mass volume was achieved before the onset of serious clinical signs\n\nsuch as body weight loss  dehydration and lethargy that would require the application of the\n\nendpoint and euthanasia  The endpoint tumor volume of 3 300 mm3 was determined in pilot\n\nexperiments prior to the study  At endpoint  the mice were euthanized by overdosing with\n\nintraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital  100 mg/kg body weight  perfused when\n\ndeeply anaesthetized  and fixed in 10% formalin and all routine tissues collected for histologi-\n\ncal examination \n\nHistology and Immunohistochemistry\nHarvested and formalin-fixed tissues were processed  embedded in paraffin wax  and 5 μm\nthick tissue sections were then mounted on glass slides and stained with either hematoxylin &\n\neosin  H&E  or Masson’s trichrome  Immunohistochemical  IHC  analyses of tissue sections\n\nwere performed as described previously [53]  Briefly  tissues were rehydrated in decreasing\n\nconcentrations of alcohol  and deparaffinized in xylene before antigen retrieval by heating tis-\n\nsues in a sodium citrate solution  pH 6 0  in a microwave  Primary antibody incubations were\n\nperformed overnight at 4˚C with the following antibodies  anti-Kaiso 6F mouse monoclonal\n\n 1 500  anti-Kaiso 12H mouse monoclonal  1 800  [58]  anti-Vimentin rabbit monoclonal\n\nantibody  1 500  Cell Signaling Technology  CST  Danvers  MA  USA #5741  anti-E-cad-\n\nherin mouse monoclonal antibody  1 50  BD Biosciences  Mississauga  ON  Canada 610182 \n\nanti-MMP-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody  1 1000  CST #4022BC  and anti-MMP-9 rabbit poly-\n\nclonal antibody  1 1000  CST # 3852BC  Secondary antibody incubations were performed for\n\n2 hours at room temperature with either biotinylated goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit\n\nantibody at a dilution of 1 1000  Negative controls were obtained by excluding primary anti-\n\nbody  Histological analysis of H&E  Masson’s trichome and IHC-stained tissue sections were\n\nperformed using a Nikon Eclipse 50 light microscope and representative phenotypes\n\nphotographed \n\nResults and discussion\nProtein expression\nExpression of Kaiso in MDA-231 cells was abundant but remarkably reduced in sh-K1  to\n\n28%  and sh-K2  to 6%   see Fig 1  as the result of the stable transfection of the Kaiso-specific\n\nshRNA in these cells  Sh-K2 cells were utilized as Kaisodepleted in the xenograft studies \n\nClinical observations and histological analyses\nThe subcutaneous

obliteration of the vascular wall by tumor cells forming a continuity of peri-\n\nvascular and intravascular tumors  Fig 3B–3D  The apparent vascular invasion of Kaisopositive\n\ntumors was often associated by formation of thrombi infiltrated by tumor cells  Fig 3D  In\n\ncontrast  Kaisodepleted tumor cells formed small aggregations scattered in the alveolar paren-\n\nchyma  Fig 3E and 3G  sometimes adjacent to large blood vessels but with no invasion of the\n\nvascular wall or the lumen  Fig 3F  Kaisodepleted tumor aggregations were often infiltrated by\n\nscattered neutrophils  Fig 3G \n\nAlthough Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted cancer cells both formed subcutaneous masses and\n\ninvaded nearby veins and lymphatics resulting in pulmonary metastases  Kaiso-depletion\n\nmarkedly supressed the ability of cancer masses to grow expansively in the lung  and elimi-\n\nnated their ability to invade blood vessels thereby restricting their spread to other organs \n\nIndeed  tumors were not observed in any other organ except in the lung of mice injected with\n\nKaisodepleted cells  In contrast  in mice injected with Kaisopositive cells  large tumors were\n\nobserved in the liver  Fig 4A and 4B  kidney  Fig 4C and 4D  myocardium  Fig 4E and 4F \n\nand infrequently in the adrenal gland and leptomeninges of the brain  not shown  Thus \n\nKaiso appear to play a regulatory role to

highly aggressive subtypes of breast cancer [53 54 60] \n\nOur findings suggest that Kaiso could be a target for therapeutic strategies in the treatment of\n\naggressive breast cancers  Some large blood vessels within a tumor mass or adjacent to it  such\n\nas in the liver  Fig 4A  or in kidney  Fig 4C  had intraluminal invasion of tumor cells with for-\n\nmation of thrombus and obliteration of

lung\n\nand other organs  Figs 4 and 5  This is in line with other studies that have also demonstrated\n\nvascular taxis and intravascular invasion of breast tumors implanted subcutaneously into mice\n\n[1 15–17 19–23]  The active penetration of the vascular wall by Kaisopositive cells lead to their\n\naccessing of the lumen with frequent formation of thrombus  This pathogenesis implies two\n\npotential mechanisms   1  tumor cells breached the endothelium of the tumor–invaded blood\n\nvessel  which may have led to thrombosis   2  the tumor cells then invaded the thrombus as the\n\nconvenient substrate  which lead to the increase of the intravascular load of cancer cells des-\n\ntined to metastasize to other organs  We also observed endothelium lining of the intravascular\n\ntumor masses with or without thrombosis  We consider that neo-endothelialization of the\n\nintravascular tumor masses and tumor thrombi may serve as a defense mechanism preserving\n\nthe patency of the blood flow  We thus postulate that this putative defense mechanism may\n\nactually be subverted by the invading tumor cells allowing for the increase of their intravascu-\n\nlar load and presumably leading to a greater chance of success of secondary metastases \n\nImmunohistochemical analyses\nKaisopositive primary tumor tissues  as expected  stained

blot results\n\n Fig 1  we were surprised to observe weak Kaiso staining in the primary tumors which was\n\npredominantly cytoplasmic  Fig 6D  The weak Kaiso staining could be due to deselection of\n\nthe Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells as the mice were not subjected to constant treatment with\n\nPuromycin that would ensure selection and maintenance of shRNA plasmid in the stable cells\n\nin vitro  Nonetheless  the Kaiso staining observed in Kaisodepleted tumor tissues was still\nremarkably reduced compared to the staining observed in the Kaisopositive tumor tissues\n\n Fig 6A and 6D  Kaisodepleted MDA-231 tumor tissues also stained weakly for Vimentin\n\n Fig 6E  as expected from in vitro findings in our previous report [53]  In contrast  while we\nhad observed increased E-cadherin expression in the Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells in vitro [53] \nthe Kaisodepleted MDA-231 tumor tissues stained negative for E-cadherin  Fig 6F  This lack\n\nof E-cadherin staining could be due to the weak levels of Kaiso expression observed in the\n\nKaisodepleted MDA-231 primary tumors  Fig 6D  or due to other in vivo factors in the tumor\nmicroenvironment that are independent of Kaiso’s expression or Kaiso’s effect on E-cadherin\n\nexpression \n\nAnalysis of the tumor masses observed in the lung  Fig 7A  of mice injected with the\n\nKaisopositive and Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells also revealed that the Kaisopositive tumor cells that\n\nmetastasized to the lung exhibited strong Kaiso  Fig 7Ai  and Vimentin  Fig 7Aii  staining but\n\nno E-cadherin staining  Fig 7Aiii  while Kaisodepleted tumor metastases in the lung displayed\n\nweak Kaiso  Fig 7Aiv  and Vimentin  Fig 7Av  staining  but no E-cadherin staining  Fig 7vi \n\nThese findings suggest a persistence of the

and\n\nMMP-9  Fig 7Cx  staining  These findings also imply a persistence of the molecular phenotype\n\nof the Kaisopositive MDA-231 cells as they metastasized to other distal organs \n\nIn this study we analyzed the metastatic progression of Kaisopositive and Kaisonegative malig-\n\nnant mammary carcinomas using in vivo transplantation experiments in a mouse model  We\n\nfound that Kaisopositive and Kaisonegative MDA-231 cancer cells both formed subcutaneous\n\nmasses and invaded nearby veins and lymphatics apparently leading to pulmonary metastases \n\nHowever  Kaiso-depletion was associated with remarkable suppression of the growth of cancer\n\ncells in the lung  In contrast  high Kaiso-expressing tumor cells thrived in the lung  invaded\n\nlarge pulmonary blood vessels and metastasized to other organs  These findings suggest that\n\nKaiso plays a key role in metastatic activity of MDA-231 cancer cells  The penetration of the\n\nvascular wall and invasion of the lumen of large blood vessels abundant in the lung and other\n\norgans appears to be the fundamental factor of malignancy of the Kaisopositive tumor cells  This\n\nis in line with other studies that have also demonstrated vascular taxis and intravascular inva-\n\nsion of breast tumors implanted subcutaneously into mice [1 15–17 19–23]  Immunohisto-\n\nchemical characterization of Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted tumors in this study revealed that\n\nKaisopositive tumor cells exhibit more features associated with malignancy  increased Kaiso \n\nVimentin  MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression  than the Kaisodepleted tumor cells  which only dis-\n\nplayed increased MMP-9 expression  Moreover  Kaiso expression seem to correlate positively\n\nwith Vimentin and MMP-2 but not MMP-9 expression  Indeed Kaiso-depletion resulted in\n\ndecreased Vimentin and MMP-2 but not MMP-9 expression  The similar staining of MMP-9\n\nand lack of E-cadherin staining in both Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted tumor cells  which is a\n\nmarker of EMT  may explain the ability of both cell types to metastasize to the lungs  However \n\nconsidering that only the Kaisopositive tumor cells were capable of surviving in the lungs  invad-\n\ning blood vessels and forming macrometastases in other distal organs  the higher Kaiso expres-\n\nsion in concert with the increased Vimentin and MMP-2 expression could be considered as\n\nthe critical determinants that allowed the Kaisopositive tumors to thrive after metastasis to the\n\nlung  and other distant organs \n\nWe thus propose that the lung serves as the second line of defense against carcinomas with\n\nmetastatic potential where tumors with less malignant characteristics  e g  with reduced\n\nexpression of Kaiso  are trapped  do not progress and perhaps are eliminated  Consequently \n\nsecondary metastases to the distant organs are prevented  We further postulate  that malignant\n\ntumors such as human breast tumors with high Kaiso expression can overcome this defensive\n\nmechanism  thrive in the lung and form large masses whose cells invade the blood vessels \n\ntravel via the left heart ventricle to lodge in small blood vessels of a variety of peripheral organs \n\nand initiate multiple secondary metastatic tumors leading to accelerated demise  Fig 8  If this\n\nhypothesis is proven to be correct  potential cancer-suppressive tissue mechanisms in the lung\n\nshould be considered in the pathogenesis of cancer metastasis  Also  models used to evaluate\n\nKaiso expressing breast cancer cells form secondary metastases\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10

cells of the local veins and lymphatics allows the cells to migrate via the right heart ventricle to the lung\nwhere they are trapped in the capillary blood vessels  b v  and form pulmonary metastases  While in the lung  Kaisopositive\ncells proliferate successfully and form large  coalescing masses that send the cells to actively cross the wall of adjacent blood\nvessels and invade their lumen  Kaisodepleted tumor cells form small aggregations that do not invade blood vessels therefore\n\nKaiso expressing breast cancer cells form secondary metastases\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10

metastases from the lung to other organs  The possibility\n\nof the lung as the second line of defence  with potential anti-cancer mechanisms sufficient to\n\nstall Kaisodepleted but not Kaisopositive breast cancer cells should be addressed in further studies \n\nConclusions\nIn this report  we analyzed the metastatic progression of Kaisopositive and Kaisonegative malig-\n\nnant mammary carcinomas using in vivo transplantation experiments in a mouse model \nAlthough this study utilizes the end point metastasis analysis of disseminated breast tumor\n\ncells  it highlights potential novel mechanisms involved in secondary metastases and provides\n\ndetailed histological evidence of different behaviour of MDA-231 malignant breast cancer\n\ncells depending on the expression level of Kaiso  Both Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted tumor\n\ntypes   1  formed subcutaneous masses of cells with morphological features of malignancy \n\n 2  invaded adjacent veins and lymphatic vessels  and  3  metastasized to the lung  However \n\nwhile Kaisopositive cells   i  formed large pulmonary tumors   ii  actively invaded pulmonary\n\nblood vessels apparently leading to  iii  secondary metastases and tumors in a variety of distal\n\norgans  Kaisodepleted tumors formed only small aggregates in the lungs  did not invade pulmo-\n\nnary blood vessels and did not form secondary metastases  Thus  Kaiso may be a potent factor\n\nenabling breast cancer cells to overcome apparent inhibitory mechanisms in the lung and to\n\nsend secondary metastases throughout distant organs \n\nSupporting

recommendation than the\nuPA/PAI-1 test  46% vs 24%  Recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy  CTX  was\nabandoned twice as often by EPclin  45%  compared to uPA/PAI-1  22% \n\nConclusion\nIn this first prospective comparison of EPclin and uPA/PAI-1 we found  that EPclin is supe-\nrior to uPA/PAI-1 with respect to feasibility and decision impact  This leads to substantial\navoidance of adjuvant CTX in endocrine-sensitive  HER2-negative breast cancer  Data col-\nlection for patients´ clinical outcome is ongoing \n\nIntroduction\nPatients diagnosed with early breast cancer are faced with life-long risk of distant metastases \n\nNevertheless  along with intensified early detection and optimized adjuvant systemic therapies \n\nan improvement of disease-free and overall survival could be observed in recent years [1]  In\n\nthe overall patient population  adjuvant chemotherapy  CTX  shows a significant therapeutic\n\nbenefit [2]  However  focusing on the population of patients with hormone receptor  HR  pos-\n\nitive disease  it becomes clear that there are patient subgroups that will be cured just by adju-\n\nvant endocrine therapy without adjuvant CTX  Validated prognostic markers are required to\n\nidentify this subgroup  Recognized conventional prognostic markers with proven relevance\n\nare tumor size  nodal status  grading  histological subtype and age  Still  these biomarkers are\n\ninsufficient to obtain adequate risk stratification in a HR-positive  HER2-negative population \n\nTherefore  a number of additional new molecular biomarkers has been developed and vali-\n\ndated which allow a better defined distinction between \"high\" and \"low\" risk of metastases \n\nThe urokinase plasminogen activator  uPA  system plays an important role in the process\n\nof tumor cell invasion and metastasis [3]  As early as 1988  it was demonstrated that elevated\n\nlevels of uPA in tumor tissue of breast cancer patients are associated with poor prognosis [4] \n\nShortly after  it was shown for the first time that also high concentrations of plasminogen acti-\n\nvator inhibitor-1  PAI-1  are associated with a worse clinical course [5]  Observations in vari-\n\nous animal models showed that uPA is a crucial factor in the process of tumor progression [6] \n\nuPA and PAI-1 have been investigated as prognostic factors in early breast cancer in many ret-\n\nrospective and prospective  independent clinical trials ever since  The determination of uPA\n\nand PAI-1 concentration in tumor tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  is\n\nthe first prospectively validated biomarker in early breast cancer with level of evidence  LOE \n\n1A  following the systematics of Hayes et al [7]  As part of the multicenter Chemo-N0-trial\n\n n = 647  12 centers  it was shown that in N0 patients the uPA/PAI-1 test can identify a\n\ngroup of patients that can be spared adjuvant CTX [8]  Based on these results and on the data\n\nfrom a comprehensive meta-analysis  n = 8377  conducted by the European Organisation for\n\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer  EORTC  [9]  uPA/PAI-1 has been recommended as bio-\n\nmarker for risk stratification and

Oncology  AGO  since 2006 [10] [11]  Despite convinc-\n\ning data and a commercially available ELISA assay for uPA/PAI-1  the proteolytic factors are\n\nnot generally used as biomarkers for prognostic assessment of early breast cancer in clinical\n\npractice  Also uPA/PAI-1 has never been included as a prognostic factor in the recommenda-\n\ntions of the St  Gallen Consensus Conference  One reason

stratification based on gene expression analysis was described for the first time by\n\nPerou and colleagues with the introduction of the intrinsic subtypes in the molecular pathol-\n\nogy of breast cancer [13]  It was shown that various intrinsic subtypes are associated with a dif-\n\nferent prognosis of the disease  which affects the overall and relapse-free survival [14]  Based\n\non these findings  several commercially available gene expression tests have been developed \n\nThe tests allow identifying a group of patients whose prognosis under adjuvant endocrine ther-\n\napy is so good that adjuvant CTX can be abandoned  For these patients the expected benefits\n\nof CTX would be smaller than the risks conferred by CTX  A number of these multiparameter\n\nassays has been added to the therapy recommendation of the St  Gallen International Expert\n\nConsensus  including the EndoPredict 1 test  EPclin  [15] \n\nEPclin is a RNA-based 11-gene expression test which can be carried out on formalin-fixed \n\nparaffin-embedded  FFPE  tumor tissue  It allows the prediction of the likelihood of distant\n\nmetastases in patients with ER-positive  HER2-negative breast cancer  The test has been vali-\n\ndated in four large randomized phase III studies  ABCSG-6  n = 378  ABCSG-8  n = 1324 \n\nGEICAM9906  n = 555 and ATAC  n = 928  and thus has the evidence level LOE IB according\n\nto Simon et al [7]  EPclin was the first gene expression test to demonstrate that it provides\n\nadditional prognostic information on top of grading  tumor size  nodal status and ki67 in a\n\ncohort of endocrine-sensitive breast cancer patients [16]  More recent data show that EPclin\n\nalso predicts late metastasis and local recurrence in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer\n\n[17 18] \n\nThe aim of this prospective study was to compare the two prognostic tests uPA/PAI-1 and\n\nEPclin with regard to feasibility  risk stratification  and impact of the test result on adjuvant\n\ntherapy recommendation in hormone-sensitive  HER2 negative breast cancer with 0–3 posi-\n\ntive lymph nodes \n\nMaterials and methods\n395 consecutive female patients with primary

[19]  breast cancer were enrolled in the\n\nstudy  All patients underwent primary therapy at the interdisciplinary breast center of Klini-\n\nkum rechts der Isar  Technische Universita¨t Mu¨nchen  Munich  Germany \n\nRegarding treatment recommendations case discussions were held during an interdisciplin-\n\nary tumor conference for all patients  The results of the uPA/PAI-1 test and the EPclin were\n\nknown to the tumor conference  Additionally a second and third conference was held  One\n\nconference accounted for all patient information but the EPclin and uPA/ PAI-1 results \n\nanother conference was blinded to the EPclin result but was aware of uPA/PAI-1 results \n\nConsequently three separate treatment recommendations were generated \n\nAssessment of the EPclin score\nThe EPclin score is a second generation genomic expression assay calculating risk of recur-\n\nrence in primary HR positive  HER2 negative breast cancer  A thorough report of the key facts\n\nof the EPclin score is reported elsewhere [16]  In sum  the EndoPredict assay  Sividon Diag-\n\nnostics GmbH  Cologne  Germany  analyses the expression levels of eight genes of interest\n\n BIRC5  UBE2C  DHCR7  RBBP8

distant recurrence are 5 and 3 3 respectively [16] \n\nAssessment of uPA and PAI-1 levels\nDirectly after surgery the tumor tissue was transferred to the pathologist laboratory for further\n\nprocessing into tumor extracts as described previously [21]  In brief  in order to determine\n\nuPA and PAI-1 levels Femtelle ELISA assay  Sekisui Diagnostics LLC  formerly American\n\nDiagnostic Inc  Stamford  CT  USA  and Pierce protein assay  Rockford  IL  were used  The\n\nvalidated cutoff points were utilized  patients with low concentrations of uPA  < 3 ng/mg of\n\nprotein  and PAI-1  <14 ng/mg of protein  were categorized as low risk  pateints with high\n\nlevels of uPA    3 ng/mg of protein  or/and PAI-1   14 ng/mg of protein  were categorized\n\nas high

respect to feasibility  risk stratification and influ-\n\nence on adjuvant therapy recommendation in endocrine sensitive  HER2- negative early breast\n\ncancer \n\nEPclin resulted significantly more frequently in a change of therapy recommendation than\n\nthe uPA/PAI-1 test  46% vs  24%  The change was in almost all cases abstention from recom-\n\nmendation of adjuvant CTX  45% vs  22%  so that recommendation of adjuvant CTX was\n\nabandoned twice as often by EPclin compared to the uPA/PAI-1 test  EPclin is therefore\n\nclearly superior to the uPA/PAI-1 test with respect to possible avoidance of adjuvant CTX \n\nThis is of paramount importance in clinical practice as implementation of EPclin could reduce\n\novertreatment and associated CTX-induced toxicities in the individual patient to a greater\n\nextent than uPA/PAI-1  Moreover substantial treatment-related healthcare costs could be fur-\n\nther reduced  Blank et al analyzed the health economic effect of EPclin in the population of\n\n1619 patients of the ABCSG 6/8 trials and determined that EPclin-based risk stratification\n\npresents a cost-effective tool for reducing CTX-associated costs [23] \n\nEPclin and uPA/PAI-1 have been validated for risk stratification of patients with endocrine\n\nsensitive early breast cancer and have been used already for some time in clinical routine  The\n\nrisk stratification performed in the context of the present study by uPA/PAI-1  46% low risk \n\n54% high risk  and EPclin  63% low risk  37% high risk  is consistent with published data from\n\nother retrospective  monocentric surveys  recently  Kolben et al reported about 381 intermedi-\n\nate-risk patients  of which 45% were uPA/PAI-1 low risk and 55% were uPA/PAI-1 high risk\n\n[24]  Mu¨ller et al report a EPclin low-risk group of 48% in a cohort of 167 defined tumors in\n\nwhich smaller tumors  pT1a/b  were under-represented compared to the present study [20] \n\nFig 2  EPclin shows a

classifica-\n\ntion in 68% of the cases [25] \n\nOur study provides for the first time data for direct comparison of risk stratification by\n\nuPA/PAI-1 and EPclin  In 77  41%  of 190 cases in which both tests were performed  the\n\nresults were discrepant  i e  different risk allocations resulted depending on the used test result \n\nThe discrepancy and the only moderate correlation between the two tests can be explained by\n\nthe different test characteristics  EPclin determines expression levels of genes associated with\n\ntumor cell proliferation and hormone receptor activity at the RNA level  The uPA/PAI-1 assay\n\ndetermines the uPA and PAI-1 content of tumor tissue at the protein level  UPA and PAI-1 are\n\nresponsible for pericellular mechanisms such as localized proteolysis  cell adhesion and migra-\n\ntion [26]  Unlike PAI-1  uPA has been attributed with a proliferation-promoting role  similar\n\nto that of a growth factor [27]  This may explain why we could demonstrate a moderate corre-\n\nlation between EP and uPA values  r = 0 385  while EPclin and PAI-1 values correlated only\n\nvery weakly  r = 0 179  The measured differences in the strength of correlation between\n\nEPclin or uPA/PAI-1 and the conventional histopathological prognostic parameter of grading\n\nalso suggest that the two tests map distinct biological properties of the tumor  It is also likely\n\nthat inclusion of the clinicopathological parameters tumor size and nodal status provides\n\nFig 3  Moderate correlation between EPclin and uPA  Relations are quantified by Spearman’s

whom an Oncotype DX recurrence score was\n\navailable  With 76%  only a moderate concordance of the two gene expression tests was dem-\n\nonstrated  The authors attribute this to the different weighting of the various biological proper-\n\nties of the tumor measured at the gene expression level [28] \n\nEPclin was clearly superior to uPA/PAI-1 with regard to feasibility in clinical practice \n\nEPclin could be determined in all 395 tumor samples included in the study  In contrast \n\nuPA/PAI-1 test was performed in only 190  48%  of the tumor samples  Similar data on limited\n\nfeasibility of the uPA/PAI-1 test can be found in a French study in which the uPA/PAI-1 test\n\nwas feasible in only 57% of a total of 285 tumors [29]  In a retrospective study by Mu¨ller et al \n\ntest feasibility for EPclin was 99%  which is similar to that in our study [20]  The difference in\n\ntest feasibility in our study is due to the fact that the uPA/PAI-1 test can be performed exclu-\n\nsively on fresh tissue  Tissue for the uPA/PAI-1 test must be collected immediately after sur-\n\ngery as a frozen section  About 50 mg of tumor tissue is required for protein determination \n\nwhich makes the test often not feasible for small tumors  Furthermore  fresh tissue collection\n\nin clinical routine is far more demanding than collection of FFPE tissue samples  In

\nThe novelty of this study is that two different prognostic tests were used prospectively in\n\nclinical routine  and that both test results and therapy recommendations were compared with\n\neach other  Thus  it could be shown that the existing discrepancy in the test results indeed\n\nleads to a significant change in the recommendation of adjuvant therapy  Use of the EPclin\n\ntest is significantly more likely to result in refraining from adjuvant CTX  Limitations of this\n\nstudy include the unicentric and non-randomized design and the lack of data on the relapse\n\nfree survival of the patients  It is of paramount clinical relevance to determine the effect of\n\navoidance of CTX on the prognosis of this patient population  Data on disease-free and metas-\n\ntasis-free survival is being collected prospectively in the course of a follow-up study and will be\n\navailable in near future \n\nConclusion\nIn summary  our study shows that EPclin is superior to uPA/PAI-1 with respect to feasibility\n\nand impact on recommendation of adjuvant therapy  Unlike the logistically more demanding\n\nuPA/PA-1  EPclin is feasible in routine clinical practice and results in substantial avoidance of\n\nadjuvant CTX in endocrine-sensitive  HER2-negative breast cancer  Prospective evaluation of\n\ndistant relapse free survival of patients for whom therapy decision has been influenced by\n\nEPclin is ongoing \n\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization  Johannes Ettl  Evelyn Klein  Stefan Paepke  Christoph Petry  Katja Specht \n\nMarion Kiechle \n\nData curation  Johannes

clinical and pathological parameters  such as tumour\nsize  grade and nodal status  to make decisions on adjuvant treatments for breast\ncancer  However  therapeutic decisions based on these features tend to vary due to\ntheir subjectivity  Computational and mathematical algorithms were developed using\nclinical outcome data from breast cancer registries  such as Adjuvant  Online and NHS\nPREDICT  More recently  assessments of molecular profiles have been applied in the\ndevelopment of better prognostic tools \n\nMethods  Based on the available literature on online registry-based tools

freely avail-\n\nable online  making them attractive in resource-constrained healthcare settings  They\n\nhelp clinicians to assess an individual’s risk of developing recurrent disease and/or\n\ndying within 10 years  and have the potential to guide decisions regarding adjuvant and\n\nneoadjuvant therapy [3  4] \n\nThe deepening understanding of breast cancer has been used to significantly improve\n\nthese types of prognostic tool  A particularly influential discovery was the characterisa-\n\ntion of breast cancer as a heterogeneous group of neoplastic processes arising from the\n\nductal or lobular epithelium rather than a single disease with a variable ER and HER2\n\nexpression  It enabled the development of better prognostic tools based on assessing\n\nmolecular profiles  Examples of such assays include Blueprint [5] Mammaprint [6] \n\nOncotype DX [7]  prediction analysis of microarray 50  PAM50  [8  9] and EndoPredict\n\n EP  [10]  The EndoPredict Clinical  EpClin  assay is a composite of standard patho-\n\nlogical parameters and molecular profiling scores which has been found to provide su-\n\nperior prognostic information [11]  These assays have changed the landscape of clinical\n\noncology and allowed clinicians to make therapeutic decisions based on the molecular\n\nmachinery of the tumour and data derived from randomised controlled trials \n\nThese commercially available molecular scores have not only been found to be cost-\n\neffective  they have become less expensive over the past few years  Despite this  their\n\ncost may be an issue in resource-poor settings  An analysis by Reed et al  suggests that\n\nthe initial outlay on genomic assays are offset by future gains in quality-adjusted patient\n\nyears [12]  However  cost remains a significant consideration \n\nIn this article  we shall discuss the literature on the online tools mentioned above\n\nwith a view to evaluating whether they could be valid and accurate alternatives to gen-\n\nomic and molecular profiling of the individual breast tumour in aiding therapeutic de-\n\ncisions in the era of personalized precision medicine  particularly in patients with early\n\nER-positive breast cancer \n\nOnline prediction tools\n\nThe online tools referred to earlier primarily use clinicopathological variables and can-\n\ncer registry data as the basis of risk prediction  The clinical pathological variables used\n\ninclude age  tumour size and grade  mode of detection  number of lymph nodes in-\n\nvolved  ER status  HER2 status  Ki67 status and type of chemotherapy [13]  The\n\nstrengths and weaknesses of these tools draw from the design and limitations of the\n\nregistry data on which they are based \n\nAdjuvant  Online\n\nThe baseline risk estimation for Adjuvant  Online was derived from the SEER  surveil-\n\nlance  epidemiology and end results  database program  which is a collation of nine da-\n\ntabases covering 14% of the US population [14]  The SEER database specifically\n\nexcludes patients under the age of 35 and over the age of 59 [15] and has limited infor-\n\nmation on the socio-economic status of subject  There have been concerns regarding\n\nthe quality of the data about cause of death [16  17] \n\nThe database does not include information regarding the benefits of adjuvant trastu-\n\nzumab  thereby reducing the utility of Adjuvant  Online in clinical decisions about\n\nHER2-positive disease treatment [16  17]  This deficiency of Adjuvant  Online with\n\nWazir et al  Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters   2017  22 20 Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\nregards to HER2-positive disease has significant implications for the prediction of\n\nmetastatic spread  In a recent in vitro study using murine models  the HER2 status of\n\ncells predicted the response to progesterone-induced signalling  with HER2-deficient\n\ncells being more likely to migrate and HER2-enriched cells tending towards increased\n\nproliferation [18]  This recent evidence underlines the importance of HER2 in predict-\n\ning prognosis and highlights the significance of this inherent shortcoming in online\n\ncancer registry-based prognostic tools \n\nAdjuvant  Online tends to overestimate the number of patients at high risk  Cardoso\n\net al  found that Adjuvant  Online incorrectly classified 23% of patients as high clinical\n\nrisk when Oncotype DX classified them as low genomic risk  [19] \n\nIn a population-based validation study  Olivotto et al  suggest that in patients under\n\n35 years of age and who test positive for lymphovascular invasion  Adjuvant  Online\n\nwould overestimate survival  It was also found that Adjuvant  Online tends to overesti-\n\nmate the survival rates of younger women with ER-positive breast cancer [3] and that it\n\noverestimated the added value of chemotherapy for older patients [20–22]  The validity\n\nof the predictive score calculated by Adjuvant  Online was deemed weak in the\n\nclinician-based validation [23]  Predictions on loco-regional relapse and distant metas-\n\ntases may vary greatly  making it difficult to make clear recommendations for adjuvant\n\ntreatment [24]  This is reflected in two studies that suggest that when patients are in-\n\nvolved in a discussion to decide on adjuvant chemotherapy  they are less likely to\n\nchoose chemotherapy if using Adjuvant  Online [25  26] \n\nThe ethnic variation in the data on which these online tools are based seriously af-\n\nfects the generalisability of these online tools  The SEER database is representative of\n\nthe usual US population in terms of age  sex and ethnic distribution  However  the eth-\n\nnic mix of the US population is different from that of England and Wales \n\nNHS PREDICT\n\nThe NHS PREDICT online tool is based on a cancer registry database of 5694 patients\n\nin the UK [4]  Unfortunately  independent investigators have raised concerns regarding\n\nthe quality of the cancer registry data [27  28]  Joishy et al  identified the lack of educa-\n\ntion of medical professionals and imprecision and inconsistency in medical records as\n\nfactors negatively impacting the reliability of the data  and stated that insufficient time \n\npersonnel and finances had been allocated to ensure high quality [29]  The NHS PRE-\n\nDICT tool does not provide any estimate of local relapse and does not consider mortal-\n\nity due to causes other than breast cancer in its survival estimate  Therefore  a total\n\nreliance on the NHS PREDICT online tool may deprive patients  particularly those with\n\nsmall  biologically aggressive cancers  of the benefit of chemotherapy [24] \n\nIn our unpublished audit of 120 patients who underwent genomic profiling using\n\nboth the EP Clin score and NHS PREDICT calculation  the disconcordance rate was\n\nsignificantly high  43%  If we relied solely on NHS PREDICT  a significant proportion\n\nof patients with small  node-negative tumours would not have received chemotherapy \n\ndespite needing adjuvant therapy according to the EP Clin score \n\nWong et al  found that NHS PREDICT substantially overestimates survival in very\n\nyoung patients with breast cancer and those receiving chemotherapy [30] \n\nAs with Adjuvant  Online  the ethnic mix of the outcome data used to develop NHS\n\nPREDICT may not be generalisable to more diverse metropolitan areas in the UK  such\n\nas London and Birmingham \n\nWazir et al  Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters   2017  22 20 Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\nIn summary  online prediction tools continue to be of value as free adjuncts to thera-\n\npeutic decision-making  However  the use of these tools should be tempered with rec-\n\nognition of the inherent biases of the underlying databases and the well-documented\n\nlimitations of these algorithms  such as overestimation of the benefits of chemotherapy\n\nin certain patient groups  underestimation of the benefits of chemotherapy in patients\n\nwith small  biologically aggressive tumours  lack of generalisability to more diverse pop-\n\nulations  and lack of standardisation in clinical utility \n\nGenomic assays\n\nThe use of genomic assays in human breast cancer has been endorsed by the National\n\nInstitute for Clinical Excellence  NICE  and the American Society of Clinical Oncology\n\n ASCO  among others [31]  Several histological and molecular markers are used to\n\nidentify patients with breast cancer at the highest risk of recurrence  which also means\n\ntumours with the highest degree of sensitivity to chemotherapy [11] \n\nThe most established example of a genomic assay score is the recurrence score  RS \n\nwhich is based on an Oncotype DX 21-gene assay panel  The RS ranges from 1 to 100 \n\nand is stratified into low risk  below 18  intermediate risk  18 to 30  and high risk  over\n\n30  RS was the first such score to be included in NICE and ASCO guidelines [31  32] \n\nEndoPredict  EP  is a 15-point score based on an 8-gene panel which assigns patients\n\nto high- and low-risk groups  below and above 5  respectively  The reliability of the\n\nscore is increased by incorporating clinical parameters  tumour size and nodal status \n\nin a score that has been named EndoPredict Clinical  EpClin  EP and EpClin have been\n\nshown to provide more prognostic information than RS  in part due to the combination\n\nof genomic data with nodal status and tumour size  The absence of an intermediate risk\n\ngroup in EP makes decision-making more straightforward than with RS [33]  EpClin\n\nprovides reliable information about the benefit of chemotherapy by combining molecu-\n\nlar signatures with clinicopathological variables and data derived from randomised con-\n\ntrolled trials [34] \n\nMammaprint is the oldest available test  consisting of a 70-gene assay that stratifies\n\nthe patients into high- and low-risk groups [19]  A further 80-gene panel called Blue-\n\nprint was developed for more accurate typing of breast cancer  5  It is meant to be\n\nused in conjunction with Mammaprint  Mammaprint is still waiting for external valid-\n\nation in the MINDACT trial  the results of which were presented at ASCO [35] \n\nPAM50 is a 50-gene assay that identifies the breast cancer subtype  and generates a\n\nrisk of recurrence score  ROR  The ROR is a 100-point scale that stratifies patients\n\ninto low risk of recurrence  intermediate risk and high risk  PAM50 was validated in\n\nthe ATAC and ABCSG-8 trials  where it was found to be superior to immunohisto-\n\nchemistry and RS in ER-positive node-negative breast cancer patients receiving endo-\n\ncrine therapy [8  9] \n\nThe efficacy of genomic assays is a testament to the milestones achieved in the un-\n\nderstanding of cancer biology and the recent recognition of the heterogeneity of breast\n\ncancer as a disease \n\nInternet-based mathematical and computational algorithms provide physicians and pa-\n\ntients with useful information regarding prognosis and the benefits of systemic therapy \n\nThey are particularly valuable in resource-constrained international healthcare  However \n\nWazir et al  Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters   2017  22 20 Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\ntheir inherent limitations  which are related to the conceptual design  methodology and\n\ndata quality  make these decision aids insufficiently robust to be used as an alternative to\n\nmolecular profiling of the primary tumour in the modern era of personalised cancer care\n\nand precision medicine \n\nEarly breast cancer is currently considered a systemic disease and a complex ecosys-\n\ntem with behaviour determined by complex genetic and molecular signatures of the\n\ntumour cells  mammary stem cells  microenvironment and host immune system rather\n\nthan an anatomical neoplastic process that progresses locally and then spreads to re-\n\ngional lymph nodes and other organs during tumour progression  Therefore  we antici-\n\npate that molecular profiling will continue to evolve and expand to include the tumour\n\nmicroenvironment  cancer stem cells and host immune system  in addition to the pri-\n\nmary tumour  to further refine therapeutic decisions and optimise clinical outcomes\n\n[36] \n\nHowever  it would be prudent to closely follow developments in this field  as no sin-\n\ngle multi-gene assay is emerging as standard and no one technology is uniformly ac-\n\ncepted  Continued studies for validation and reproducibility of genomic tests are\n\nneeded to better understand their limitations and to further increase their utility in\n\nmaking treatment decisions in the early stages of breast cancer \n\nAcknowledgements\nNot

expression or subcellular localiza-\ntion contributes to progression in population-based settings \n\nMethods\nWe examined BRCA1 expression and subcellular localization in invasive breast cancer tis-\nsues from an ethnically diverse sample of 286 patients and 36 normal breast tissue controls \nTwo different methods were used to label breast cancer tissues for BRCA1   1  Dual immu-\nnofluoresent staining with BRCA1 and cytokeratin 8/18 and  2  immunohistochemical stain-\ning using the previously validated MS110 mouse monoclonal antibody  Slides were\nvisualized and quantified using the VECTRA Automated Multispectral Image Analysis Sys-\ntem and InForm software \n\nResults\nBRCA1 staining was more intense in normal than in invasive breast tissue for both cyto-\nplasmic  p 200  was more\n\nlikely in nuclear than cytoplasmic compartments  15% versus 4%  respectively   Fig 4B and 4C \n\nIHC staining  IHC and IF staining scores were significantly

Despite the\n\nweak IHC positivity and lower IHC H-scores compared with the IF staining  similar patterns of\n\ndistribution and levels of expression were observed using the two methods  Fig 5D–5G \n\nAssociations with patient and tumor characteristics\nIF staining  Associations of BRCA1 expression with patient  clinical and tumor character-\n\nistics were broadly similar between compartments

transcrip-\n\ntional activity even in the absence of BRCA1 mutations  However  further verification of this\n\nmechanism and its implications in familial and sporadic breast cancer remain to be explored \n\nWe also found that Her2 positive tumors are significantly associated with high BRCA1\n\nexpression  Accordingly  Luminal B and Her2-enriched molecular subtypes had higher\n\nBRCA1 scores than Luminal A and triple negative tumors  Previous studies have reported low\n\nHER2 amplification amongst BRCA1 mutation carriers who conceivably have impaired\n\nBRCA1 expression and/or function [33]  These findings might indicate a connection between\n\nBRCA1 and Her2 pathways in breast cancer that is similar to what have been shown for\n\nBRCA1 and ER except that the mechanistic link between BRCA1 and Her2 is less understood \n\nOne of the significant and novel findings in this study is the strong positive correlation\n\nbetween BRCA1 and AR expression  AR has been reported to be expressed in 60–90% of spo-\n\nradic breast cancer and is considered an independent prognostic factor of better outcome in\n\nER-positive patients [34]  AR has been shown to be expressed in 80% of BRCA2 mutated\n\nbreast cancer as opposed to only 30% of BRCA1 mutated breast cancer [35]  To our knowl-\n\nedge  this study is one of only two studies  Rakha et al [17]  that measured the association\nbetween AR and BRCA1 protein expression in a population-based study of breast cancer\n\npatients regardless of BRCA1 mutation status  i e  both hereditary and sporadic cases  Park\n\net al  [36] demonstrated that BRCA1 is a coactivator of AR and might directly modify AR sig-\nnaling and subsequently AR autoregulated expression in vitro  Furthermore  other studies\nhave demonstrated that AR signaling stimulates the expression of tumor suppressor genes\n\nsuch as PTEN  resulting in cell growth inhibition and activation of p53-mediated apoptosis in\n\nbreast cancer [37]  Whether BRCA1 is upstream or downstream to AR signaling is not\n\ncompletely understood  Yet  the strong positive correlation between AR and BRCA1 should\n\ninspire future studies to explore AR signaling as a therapeutic target in familial breast cancers\n\nthat have altered BRCA1 expression \n\nTable 7   Continued \nVariable Nuclear Cytoplasmic\n\nLow  %  High  %  P-value Low  %  High  %  P-value\nHigh

cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0184385 September 1  2017 20 / 24\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important role for BRCA1 expression and subcellular localization in breast cancer pro-\n\ngression is indicated by its loss and altered distribution in a large proportion of non-familial\n\nbreast cancers  Yet  the speed and low price of current BRCA1 mutation screening make it a\n\nmore popular method to assess BRCA1 status in breast cancer than measuring the actual\n\nexpression and subcellular distribution of BRCA1 in histological specimens  However  BRCA1\n\nmutation screening is helpful only for individuals who receive a clear-cut result  pathogenic\n\nmutation with a known function or negative for any mutation  and not for others who have\n\nBRCA1 mutations with uncertain significance  Our data indicated that BRCA1 expression and\n\nsubcellular localization might stand as an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer\n\nwhich is supported by similar findings from previous studies [17  23  38]  However  this\n\nresearch would benefit greatly from larger population-based studies that might encourage\n\nhealth care workers to incorporate BRCA1 staining in breast cancer prognosis algorithm \n\nMajor strengths of this study are that it is a population-based study of an ethnically diverse\n\nsample of breast cancer patients and therefore may be generalizable to an urban population \n\nAnother strength was the availability of detailed demographic and clinical data  Also  using dual\n\nIF technique and automated digital image analysis allowed to segment tissue compartments\n\n epithelium vs  stromal  and subcellular compartments  nucleus versus cytoplasm  and thus\n\nenabled accurate per cell quantification of BRCA1 defined within multiple tissue types includ-\n\ning epithelium and stroma  It also allowed the quantitation of weakly expressing and overlap-\n\nping biomarkers within cytoplasm and nuclei which cannot be identified by the naked eye \n\nensuring consistency of scoring and minimizing manual error  The strong correlation between\n\nthe dual IF staining and the IHC staining using the widely used MS110 antibody validate the\n\nformer method as an alternative approach that exhibits a stronger signal in the epithelial com-\n\npartment and avoids contamination by stromal non-specific positivity  Yet  the cross-sectional\n\nnature of this study hinders the ability to assess temporal aspects of the observed associations \n\nThere are also limitations in the tissue microarray technique used in this and other studies  Tis-\n\nsue stained might not be representative of the tumor due to tumor heterogeneity  However  to\n\navoid this  TMA blocks were constructed in triplicates  each containing one sample from a\n\ndifferent region of the tumor  Also  many groups have shown excellent concordance between\n\ntissue microarray spots and whole sections in IHC studies of multiple tumor types [39  40] \n\nFinally  information about BRCA1 mutation status in the study subjects is not available which\n\nwould have strengthened the validity of our current findings  Nevertheless  the main purpose of\n\nthe current study was to examine the expression and localization of BRCA1 protein and to\n\nassess its prognostic value  in an ethnically diverse sample of breast cancer patients that repre-\n\nsents the major racial/ethnic groups in Chicago  independent of BRCA1 gene mutations \n\nIn conclusion  an important role for the BRCA1 protein in breast cancer progression is\n\nindicated by its reduction or altered subcellular distribution in a large proportion of breast\n\ncancer patients  Correlations between reduced BRCA1 expression and some aggressive tumor\n\nfeatures in our study were  to some extent  similar to those described in previous studies of\n\nfamilial cancers with BRCA1 germline mutation [5]  Research on a more basic level is required\n\nto understand the underlying genetic variants that different BRCA1 assays are identifying  and\n\nwhether commercially available antibodies may select preferentially for proteins derived from\n\ncytoplasmic variants or

imaging agents and effective small-\nanimal models to test them  The purpose of this study was to evaluate\n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate as a mammary microcalcification-targeting PET\n\nimaging agent  using an ideal rat model  Our long-term goal is to develop\n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate for the detection and noninvasive differentiation\n\nof malignant versus benign breast tumors with PET  Methods  DOTA-\nalendronate was synthesized  radiolabeled with 64Cu  and administered\n\nto normal or tumor-bearing aged  female  retired breeder Sprague–\nDawley rats for PET imaging  Mammary tissues were subsequently la-\n\nbeled and imaged with light  confocal  and electron microscopy to verify\n\nmicrocalcification targeting specificity of DOTA-alendronate and eluci-\n\ndate the histologic and ultrastructural characteristics of the microcalcifi-\ncations in different mammary tumor types  Tumor uptake  biodistribution \n\nand dosimetry studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy and\n\nsafety of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate  Results  64Cu-DOTA-alendronate\nwas radiolabeled with a 98% yield  PET imaging using aged  female \n\nretired breeder rats showed specific binding of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate\n\nin mammary glands and mammary tumors  The highest uptake of 64Cu-\n\nDOTA-alendronate was in malignant tumors and the lowest uptake in\nbenign tumors and normal mammary tissue  Confocal analysis with car-\n\nboxyfluorescein-alendronate confirmed the microcalcification binding\n\nspecificity of alendronate derivatives  Biodistribution studies revealed tis-\n\nsue alendronate concentrations peaking within the first hour  then de-\ncreasing over the next 48 h  Our dosimetric analysis demonstrated a\n64Cu effective dose within the acceptable range for clinical PET imaging\n\nagents and the potential for translation into human patients Conclusion \n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate is a promising PET imaging agent for the sen-\nsitive and specific detection of mammary tumors as well as the differen-\n\ntiation of malignant versus benign tumors based on absolute labeling\n\nuptake \n\nKey Words  64Cu-DOTA-alendronate  bisphosphonate  microcalcification \nbreast

chances\n\nof remission and survival by allowing treatment before the cancer\n\ncan progress or metastasize  Currently  the most widely used form\n\nof breast cancer screening is mammography  which uses low-energy\n\nradiography to visualize the microarchitecture of the breast to detect\n\nmasses or microcalcifications  which may indicate cancer  2  Al-\n\nthough mammography remains the preferred screening modality for\n\nbreast cancer in the general population  3  over the last decade con-\n\ntroversy has grown surrounding the use of mammograms  Numerous\n\nstudies indicate that while mammography detects some cancers that\n\nwould otherwise go unnoticed for periods of time  the resulting overall\n\ndecrease in mortality rates of women is minuscule  4  Because of a\n\ndiscouragingly high false-positive rate  mammograms cause consider-\n\nable stress and lead to a high number of unnecessary  invasive bi-\n\nopsies  with only 10%–40% actually demonstrating cancer  3 \nThe principal aspect of a mammogram used to interpret areas of\n\npotential cancer is the presence of microcalcifications  5  There are\n\nmany types of microcalcifications found in breast tissue  They can be\n\ncomposed of varying combinations and concentrations of oxalate\n\nand phosphate with calcium magnesium  sodium  potassium  iron \n\nand zinc ions  6  however  mammograms can detect only certain\n\ntypes that are sufficiently dense to be seen on radiography  The most\n\ncommon type of microcalcification in normal tissue and benign\n\nlesions is calcium oxalate  and the most common type in malignant\n\nlesions is hydroxyapatite  1 7 8  Recent studies show that the size \n\nshape  distribution  and most of all composition of microcalcifica-\n\ntions are significantly correlated with tumor type  8–10  In this\n\nstudy  we sought to exploit this observation using a bisphosphonate \n\nwhich has a high affinity for hydroxyapatite and other calcium crys-\n\ntals  11  including those not visible by mammography  as a sensitive\n\ntargeting agent for these microcalcifications  The ability to predict\n\nmicrocalcification type before biopsy would significantly increase\n\nthe specificity and utility of breast cancer screening \nBisphosphonates are a class of drugs typically prescribed to\n\nprevent the loss of bone mass in diseases such as osteoporosis \n\nOver the past 5 y  clinicians have observed that women taking\n\nbisphosphonates have improved breast cancer survival rates and\n\nchemotherapy efficacy  12 13  As a result  many clinicians now\n\nadminister bisphosphonates to supplement chemotherapy regimens\n\nReceived Jan  26  2017  revision accepted Apr  11  2017 \n*For correspondence or reprints contact  John E  Shively  Department

as\nbone-targeting agents for PET imaging of bone disease  they have not\nbeen investigated as human breast cancer PET imaging agents  14 \nAlthough current established PET imaging agents such as 18F-FDG\n\nand 18F-NaF are effective for detection of many cancer types  in-\ncluding breast cancer metastases  they are not effective in detecting\nprimary breast cancer  18F-FDG is not sufficiently sensitive to dis-\ntinguish small  in situ malignancies  15  and 18F-NaF indirectly\nvisualizes bony tumors with bone reaction–dependent uptake and\nis thus not effective at labeling nonactive  soft-tissue structures such\nas calcifications in breast tumors  16  This lack of efficacy in\nestablished PET imaging agents further reinforces the need for an\neffective breast cancer PET imaging agent \nAlthough several bisphosphonates are used clinically to treat\n\nosteoporosis  we chose alendronate for this study because of its\naccessible amino group suitable for conjugation chemistry and its\nrelatively high affinity for calcium phosphate crystals compared with\nother bisphosphonates  17  The commonly used and clinically rel-\nevant chelating agent DOTA was chosen because we have used it\nextensively and successfully to radiolabel DOTA antibodies with\n64Cu for translational clinical trials  18 19  Radioisotopes for PET\nimaging are typically selected on the basis of the half-life of the\ncarrier molecule  However  with alendronate having a 12-y half-life\n 20  64Cu was chosen because of its intermediate half-life of 12 7 h \nwhich permits PET scans up to 48 h after injection while still main-\ntaining acceptable dosimetry to the patient  This collectively led to\nour selection of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate as our PET imaging agent \nOne of the major hurdles to the improvement of breast cancer\n\nimaging has been the lack of appropriate animal models that\naccurately recapitulate both the normal and the pathologic conditions\nseen in human breast tissue  Female rats have 6 pairs of mammary\nglands  with 2 of these pairs  thoracic and abdominal  being large and\ndiscrete  In contrast to mice  with an adult size of 300–500 g  rats are\nlarge enough for structures  such as microcalcifications  to be differ-\nentiated by PET within a mammary gland  It has been reported that\naging rats develop microcalcifications in their mammary glands  21 \nand  more recently  that they can even be implanted with  or stimu-\nlated to grow  mammary calcifications  22  Here  we report the use\nof aged  female  retired breeder Sprague–Dawley rats as models for\nboth normal and pathologic human breast tissue microcalcifications\nwithout any artificial microcalcification growth induction  Normal\nand benign tumor conditions were created without any experimental\nmanipulation  and malignant tumors were induced with the carcin-\nogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea  which reliably produces mammary\ncarcinomas in rats \nUsing the calcification binding properties of alendronate  and our\n\nrat model of human breast cancer  we synthesized DOTA-alendronate\nand administered 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate  Fig  1  to normal or tu-\nmor-bearing aged  female  retired breeder Sprague–Dawley rats for\nPET imaging  We subsequently imaged mammary tissues with light \nconfocal  and electron microscopy to verify the microcalcification-\ntargeting specificity of DOTA-alendronate  Tumor uptake  biodistri-\nbution  and dosimetry studies were also performed to evaluate the\nefficacy and safety of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate with the goal of de-\nveloping 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate for the detection and noninvasive\ndifferentiation of malignant versus benign breast tumors with PET \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nAnimal Models\n\nFemale  retired breeder  minimum  5 litters  Sprague–Dawley rats\n 250–500

mg/kg\nintraperitoneal injection of NMU  N-nitroso-N-methylurea  to produce\n\nintraductal carcinomas  23  which took approximately 3–9 mo to form \nTwenty rats were allowed to age until they developed spontaneous\n\nfibroadenomas  and 14 of the 20 rats developed fibroadenomas over\na period of 1 y  Thirty rats were used for tumor-free controls and\n\ncomparative dosimetry  All animal procedures were performed and\nconducted in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of\n\nLaboratory Animal Care International–accredited  specific pathogen-\nfree facility in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use\n\nCommittee–approved procedures and the Guide for the Care and\nUse of Laboratory Animals  24 \n\nRadiolabeling\n\nDOTA-alendronate was dissolved in 0 1 M ammonium acetate  pH\n\n7 0  and incubated with 64Cu at a ratio of 37 MBq per mg of DOTA-\nalendronate  2 3 · 1010 MBq/mol  total of 74 MBq  volume  200 mL  for\n30 min at 43 C  then chased with an excess of 1 mM diethylenetriamine\npentaacetic acid and incubated at room temperature for 15 min  Radio-\n\nlabeling efficiency was more than 98% by instant thin-layer chromatog-\nraphy with a 0 9% NaCl running buffer  Doses  37–74 MBq per rat  were\n\ndiluted to 200 mL with 1% human serum albumin in saline \n\nPET Imaging\n\nPET scans were acquired with an Inveon microPET/CT scanner\n Siemens Medical Solutions  For dynamic PET scans  rats were\n\nanesthetized with 2%–4% isoflurane in oxygen  urinary catheterized \nplaced on the PET scanner  and injected with a single intravenous dose\n\nof 1 mg of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate per 250 g of body weight radiola-\nbeled at 37 MBq/mg DOTA-alendronate  2 3 · 1010 MBq/mol  in 1%\nhuman serum albumin–buffered saline through a tail vein catheter  For\nthe blocking study  the rat received 100 mg of nonradiolabeled DOTA-\n\nalendronate 1 h before a 1-mg imaging dose at 37 MBq/mg \n\nBiodistribution and Dosimetry\n\nRats were humanely euthanized at various time points for each\nexperiment  immediately after a PET scan  Tissues were in-\n\ndividually weighed  and then radioactivity was measured using an\nautomated g-counter  Wallac Wizard 3  Perkin Elmer  along with 3\n\ndose standards  For dosimetric experiments and analysis  8 rats\nwere used to collect a total of 34 PET images over 48 h  Supple-\n\nmental Table 1  supplemental

2017\n\n\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nHistology\n\nThe normal mammary gland histology of young versus aged\nretired breeder female rats is shown in Figure 2  Young rats showed\nfew  if any  microcalcifications within their mammary glands  how-\never  aged  retired breeder rats showed large  discrete  calcified crys-\ntals  microcalcifications  within the mammary ducts  With similar\nhistology  morphology  local distribution  along with the presence of\nmicrocalcifications  the mammary glands in these rats are a morpho-\nlogically similar recapitulation of human female breast tissue \n\nRat Tumor PET Imaging\n\nWhole-body PET images were obtained for 64Cu-DOTA-\nalendronate in normal  benign tumor–bearing  and malignant tumor–\nbearing aged female retired breeder rats  Representative whole-body\nPET images used for our region-of-interest calculations for normal \nbenign  and malignant conditions are shown in Figure 3  Uptake of\n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate was observed in all 3 types of mammary\ntissue  At 1 h after injection  the average region-of-interest SUV of\nnormal breast tissue was 0 30  0 074 percentage injected dose per\ngram [%ID/g]   n5 18  benign fibroadenoma was 0 74  0 18 %ID/g \n n5 6  and malignant carcinoma was 2 0  0 50 %ID/g  with tumor\nfoci reaching 4 4  1 1 %ID/g   n 5 4  The blood SUV at 1 h after\ninjection was between 0 6 and 0 8  0 15–0 20 %ID/g \nTo further test in vivo binding specificity  we performed a blocking\n\nstudy of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate by preadministering a 100-fold ex-\ncess  100 mg  of nonradiolabeled DOTA-alendronate 1 h before a 1-mg\nimaging dose of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate labeled at 37 MBq/mg\n Fig  4  This was done by imaging a rat with 64Cu-DOTA-\nalendronate and then using the same rat 7 d later for the blocking\nexperiment with unlabeled DOTA-alendronate  Another rat received 2\nequivalent doses of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate  1 wk apart  as a control\nto ensure that repeated administration itself did not affect binding\nlevels 1 wk later  data not shown  Repeated administration 1 wk\napart did not significantly affect mammary gland concentration  how-\never  blocking with unlabeled DOTA-alendronate resulted in a 39%\ndecrease in the SUV of mammary tissue  0 65 to 0 39 \n\nConfocal and Electron Microscopy of Microcalcifications\n\nFluorescent Confocal Microscopy  Fluorescent confocal micros-\ncopy was performed on tissues collected from normal and tumor-\nbearing rats after PET imaging and tissue biodistribution  Representative\nimages from 4 different physiologic and pathologic states of mammary\ntissue are shown in Figure 5  Mammary tissue from tumor-free  aged \nretired breeder rats contained numerous  discrete  crystal-like struc-\ntures stained specifically with FAM  carboxyfluorescein -alendronate\nwithin the lumen of mammary ducts  Amorphous  nonspecific\n\nmaterial was present within the ductal lumens of benign tumors \nwhich were also positive for FAM-alendronate  49 6-diamidino-2-\nphenylindole  and wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa555  Calcifications\nwere also visible within the lumen and between the glands of ma-\nlignant carcinomas  The material within the ductal lumen was non-\nspecifically stained and similar to that seen in benign tumors \nhowever  FAM-alendronate was highly specific to the small inter-\ncellular and intracellular crystalline structures with negligible back-\nground and nontarget staining  Kidneys containing nephroliths from\nthe same rats were also stained as a positive control to validate the\nsensitivity and specificity of alendronate for calcium crystals  Indi-\nvidual  nonmerged confocal images are shown in Supplemental\nFigure 1 \nElectron Microscopy and EDX  Energy-Dispersive X-Ray \n\nElemental Analysis  Tissue samples from normal rat mammary\ntissue and rats with benign or malignant tumors that were imaged with\n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate were prepared and processed for serial block\nface scanning electron microscopy  Two- and 3-dimensional scanning\nelectron microscopy images revealed osmiophilic structures consistent\nwith microcalcifications within the mammary ductal lumens of normal\nrats and in benign tumors  In malignant tumors  these structures were\nlocated within and between mammary gland cells  Fig  6  The Amira\n3D reconstruction software showed a diffuse distribution of these\nstructures throughout the neoplastic mammary tissue  Supplemental\nVideo 1  These results are consistent with our confocal microscopy\nobservations  EDX analysis of microcalcifications  Supplemental\nFigure 2  revealed that these microcalcifications were devoid of car-\nbon and contained high concentrations of calcium and oxygen \n\nFIGURE 2  Hematoxylin and

1375\n\n\n\nBiodistribution and Dosimetry of 64Cu-DOTA-Alendronate in\n\nNormal Rats\n\nThe biodistribution of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in aged  female \nretired breeder Sprague–Dawley rats is presented in Table 1 as the\n%ID/g and percentage injected dose per organ of all major tissues\nover 48 h  All values are decay-corrected to show the biologic\nactivity and pharmacokinetics of the drug  The 4 primary organs\nof concern  kidney  bone  blood  and liver  were also measured by\nregion-of-interest tracing of PET images at 34 time points for each\norgan  Supplemental Table 1  Figure 7 is a graphical reflection of\nthe pharmacokinetics of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in the 4 highest-\nconcentration tissues  demonstrating the trends over the first hour\nand over the next 48 h \nBlood  kidney  and urinary bladder levels peaked within the first\n\nfew minutes and then sharply fell as the drug was excreted through\nthe kidneys and voided from the bladder  At 1 h after injection  the\nbladder  kidneys  and stifle joint had the highest activity levels  Renal\nuptake was high and partially due to the known route of excretion of\nbisphosphonates  17  but also due to nephroliths  which are gener-\nally present and numerous in rats of this age  25  By 4 h  the\nclearance of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate through the kidneys and into\nthe urine was complete and bladder activity was undetectable after\nvoiding  However  the kidneys and stifle joints maintained elevated\norgan activity levels  All organ activity plateaued by 4 h after in-\njection and gradually decreased over the next 48 h  with the excep-\ntion of the liver  which gradually increased over 48 h \nUsing OLINDA/EXM  we calculated the relative dose of 64Cu-\n\nDOTA-alendronate for each organ of an adult  female human assum-\ning similar pharmacokinetics between humans and rats  Table 2 \nThe organs with the highest estimated dose were the large intestine\n due to its adjacency to the bladder  and the kidneys  through which\nthe drug is excreted  The organs with the lowest estimated doses\nwere the upper abdominal and thoracic organs  lungs  spleen  thy-\nmus  and thyroid  The estimated total effective dose for an adult\nwoman is 0 0418 mSv/MBq \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur use of aged  retired breeder  female rats as ideal models for\nevaluating breast cancer imaging techniques  especially those that\ninvolve microcalcifications  allowed us to study the potential for\n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in a natural  nonartificially induced model \nwhich accurately recapitulated the physiologic characteristics of hu-\nman breasts  These rats underwent multiple cycles of pregnancy and\nparturition-associated hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mammary\nglands with subsequent atrophy after weaning  This simulates\n\nnormal human pregnancy and the associated changes in breast\nphysiology  These rats also age rapidly and undergo menopause\nsimilar to women  26  Therefore  throughout their lives  these rats\nunderwent many of the same physiologic events as human women \nOur findings that their mammary tissues  including discrete micro-\ncalcifications  are similar to those seen in humans indicate that\naged  retired breeder  female rats are a useful model for evaluating\nbreast imaging techniques \nRadiolabeling of DOTA-alendronate with 64Cu was greater than\n\n98% by instant thin-layer chromatography at several specific activ-\nities  up to 37 MBq per mg of DOTA-alendronate  The images in\nFigure 3 demonstrate excellent specificity for microcalcifications\nwithin mammary tissue with minimal background uptake  Though\nthe mammary gland has a lower level of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate\naccumulation on a per gram basis than other organs such as kidney \nbone  liver  and bladder  this drug is intended as an imaging agent \nnot a targeted therapy agent  Therefore  as long as the off-target\nlevels are within a safe threshold  the most important characteristics\nof the drug are that it reaches the desired organ  here  the micro-\nstructures within the organ  and has low background labeling of\n\nFIGURE 5  Fluorescent confocal microscopy images of mammary glands in aged  retired

The blocking\nexperiment shown in Figure 4 suggests that the use of higher specific\nactivity may increase relative mammary tissue uptake and further\nreinforces the specificity of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate for mammary\nmicrocalcifications \n\n64Cu-DOTA-alendronate effectively targets mammary tissue and\nhas the potential to be a contrast agent for human breast PET im-\naging  PET images showed excellent contrast between mammary\nmicrocalcifications and surrounding soft tissue  This allowed the\nvisualization of individual large microcalcifications as well as clus-\nters of small microcalcifications  The predictive value of this agent\nlies in the observation that benign tumors have a 2- to 3-fold increase\nin 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate accumulation and that malignant tumors\nhave a roughly 7- to 15-fold increase over that of normal tissue  In\nvitro analysis of mammary tissue with FAM-alendronate demon-\nstrates the specificity of microcalcification binding using other\nalendronate derivatives  These experiments supported our hypothesis\nthat the targeting of this agent in mammary tissue was due  almost\nentirely  to its specific binding to calcified structures  and not due to\nnonspecific soft-tissue uptake \nIn this study  we observed that different tumor types had\n\nsignificantly different 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate uptake  and these\nvariations in uptake  and resultant PET image intensity  were\ninversely proportional to the radiopacity of these tumor types\non traditional mammograms  27 28  This finding indicates that\n\nthe disparities in observed PET image intensity are due to the\ndifferential binding of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate to the different\ntypes of calcifications present in these different mammary tu-\nmors  However  further studies are needed to determine whether\nthe differences in 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate binding are due to\nquantity  composition  or density of the microcalcifications in\nthese different tissue types  This observation reinforces the po-\ntential utility of this agent to be used in concert with  or as a\nfollow-up to  mammography to further aid in tumor differentia-\ntion based on the relationship between labeling intensity and\nmammogram radiopacity \nAs visible by hematoxylin and eosin and confocal histology  our\n\nrat mammary glands showed characteristics similar to their equiv-\nalent tissues in humans with normal mammary gland  demonstrating\noccasional variable-sized solid crystals  benign tumors showing\nnumerous  large  poorly defined crystals  and malignant carcino-\nmas having small  intracellular  and intercellular calcifications \nThis is further supported by electron microscopy  which shows the\nspatial distribution of these microcalcifications within and be-\ntween the ductal cells in a mammary duct in a carcinoma  These\nsmall calcifications are indicative of malignancy and are difficult\nto see with traditional hematoxylin and eosin  thus  fluorescent\nFAM-alendronate may be useful for histopathologic analysis of\nbiopsy sections to more accurately evaluate size  distribution  and\neven composition of microcalcifications  As seen in

• Ahrens et al  1377\n\n\n\nFAM-alendronate is highly specific for microcalcifications with\nlittle to no background fluorescence \nSerial block face scanning electron microscopy of microcalcifi-\n\ncations offers an interesting adjunct pathologic tool to observe the\nspatial distribution of microcalcifications within a tumor and use\nthat distribution to aid in diagnosis  As this new technology is used\nmore  we may start to use it to aid in the diagnosis of certain cancers\nbased on the 3-dimensional orientation of cells and structures in\ndifferent types of cancers \nPrevious studies have shown that unconjugated alendronate  like\n\nother bisphosphonates  is rapidly cleared from the blood  95% in\n6 h  and distributed to all major organs  Over the first 72 h after\nadministration  alendronate steadily dissociates from noncalcified\ntissues and is excreted unchanged in the urine  After 72 h \napproximately 50% of the initial dose is bound to bone where it has\na terminal half-life of 12 y  20  The biodistribution and pharmaco-\nkinetics of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in this study were consistent\nwith these published standards for unconjugated alendronate and\nshowed decreasing soft-tissue concentration and stable or increasing\nbone concentration over the first 72 h  Taken in conjunction with our\nfinding that more than 95% of 64Cu remains bound to DOTA-alendr-\nonate after 48 h in serum  Supplemental Fig  1  the addition of\nDOTA and 64Cu does not seem to have significantly affected the\npharmacokinetics of alendronate  One exception to the predicted\npharmacodynamics was the observation that liver values gradually\nrose over 48 h instead of falling like other tissues  This is likely due \nin part  to metabolism of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate both in the liver\nitself and in other organs  Once liberated from DOTA  free copper\nprimarily binds to albumin in the blood and is transported into he-\npatocytes where it is sequestered  29 \nTypical comparative dosimetric analyses use 3–6 animals per time\n\npoint for 3–7 time points  This equates to between 9 and 42 data\npoints  In the standardized dosimetry trial alone  we used 8 animals\nto collect between 27 and 36 values  depending on organ  for more\nthan 15 different time points  Analysis of dosimetry and biodistri-\nbution values in rats with OLINDA/EXM taking careful  conserva-\ntive considerations for every organ and detailed calculations for\nurinary clearance and bone marrow predicts a total effective human\n\ndose per unit injected activity of 0 0418 mSv/MBq  With an injected\ndose of 370 MBq  the resulting human dose for a PET examination\nwould be 15 5 mSV  This dose is within the acceptable range for\nclinical PET imaging agents and furthers the potential for translation\ninto human patients \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis research has effectively addressed the 2 major obstacles to\nthe advancement of breast cancer screening  the lack of specificity in\nimaging modalities and the absence of effective small-animal models\nto test them  We have demonstrated a compelling use for alendronate\nas a PET imaging agent  in the form of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate \nfor the detection and noninvasive differentiation of malignant and\nbenign mammary tumors  We also present the aged  retired breeder \nfemale Sprague–Dawley rat as an effective animal model that is\nuniquely suited for use in breast cancer imaging research  We have\nlikewise shown the utility of FAM-alendronate as a contrast agent for\nhistologic detection of calcium crystals in tissues by confocal mi-\ncroscopy  Our collective evidence including PET imaging  dosime-\ntry  biodistribution  and confocal and electron microscopy suggests\nthat 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate could be developed into a safe and\npowerful imaging agent for the detection and the noninvasive di-\nagnosis of human breast tumors containing microcalcifications \n\nTABLE 2\nEstimated Radiation

year approximately one and a half million new cases of breast cancer are registered world-\n\nwide [1]  While breast cancer mortality has substantially dropped over the past decades due to\n\nearlier detection and adjuvant therapies it is still difficult to tailor adjuvant chemotherapy for\n\nindividual patients  The risk of recurrence and indication to administer chemotherapy is largely\n\ndependent on the classical clinic-pathological prognostic factors of tumour size  involvement of\n\nlymph nodes  histologic grade  expression of hormone receptors  and human epidermal growth\n\nfactor receptor 2  HER2  amplification [2 3 4 5]  While these factors aid in the determination of\n\ndisease recurrence risk it remains a particular problem to identify those patients unlikely to ben-\n\nefit from adjuvant chemotherapy  It has been estimated that in early-stage breast cancer only\n\n15% of tumours will recur suggesting that based on current treatment guidelines many patients\n\nwill receive chemotherapy without benefit [2 3 4 6]  Given this dilemma there is great interest in\n\nthe diagnostic application of prognostic and predictive multi-gene expression assays  In clinical\n\npractice  these multi-gene classifiers are currently mostly used for estrogen  ER -positive/\n\nHER2-negative breast cancer  The tests primarily rely on quantification of ER- and prolifera-\n\ntion-related genes and combine these into multivariate prediction models \n\nMammaPrint is one of the first-generation prognostic signatures  It is a micro-array based\n\n70 gene assay  which was launched in 2002 [7]  In validation studies the MammaPrint assay was\n\nshown to successfully predict metastasis free survival and overall survival and it has been sug-\n\ngested that it might be useful to select patients not requiring adjuvant chemotherapy [7 8 9] \n\nThe most recently published results of the large prospective study of the MammaPrint assay\n\n MINDACT  showed that approximately 46% of women with early-stage breast cancer with a\n\nhigh clinico-pathological risk and low genomic risk might not require chemotherapy [10] \n\nEndoPredict is a second generation multigene test launched in 2011 [11]  It is a 12 gene\n\nreverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR  RT-qPCR -based assay  including disease-\n\nrelevant as well as control and reference genes  It selectively targets the group of ER-positive/\n\nHER2-negative breast cancers [11 12 13 14 15 16]  Based on the relative expression of the\n\ngenes-of-interest a 12-gene molecular score  EP score  is calculated  Subsequently tumour size\n\nand lymph node status are taken into account to calculate the clinico-pathological EPclin\n\nscore  the final test result  The EndoPredict test was validated independently in three large ran-\n\ndomized phase III trials with n = 378  ABCSG-6  n = 1324  ABCSG-8  and n = 928  trans-\n\nATAC  patients resulting in a level of evidence of 1 [11 12 13]  In all three validation studies\n\nthe EndoPredict was an independent predictor of distant recurrence  In the same three cohorts\n\nthe EndoPredict test was especially investigated for the prediction of early and late distant\n\nmetastasis and reliably identifies the subgroups of patients with an excellent long-term prog-\n\nnosis after 5 years of only endocrine therapy [17] \n\nThe concordance of the test results of the various gene expression assays on the market is\n\ncurrently studied by several groups [18 19 20 21 22 23]  To the best of our knowledge no group\n\nhas yet compared the MammaPrint and EndoPredict test \n\nMammaPrint versus EndoPredict  Poor correlation in disease recurrence risk classification\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183458 August 29  2017

and methods\nPatient´s characteristics\n48 tissue samples from patients of the Breast Centre Vorarlberg with primary invasive breast\n\ncancer which had been analysed with the multi-gene assay MammaPrint during routine\n\npatient care between 2007 and 2015 were included in the present study  The median age of the\n\npatients was 55 years  The clinico-pathological characteristics of the patients are shown in\n\nTable 1  24 of 48  50%  of the tumours were invasive ductal carcinomas  IDC  23/48  48% \n\ninvasive lobular carcinomas  ILC  and 1 tumour  2 1%  was an invasive ductal carcinoma with\n\nsquamous components  Invasive lobular cancers constitute approximately 15% of all breast\n\ncancers  The number of invasive lobular carcinomas in our cohort is obviously higher than\n\nthat percentage  The decision to conduct the MammaPrint tests  and subsequently the com-\n\nparative EndoPredict tests  was purely based on the clinical needs  To address this bias the\n\nresults of the MammaPrint and EndroPredict test were analyzed both for the whole cohort\n\nand for ILC and IDC separately  60%  29/48  of the patients were node-negative and 40%\n\nTable 1

expression profiling and the EndoPredict test as well  The MammaPrint test can be per-\n\nformed on fresh or freshly frozen breast cancer tissue or FFPE tissue [24]  22 freshly frozen\n\n 46%  and 26 FFPE  54%  tumour samples were analysed  MammaPrint test results had been\n\nconsidered together with other clinical and pathological factors by the interdisciplinary tu-\n\nmour board for clinical

status using\nimmunohistochemistry and dual silver in situ hybridization\nThe assessment of hormone receptors  ER  PR  HER2 and the cellular proliferation marker Ki-\n\n67 was carried out on the assembled tissue microarray representing the areas used for total\n\nRNA isolation for EndoPredict testing  The immunohistochemical staining and the Dual silver\n\nin situ hybridization  SISH  were performed on the Ventana BenchMark ULTRA  Ventana1\n\nMedical Systems Inc  Tucson  USA  using commercial antibodies and DNA probes following\n\nmanufacturers´ recommendations  For the detection of the primary antibodies for ER  PR and\n\nHER2 the BASIC AEC Detection Kit  Ventana1  was used and for Ki-67 the ultraView Uni-\n\nversal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit  Ventana1  The following primary antibody\n\nclones were used  Estrogen receptor  SP1  Ventana1  progesterone receptor  1E2  Ventana1 \n\nHER2  c-erb2  IDLabs  Birmingham  England  and Ki-67  30–9  Ventana1  All procedures\n\nfor the SISH analysis were carried out following the recommended protocol of the manufac-\n\nturer using the INFORM HER2 Dual SISH DNA Probe Cocktail  Ventana1  For the detection\n\nof the HER2 probe the ultraView SISH DNP Detection Kit  Ventana1  and for the CEP17\n\nprobe the ultraView Red ISH DIG Detection Kit were used  respectively  The cut off for positive\n\nER and PR was set to 1% of positive stained nuclei  HER2 immunohistochemistry was scored as\n\ndescribed in the current ASCO guidelines [25]  Ki-67 expression analysis was divided into three\n\ncategories  in which 15% proliferation activity was scored as low proliferation  16–25% as\n\nintermediate and>25% as positive or high proliferation  The used cut-offs were defined in-\n\nhouse  SISH testing was evaluated in reference to the ASCO guidelines  20 tumour cell nuclei\n\nwere assessed and the cut-off for positive HER2 status was set as HER2/CEP17 ratio  2 \n\nMammaPrint test\nUpon the recommendation of the breast cancer tumour board  the samples were sent to the\n\nreference laboratory of Agendia  Agendia  Amsterdam  Netherlands  for MammaPrint testing\n\naccording to their standard operating procedure  SOP  guidelines  For this assay  fresh tissue\n\nas well as FFPE tissue can be used [24]  Sections of fresh tissue containing the largest amount\n\nof invasive tumour cells were chosen by an experienced pathologist  and sent to Agendia labo-\n\nratories according to the recommendations of the company  Concerning FFPE material  one\n\nrepresentative paraffin block was chosen  containing the largest amount of invasive tumour\n\ncells on the corresponding hematoxylin & eosin  H&E  slides  Additionally  10 unstained serial\n\nsections of 5 micrometer thickness per tumour block containing approximately 30% tumour\n\ncells were cut from the paraffin blocks  mounted on glass slides and shipped  The test deter-\n\nmines the expression of 70 candidate genes and hundreds of reference genes which are mea-\n\nsured 6 times each [26]  The multi-gene assay covers the biological motives related to the six\n\nhallmarks of cancer including apoptosis  self-sufficiency in growth

classification to develop distant\n\nmetastasis is developed [8 26 28 29 30] \n\nEndoPredict test\nEndoPredict was performed retrospectively using the same archived paraffin blocks assessed by\n\nMammaPrint previously  For the 22 fresh tissue samples analyzed with MammaPrint  corre-\n\nsponding FFPE tumour blocks were chosen  First  a tissue section was cut from each sample for\n\nH&E staining  the area of invasive tumour cells was identified and marked under the light\n\nmicroscope for tumour cell enrichment and sampling  As recommended by the manufacturer\n\nthe area of the invasive tumour was at least 30% of the whole tissue section [29]  One adjacent\n\nunstained tissue section  thickness of 10μm  was transferred into a 2ml  RNase-free sample tube\nfor total RNA extraction  Total RNA extraction was performed using a manual  silica-coated\n\nmagnetic bead-based method  Versant1 Tissue Preparation Reagent Kit  Siemens Healthcare\n\nDiagnostics GmbH  Erlangen  Germany  following the manufacturer´s recommendations  RNA\n\nwas eluted in 100μl elution buffer  Subsequent quantitative reverse-transcription real-Time PCR\n RT-qPCR  analysis was performed to determine the yield of total RNA and to check for DNA\n\ncontamination  For the determination of the amount of RNA and of residual genomic DNA\n\nqPCR assays for the RNA of the 60S ribosomal protein L37a coding gene  RPL37A  as well as\n\nfor DNA of the β-globin  HBB  gene were used according to manufacturer’s instructions  If\nneeded  an additional DNase digestion was performed to recover genomic DNA-free total RNA \n\nThe multigene assay EndoPredict  Sividon Diagnostics GmbH  Cologne  Germany / Myr-\n\niad Genetics  Zurich  Switzerland  uses the quantitative reverse-transcription

 tumour size and nodal status the EP and\n\nEPclin scores were calculated with the web-based EndoPredict Report Generator  The EP\n\nscore is purely based on the gene-expression data  The EPclin score  the final result of the\n\nEndoPredict test which is used for clinical decision making  considers tumour size and nodal\n\nstatus in addition to the molecular EP score [11]  Using predefined cut off values patients were\n\nclassified by the software into low or high risk of distant metastasis  The cut off value for the\n\nEP score was 5 0 and for the EPclin score 3 32867 [11] \n\nFor all 48 study samples the extraction of a sufficient amount of total RNA and generation\n\nof valid results was possible  Scores and risk groups were generated for each patient and com-\n\npared to the risk

Pearson´s correlation coefficient  r  or Spearman´s rank\ncorrelation coefficient  ρ  using cor test  function  In case of categorical values contingency\ntables were generated  Concordance was then calculated as the number of matching cases\n\ndivided by the total number of observations and evaluated using Cohen´s kappa  κ  calculated\nas\n\nk ¼\npo   pc\n1   pc\n\n \n\nwith po being the

evaluate the observed concordance  For all statistical tests a level of\nsignificance of 95% was applied \n\nResults\nMammaPrint test results\nA valid risk classification by the MammaPrint test was possible in 45 of the 48 cases  94%  In\n\n3 of 48 tumours  6%  the RNA quality was too low for a proper risk assessment  17 of these 45\n\ntumours  38%  were classified as low risk and 28  62%  as high risk  When comparing the\n\ntumour grade with the risk classification we found no statistically significant correlation with\n\nthe MammaPrint test results  p = 0 413  S1 Fig \n\nEndoPredict test results\nThe EndoPredict test provided valid test results for all 48 tumours including an 12-gene molec-\n\nular EP score and EPclin risk score  For statistical analysis 4 of 48  8%  of the patients had to\n\nbe excluded  because their tumours were estrogen receptor negative or HER2 positive and did\n\nnot meet the inclusion criteria of the EndoPredict test  S1 Fig \n\nAccording to the molecular EP score  18%  8/44  of the patients were classified as low risk\n\nand 82%  36/44  of the patients as high risk  The EPclin score re-classified 20%  9/36  EP high\n\nrisk patients into the low risk group resulting in 39%  17/44  of the patients with a low risk\n\nclassification and in 61%  27/44  of the patients with a high risk of disease recurrence  A strong\n\nconcordance of 80% was detected between the EP score and the EPclin score-based risk classi-\n\nfications  κ = 0 522  p = 0 137 × 10−3  This was to be expected since the EPclin score is directly\ndepending on EP score  When

taking only classical clinico-\n\npathological parameters into account  These included tumour size  nodal status  hormone\n\nreceptor and HER2 status and the Ki-67 proliferation index  Sufficient information was avail-\n\nable in 47 patients  Based on these data for 45%  21/47  of the patients an adjuvant chemother-\n\napy would have been the choice of therapy  whereas in 55%  26/47  the clinicians would have\n\nrefrained from chemotherapy recommendation  Fig 3A  Thereafter  the MammaPrint test\n\nresults were included leading to the actual therapeutic strategy chosen for each patient  Mam-\n\nmaPrint results were available for 44 patients and led to a reduction of patients regarded to\n\nneed adjuvant chemotherapy  Thus  only 36%  16/44  of the patients actually received chemo-\n\ntherapy  Fig 3B  In tumour board meetings of the year 2015  all historic patients were pre-\n\nsented again and the MammaPrint test results were replaced by the EndoPredict test results

clinico-pathological factors only result in overtreatment of a sig-\n\nnificant fraction of early breast cancer patients  It has been estimated that approximately 85%\n\nof the patients do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy regarding 10-year breast cancer-\n\nspecific survival [2 3 4 6]  This dilemma led to the introduction of various diagnostic multigene\n\nexpression assays such as MammaPrint  Oncotype DX  Breast Cancer Index  PAM50 and the\n\nEndoPredict test  However  the value of these tests to predict prognosis and individualize adju-\n\nvant chemotherapy is a matter of an ongoing debate and only a few studies have attempted to\n\ncompare these assays in a head to head fashion [18 20 21 22 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39] \n\nTo our knowledge  the present study is the first to compare the first generation test Mam-\n\nmaPrint and the second generation test EndoPredict  We found a discrepant risk classification\n\nin 14 of the 41  34%  directly comparable tumours which would have resulted in a different\n\ntreatment in 38% of our patients  Compared to the MammaPrint the EndoPredict test results\n\nwould have led to significantly higher percentage of patients put on adjuvant chemotherapy\n\n 61% instead of 36%  Our results are provocative and support previous observations that mul-\n\ntigene expression assay are neither easily interchangeable nor comparable [21 22 34] \n\nMammaPrint was one of the first gene expression assays on the market  It is a 70-gene clas-\n\nsifier and was developed to distinguish patients with a high probability of metastasis free sur-\n\nvival from patients with high risk to develop distant metastases within 5 years of diagnosis\n\n[8 30]  The genes analysed are related to various characteristics of cancer cells including self-\n\nsufficiency in growth signals  insensitivity to anti-growth signals  deregulation of apoptosis \n\nlimitless replication  tissue invasion and metastasis  and sustained angiogenesis [26]  The

analysed in various validation studies and proved to be of prognostic value independent of\n\ntumour stage and histopathologic factors such as tumour grade and the Nottingham prognos-\n\ntic index [7 40 41 42 43]  A common observation of these studies was that the MammaPrint\n\nworks better in the prognostication of early recurrences  In a meta-analysis it was also shown\n\nthat the test may also provide predictive information when applying chemotherapy in high\n\nrisk patients [44]  The potential benefit of the MammaPrint test was recently highlighted in the\n\nphase-3 study of 6993 early-stage breast cancer patients  MINDACT  In this comprehensive\n\nstudy it was shown that 46% of women with a high clinical but low genetic risk do not require\n\nchemotherapy  Additionally  it was demonstrated that the 5-year overall survival of patients\n\nwith estrogen-positive  HER2-positive or negative and either node-negative or node-positive\n\nbreast cancer was similar [10]  A re-evaluation of the patients after an extended time period of\n\n10 years will be of great interest \n\nHowever  recently so called second generation assays have entered the market  They\n\naddress the main target group of estrogen receptor positive tumours more specifically and are\n\nthought to predict not only early but also late recurrences within a time frame of 10 years  Fur-\n\nthermore  they do also incorporate classical clinico-pathologic risk factors [22 34]  The first of\n\nthe second generation tests launched is the EndoPredict assay  It was introduced as a novel\n\nmultigene classifier to assess the prognosis in ER+/HER2-negative breast cancer patients  It is\n\na 12 gene expression test including genes related to proliferation and to hormone receptor\n\nactivity [11]  In contrast to the MammaPrint  EndoPredict test is designed to be performed\n\ndecentralized which—by many pathologists—is regarded a major advantage [14]  The robust-\n\nness of the EndoPredict assay in a decentralized test setting using formalin-fixed  paraffin-\n\nembedded tissue  FFPE  was successfully proven in seven European pathology institutions\n\nwith 100% concordance of test results between the different sites [14]  The EndoPredict was\n\nvalidated in three phase III trials involving patients on endocrine therapy only  ABCSG6 \n\nABCSG8  transATAC  and proved to be a significant risk factor classifier for distant disease\n\nrecurrence [12 45]  A remarkable result of these studies was that approximately 50% of the\n\npatients were determined to be “high risk” and would have been subjected to treatment with\n\nchemotherapy  if the molecular EP score would have been taken as the basis for therapeutic\n\ndecision [11 19 23]  A similar  but even more pronounced observation was made in the present\n\nstudy  More than 80% of our patients were classified as high risk by the EP score  This might\n\nreflect a selection bias since a relatively high percentage  50%  of our patients presented with\n\ngrade 3 tumours based on histopathologic grading  However  the final test result of the Endo-\n\nPredict test combines the molecular EP score with tumour size and nodal status  Based on the\n\nresulting EPclin scores  20%  9/36  of our EP high risk patients were re-classified into the low\n\nrisk group resulting in 61%  27/44  of our patients with a high risk of disease recurrence  A\n\nTable 3  Overview of the risk classification of patients with distant metastasis during observation time \nSample ID Metastasis  Months  MammaPrint EP score EP score value

parameters was\n\nmade in the above-mentioned clinical validation trials of EndoPredict  Overall  the percentage\n\nof high risk patients in our patient group seemed to correlate when comparing the EPclin\n\nscore and the MammaPrint  However  of the 24 MammaPrint high risk cases only 18 were\n\nhigh risk by EPclin score resulting in only a weak correlation  75% agreement  Similarly  of\n\nthe 17 MammaPrint low risk cases  only 9 were low risk by EPclin score  53% agreement \n\nThus  discrepancies between the EPclin score and the MammaPrint occurred in more than a\n\nthird of our patients  14 of 41 patients  Based on the purely clinical decision to conduct gene\n\nexpression tests in our cohort the percentage of lobular cancers was higher than expected  In-\n\nterestingly  there was a tendency of a better correlation between the MammaPrint and EPclin\n\ntest result in ILC than in IDC  However  these differences were not statistically significant \n\nThe reason for a higher proportion of EPclin high risk patients in our cohort compared to\n\nmost of the previous reports might be a large proportion of patients with node positive disease\n\n 40%  and/or grade 3 tumours  50%  reflecting a clinically higher risk cohort \n\nA similar correlation of only 75% was described between the EndoPredict test and the\n\nOncotype Dx Recurrence Scores  [20]  The Oncotype Dx is a RT-qPCR based 21-gene assay \n\nincluding 16 genes related to proliferation and 5 housekeeping-genes for normalization\n\n[46 47] \n\nRecently  the EPclin score was directly compared to purely clinico-pathologic risk classifica-\n\ntions and was found to be superior to these classifiers [17]  Furthermore  the EPclin score was\n\nused in a recent decision impact study and led to a change of therapy in 37 7% of patients with\n\n25 4% patients placed on endocrine therapy alone and 12 3% on additional chemotherapy\n\n[19]  Compared to the clinico-pathologic parameters assessed for our study group the applica-\n\ntion of the EPclin score would have placed an additional 15 8% on adjuvant chemotherapy \n\nwhich can be explained by the high risk cohort  40% node positive  50% grade 3 tumours  By\n\ncontrast  the MammaPrint led to a reduction of chemotherapies by 8 3% in our study \n\nDue to the low number of samples  short follow-up data and the low event rate an assess-\n\nment of the diagnostic potential of both gene expression assays was not possible  Only descrip-\n\ntive data analysis was performed  Our study cannot claim which gene expression assay gave\n\nthe more accurate risk assessment but raises the important question if all of the patients\n\nreceived the right treatment  4 patients developed distant metastasis during observation time \n\nEndoPredict identified all of them as high risk while the MammaPrint misclassified one of the\n\nmetastasizing tumours as low risk  In this case chemotherapy was omitted based on clinical\n\nparameters and the MammaPrint test result  In total our study underlines the necessity of fur-\n\nther comparative studies of the currently used gene expression assays \n\nSupporting information\nS1 Table  Statistical evaluation of the

world-\nwide  Chemoresistance has become an important problem in breast cancer\nclinics  The identiﬁcation of new mechanisms affecting chemosensitivity is of\ngreat clinical value for the treatment of breast cancer \nMethods  The expression levels of chemoresistance-associated long non-coding\nRNA  CRALA  a newly discovered long non-coding RNA  were measured by\nquantitative real time-PCR in 79 pre-treatment biopsied primary breast cancer\nsamples  Small interfering RNAs were used to knockdown CRALA expression \nThe effect of CRALA on chemosensitivity was evaluated using cell growth assay \nResults  Non-responding tumors  poor response to chemotherapy  32 samples \nhad fourfold higher CRALA expression than responding tumors  good response\nto chemotherapy  47 samples  CRALA is upregulated in chemoresistant breast\ncancer cell lines compared to their parental lines  Silencing of CRALA in che-\nmoresistant breast cancer cells resensitizes the cells to chemotherapy in vitro \nFurthermore  univariate and multivariate analysis showed that higher CRALA\nexpression was signiﬁcantly associated with poor prognosis in 144 breast cancer\npatients \nConclusion  The study ﬁndings indicate that CRALA expression may be an\nimportant biomarker for predicting the clinical response to chemotherapy and\nprognosis in breast cancer patients  It is possible to target CRALA to reverse che-\nmoresistance in breast cancer patients \n\nIntroduction\n\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in\nwomen and has become the second leading cause of can-\ncer death among women worldwide 1 2Because of the inte-\ngrated application of preventive  early detection  and\nmultimodality treatment  breast cancer outcomes continue\nto improve  Among all of the therapeutic strategies  che-\nmotherapy remains the primary systematic adjuvant\napproach for most women with either human epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor 2  HER2  positive or triple-negative\ndisease  In recent years  large randomized trials and meta-\n\nanalyses have shown that estrogen receptor  ER  positive\npatients also beneﬁt from chemotherapy  Chemotherapy is\neffective in reducing tumor size  inhibiting recurrence and\ndistant metastasis  and therefore  prolonging patient\nsurvival 3–5 Unfortunately  not all breast cancer patients\nare sensitive to chemotherapy  because of the innate or\nacquired chemoresistance induced by continuous drug\napplication  which impedes the clinical cure of breast can-\ncers 6 Thus  identifying patients who are sensitive to che-\nmotherapy is of tremendous clinical signiﬁcance in\nimproving cost-effectiveness and reducing the side effects\nfrom overtreatment \n\n582 Thoracic Cancer 8  2017  582–591 © 2017 The Authors  Thoracic Cancer published by China

account for\n<2% of the total genome DNA  whereas the vast majority\nof genomes can be transcribed into non-coding RNAs 7 8\n\nAmong these are long non-coding RNAs  lncRNAs \nwhich are larger than 200 nucleotides in length but do\nnot encode proteins 9 10 In recent years  it was discovered\nthat lncRNAs serve as pivotal molecules regulating gene\nexpression at epigenetic  transcriptional  and posttran-\nscriptional levels 8 Increasing evidence has indicated that\nlncRNAs play important roles in tumorigenesis and\ntumor progression 10–12 In breast cancer  lncRNAs are\nreported to regulate multiple tumor biological properties\nby diverse mechanisms of actions  NKILA was identiﬁed\nto repress NF-κB signaling and cancer-associated inﬂam-\nmation by inhibiting IκB phosphorylation and p65\nnucleus translocation 13 LncRNA H19 functions as a com-\npeting endogenous RNA to sponge microRNA let-7  lead-\ning to an increase of LIN28 and promoting breast cancer\nstem cell properties 14 Downregulated lncRNA-ROR  also\ncalled lincRNA-ST8SIA3  could inhibit the epithelial–\nmesenchymal transition  EMT  of breast cancer cells and\nenhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen\nby increasing miR-205 expression and suppressing ZEB1/\n2 15 In addition  the dysregulation of lncRNAs has been\nassociated with breast cancer survival and could serve as\na biomarker to predict prognosis  such as NKILA  H19 \nand HOTAIR 13 14 16\n\nPrevious studies have not considered the role of\nlncRNAs in predicting chemotherapy response or serving\nas prognostic factors for chemosensitivity  Liu et al  ana-\nlyzed a dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas  TCGA \nand found that the upregulation of four lncRNAs\n LINC00657  LINC00346  LINC00654  and HCG11  was\nassociated with poor overall survival  OS  while the upre-\ngulation of nine lncRNAs  LINC00705  LINC00310 \nLINC00704  LINC00574  FAM74A3  UMODL1-AS1 \nARRDC1-AS1  HAR1A  and LINC00323  could predict\ntumor recurrence in breast cancer 16 We proposed that at\nleast one of these upregulated lncRNAs might play an\nimportant role in regulating chemotherapy sensitivity in\nbreast cancer patients  In this study  we found LINC00574\nand HAR1A expression was increased in chemoresistant\nbreast cancer cell lines  however  only LINC00574 was\ninvolved in regulating the chemotherapy response of\nbreast cancer cells  data for HAR1A is not shown  There-\nfore  we identiﬁed LINC00574 as a chemoresistance-\nassociated lncRNA  CRALA  Furthermore  we analyzed\nclinical data from our breast cancer center and deter-\nmined that higher CRALA expression was related to poor\npatient response to chemotherapy and shorter survival \nOur ﬁndings provide a helpful marker to distinguish\nwhich patients will respond to chemotherapy in advance \nso that effective treatment strategies can be applied \n\nMethods\n\nPatients and tissue specimens\n\nA total of 176 primary breast cancer patients from Breast\nTumor Center  Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital  Sun Yat-\nsen University  from January 2014 to November 2015 \nwere enrolled in this study  Snap-frozen tissues from core\nneedle biopsy were collected from 79 patients before\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy  Another 97 specimens were\nobtained from core needle biopsy or surgically removed\ntumors  None of the patients had received any therapy\nprior to the biopsy  The Research Ethics Board of Sun\nYat-Sen Memorial Hospital approved this retrospective\nstudy and waived the need for written informed patient\nconsent  The patients tissues and clinical data were anon-\nymized throughout the study \nSeventy-nine patients received neoadjuvant chemother-\n\napy every 21 days according to National Comprehensive\nCancer Network guidelines  The chemotherapy regimen\nconsisted of four 21-day cycles of an epirubicin-\ncyclophosphamide  EC  regimen  epirubicin 100 mg/m2\n\nand cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on day 1  followed by\nfour 21-day cycles of a docetaxel  100 mg/m2 on day 1  or\nepirubicin-cyclophosphamide-docetaxel  ECT  regimen\n epirubicin 100 mg/m2  cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 and\ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1  Whether trastuzumab was\nused or not depended on HER2 status  The patients then\nunderwent mastectomy or conserving breast surgery four\nweeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy  The response to\nchemotherapy was clinically evaluated after every two\ncycles by measuring the change in tumor size according to\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  RECIST 17\n\nRECIST is deﬁned as follows   i  complete response  CR \ndisappearance of all known disease  and reduction of any\npathological lymph nodes in short axis to <10 mm \n ii  partial response  PR  at least a 30% decrease in tumor\nsize   iii  stable disease  SD  a less than 30% decrease or a\nless than 20% increase in tumor size  and  iv  progressive\ndisease  PD  at least a 20% increase and a 5 mm absolute\nincrease in tumor size or the appearance of new lesions  In\nthis study  we classiﬁed SD and PD as non-responders  and\nCR and PR as responders \n\nQuantitative real time-PCR\n\nTotal RNA from tissue samples and

\n\nResults\n\nCRALA is an indicator for predicting\nresponse to chemotherapy in breast cancer\n\nTo evaluate the association between CRALA expression\nand response to chemotherapy in breast cancer  we\ndetected CRALA expression in 79 snap-frozen pretreat-\nment core needle biopsies from primary breast cancer\npatients by quantitative real time-PCR  We then analyzed\nthe association between CRALA levels and chemothera-\npeutic response  Seven patients achieved a CR  40 achieved\na PR  29 exhibited SD  and three showed PD  SD and PD\nwere classiﬁed as non-responders  and CR and PR were\nclassiﬁed as responders  The average level of CRALA\nexpression in the non-responders was 4 09-fold higher\nthan that in responders  P < 0 001   Fig 1a We then con-\nstructed ROC curves to evaluate the average sensitivity and\nspeciﬁcity of CRALA for predicting response to chemo-\ntherapy in breast cancer  The ROC curve analysis showed\nthat CRALA performed well in predicting a response

patients to chemotherapy \n\nCRALA is upregulated in chemoresistant\nbreast cancer cell lines\n\nAs our clinical data indicated that CRALA expression\nlevels correlated with chemotherapy resistance  we further\nexamined the CRALA level in chemotherapy drug resist-\nant cell lines  Similar to the CRALA expression pattern in\nclinical samples  we found its expression was much higher\nin MDA-MB-231P and MDA-MB-231Cis cells than in\ntheir parental cells  8 89-fold and 4 13-fold  respectively\n Fig 2a \n\n584 Thoracic Cancer 8  2017  582–591 © 2017 The Authors  Thoracic Cancer published by China

to\nchemotherapy\n\nWe further investigated whether CRALA upregulation in\nchemoresistant cells contributes to drug resistance  CRALA\nsiRNAs markedly decreased CRALA expression in MDA-\nMB-231P and MDA-MB-231Cis cells  Fig 2b  Without\nexposure to chemotherapeutic drugs  cell proliferation\n Fig 2c  and apoptosis  Fig 2d  in MDA-MB-231P and\nMDA-MB-231Cis cells were not signiﬁcantly altered after\n72 hours of CRALA silencing  suggesting that CRALA dys-\nregulation is not required for chemoresistant cell survival \nHowever  when chemoresistant cells were treated with\n\ncorresponding chemotherapeutic drugs  a decrease in\nCRALA expression obviously slowed down the prolifera-\ntion of MDA-MB-231Cis and MDA-MB-231P cells in a\ntime-dependent manner  Fig 3a  We then treated cells\nwith increasing concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs\nfor 48 hours  and as demonstrated in Figure 3b  MDA-\nMB-231Cis cells were more resistant to cisplatin than\nparental cells  as the concentration response curves of cis-\nplatin shifted to the right  with inhibitory concentration\n IC 50 increasing from 5 63   1 04 μM to 89 22   3 45 μM\n P < 0 001  CRALA silencing with si-1 and si-2 enhanced\nthe suppressive effect of cisplatin on cell proliferation with\ninhibition curves shifting back to the left of MDA-MB-\n231Cis and MDA-MB-231Cis NC cells  and a decreased\nIC50 value from 85 90   1 79 μM to 43 42   1 40 μM\n P < 0 001  and 49 03   3 95 μM  P < 0 001  respectively\n Fig 3b c right \nSimilarly  paclitaxel had less inhibitory effects on MDA-\n\nMB-231P cells than parental cells with IC50 of\n444 46   32 09 nM and 34 32   6 35 nM  P < 0 001 \nrespectively  CRALA Si-1 and CRALA Si-2 signiﬁcantly\nincreased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231P cells to the dif-\nferent concentrations of paclitaxel  with inhibition ratio\n\ncurves shifting to the left of MDA-MB-231P and MDA-MB-\n231P NC cells  The IC50 decreased from 414 65   88 34 nM\n for MDA-MB-231P NC cells  to 241 08   45 71 nM\n P = 0 002  and 237 22   50 92 nM  P = 0 002  respectively\n Fig 3b c left \nThese data indicate that CRALA was upregulated in che-\n\nmoresistant breast cancer cells  and that CRALA silencing\ncould restore chemosensitivity \n\nHigh CRALA expression predicts poor\nprognosis in patients with breast cancer\n\nTo further understand the roles of CRALA in breast can-\ncer  we analyzed the correlation between CRALA expres-\nsion and clinicopathological status of 176 breast cancer\npatients  As shown in Table 1  elevated CRALA expression\nin breast cancer was signiﬁcantly

We analyzed the prognostic value of CRALA\nexpression in these 144 patients and found that breast can-\ncer patients with high CRALA expression exhibited signiﬁ-\ncantly inferior clinical outcomes  P

CRALA\nserves as an independent prognostic factor for PFS in\nbreast cancer patients \n\nDiscussion\n\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in\nwomen and has become the second leading cause of cancer\ndeath in women worldwide 1 At present  chemotherapy is\nthe common treatment strategy and plays an important\nrole in the clinical cure of breast cancer  however  some\n\npatients have a poor response to chemotherapy and their\nprognosis is unfavorable  Chemoresistance has become a\nsigniﬁcant challenge in the clinical setting  therefore  fur-\nther investigation needs to be conducted in order to be able\nto predict the patients who will respond well to chemother-\napy  Such knowledge will assist in optimizing the clinical\ndecision-making process and treatment program to provide\nminimum cost and maximum beneﬁt for breast cancer\npatients \nLncRNAs are non-protein coding transcripts that are\n\nlonger than 200 nucleotides 18 19 Increasing evidence has\nrevealed that LncRNAs may function as oncogenes or\ntumor suppressors and play important roles in regulating\ntumor cell biological properties  including chemoresis-\ntance 20 HOTAIR is upregulated in breast and colorectal\ncancers and hepatocellular carcinoma 21–24 and can report-\nedly regulate the cisplatin-resistant ability of human\nlung adenocarcinoma cells by affecting p21 expression \nthus regulating apoptosis and cell cycle distribution 25\n\nLncRNA H19 has been proven to function as an onco-\ngene 26 H19-induces P-glycoprotein expression and\nMDR1-associated drug resistance in liver cancer cells by\nregulating MDR1 promoter methylation 27 In addition \np95-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cell lines of\nhuman lung carcinoma NCI-H1688 and breast carcinoma\nMCF-7 displayed higher levels of H19 messenger RNA 28\n\nLncRNAs also participate in chemoresistant regulation of\nbreast cancer  For instance  higher PANDA expression\ncontributes to doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer\ncells 26 lncRNA adriamycin-resistance associated  ARA \ninhibition reverses drug resistance in adriamycin-resistant\ncells in breast cancer cell lines by regulating multiple cel-\nlular processes and signaling pathways 6 However  no pre-\nvious research has proposed lncRNAs as a prognostic\nfactor for chemosensitivity \nCRALA is a recently discovered long intergenic non-\n\nprotein coding RNA encoded by a gene at the chromosome\n6q27 region 29 We performed a retrospective analysis based\non patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy to\nevaluate the chemotherapeutic response of CRALA  We\ncollected tumor samples before the patients received any\ntreatment  therefore the predictive value of lncRNA to\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy was independent of other treat-\nment  We found that non-responding tumors expressed\nhigher levels of lncRNA CRALA  and ROC curve analysis\nshowed good sensitivity and speciﬁcity of CRALA to pre-\ndict the response of breast cancer patients to chemother-\napy  We also attempted to analyze the ROC curve for\ntumor size  ER  progesterone receptor  and Ki67 to com-\npare the prognostic accuracy of these variables with\nCRALA  Unfortunately  it was not possible to develop a\ncurve for ER  progesterone receptor  or Ki67  data not\nshown  This may have been a result of treatment selection\n\nTable 1 Correlation between CRALA expression level and

showed that CRALA expression was\nincreased in chemoresistant breast cancer cell lines \nCRALA knockdown resulted reversed chemoresistance  In\naddition  CRALA was expressed at signiﬁcantly higher\nlevels in chemoresistant breast cancer samples than that in\nchemosensitive samples  Moreover  our results showed that\nhigher CRALA expression was signiﬁcantly correlated with\npoor clinical outcomes  assayed by PFS and OS  More\nimportantly  CRALA served as an independent prognostic\nfactor for PFS in breast cancer patients  Our results\nstrongly suggest that CRALA acts as an oncogene to regu-\nlate breast cancer chemosensitivity and may potentially be\nused as a therapeutic target for chemoresistant breast can-\ncer patients \nThere are some shortcomings to our study  First  the\n\nprecise mechanism of how CRALA contributes to che-\nmoresistance is yet to be deﬁned  Second  because only\nin vitro experiments were performed  current CRALA\nresearch is incomplete  Whether CRALA plays a similar\nrole in an in vivo setting is unclear  Third  our clinical\nresults were based on retrospective analysis  and only\n79 breast cancer tissues were sampled for the study  We\nneed to validate our results with a prospective multicenter\nclinical trial  In addition  because of inadequate follow-up\nand the limited sample size  we could not determine an\nassociation between TNM stage  molecular subtype  and\nlymph node status and their impact on OS  We will\naddress these shortcomings in future research \nIn summary  our results suggest that CRALA may\n\nemerge as an important biomarker for predicting the clini-\ncal response to chemotherapy and as an independent prog-\nnostic factor for PFS in breast cancer patients  As a newly\ndiscovered lncRNA  further research is required to explore\nits potential  It is of great clinical value to develop effective\ntherapeutic strategies by targeting CRALA to reverse che-\nmoresistance in breast cancer patients

of\npatients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor of recurrence  which would make\nit possible to provide beneficial personalized treatment  However  no clinically reliable\npredictive factor is currently known  In this study  we investigated the predictive factor of\nrecurrence in TNBC using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spec-\ntrometry for lipid profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients\nwith recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC  respectively  The signal for phosphatidylcholine\n PC   32 1  at m/z 732 5 was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared to the\nnon-recurrence group  P = 0 024  PC  32 1  was more abundant in the cancer epithelial\narea than it was in the surrounding stroma  suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was\nassociated with malignant transformation  Our results indicate PC  32 1  as a candidate pre-\ndictive factor of TNBC recurrence  A future prospective study investigating whether person-\nalized therapy based on PC  32 1  intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC is\nrecommended \n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is one of the leading

after recur-\n\nrence [2]  TNBC is known to be a heterogeneous group of cancer subtypes with variable\n\nprognosis [3]  Identifying the predictive factor of recurrence is required for improving the\n\nprognosis of patients with TNBC by providing an appropriate personalized therapy  Genomic\n\nand proteomic approaches have been generally utilized for investigating possible prognostic\n\nfactors and therapeutic targets  such as BRCA1  TP53  Ki67  epidermal growth factor receptor \nvascular endothelial growth factor  and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  whereas\n\nfew lipidomic approaches have been applied [4] \n\nLipid metabolism plays an important role in cancer progression [5]  Alterations in lipid\n\nmetabolism have been reported in numerous types of cancer including breast cancer [5]  Phos-\n\nphatidylcholine  PC  is the major lipid component of most eukaryotic membranes [6]  PC is\n\nalso a substrate for generating second messengers that play an important role in cell signaling\n\nin cell proliferation  motility  invasion  and differentiation [7]  The fatty acid  FA  composi-\n\ntions of PC in breast cancer and human mammary epithelial cells vary and several enzymes\n\ninvolved in lipid metabolism are overexpressed in breast cancer cells [8]  The difference in the\n\nFA composition of PC in breast cancer cells has been associated with their metastatic potential\n\n[8]  The FA composition of PC in human breast cancer tissue differs from that of non-malig-\n\nnant breast tissue and ductal carcinoma in situ [9]  However  the relationship between the FA\ncomposition of PC in the primary lesions of breast cancer and recurrence is still unknown \n\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  MALDI -imaging mass spectrometry  IMS  is\n\nan efficient tool for profiling lipid composition and visualizing the distribution of lipids in tis-\n\nsue sections while preserving their positional information [10]  MALDI-IMS is a recently\n\ndeveloped technique for simultaneously performing imaging-based morphological observa-\n\ntions and mass spectrometry [10]  In the current study  we investigated a potential predictive\n\nfactor of TNBC recurrence using MALDI-IMS to profile lipids by focusing on the FA compo-\n\nsition of PC in the primary lesion of TNBC \n\nResults\nClinicopathological features\nTable 1

at m/z 184 1  corresponding to phosphocholine  was found as\nthe common product ion in all the result sets [11]  This product ion and the m/z values of the\nprecursor ions strongly suggest that the ions of interest were the protonated PC ions  This is\n\nconsistent with the insight that the ammonium sulfate that is used in this study has the effect\n\nof reducing the generation of alkali metal ion adduct forms but enhances production of pro-\n\ntonated ion forms for PCs  Moreover  the pattern of the protonated PCs  which is known to\n\ncontain highly abundant product ions at m/z 184 1  is also consistent with our result [12] \nAccording to the MS/MS results and a previous report [13]  we identified the ions at m/z\n732 5  706 5  806 5  and 734 5 as protonated PC  32 1  PC  30 0  PC  38

Principal component analysis also shows that PC\n\n 32 1  and PC  30 0  were selected as the peak combination to distinguish the recurrence\n\ngroup from the non-recurrence group  S3 Fig  PC  32 1

poor\n\nprognosis in breast cancer without classification according to intrinsic subtype [14]  As TNBC\n\ncontains higher amounts of PC  32 1  and PC  30 0  compared with estrogen receptor positive\n\nand HER2 type breast cancers [13]  this may indicate a poor prognosis for all TNBC types\n\ncompared to other subtypes  The difference in the FA composition of PC between several\n\nbreast cancer cells and the association with a metastatic potential have also been previously\n\nreported [15]  However  phospholipids and lipid metabolism of cultured cancer cells were\n\nreported to be different from those of solid tumors [16]  In the present study  we used human\n\nbreast cancer tissues obtained from primary lesions only of patients with TNBC  Hence  we\n\npropose a powerful candidate for the predictive factor of recurrence in patients with TNBC \n\nThe prediction of recurrence in patients with TNBC would make it possible to provide benefi-\n\ncial personalized therapy  A future prospective study investigating whether the personalized\n\ntherapy based on PC  32 1  intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC would be\n\nnecessary for factor validation  Moreover  the prediction of recurrence in patients with TNBC\n\nwould make it possible to rapidly initiate treatment for recurrence  followed by an intensive\n\npostsurgical follow-up  A prospective study investigating whether intensive follow-up im-\n\nproves the prognosis of patients with TNBC with a high intensity of PC  32 1  would also be\n\nrequired \n\nPC  32 1  and PC  30 0  were more abundant in the cancer epithelial area compared to the\n\nstroma surrounding cancer in the recurrence group  Fig 2  Therefore  PC  32 1  and PC\n\n 30 0  were considered as abnormal lipid metabolism-generated metabolites that promote can-\n\ncer metastasis  Compared to the PC content in non-malignant tissue  PC  32 1  and PC  30 0 \n\nwere reported to accumulate in breast cancer tissues [9]  The abundance of PC  32 1  in the\n\nrecurrence group is consistent with the results of a previous study on the malignant transfor-\n\nmation of breast cancer  Furthermore  the accumulation of PC  32 1  and PC  30 0  was\n\nreported in invasive breast cancer  compared with non-invasive carcinoma [9]  This previous\n\nreport also indicated that PC  32 1  and PC  30 0  were associated with the malignant transfor-\n\nmation of breast cancer and is in agreement with our results  Ki67 is considered as a cellular\n\nmarker for proliferation and a prognostic factor for breast cancer [4]  Correlation analysis\n\nrevealed negative correlation between the mean value of averaged signal intensity of PC  38 6 \n\nat m/z 806 5 and Ki67  S4 Fig \nPC  32 1  PC  30 0  and PC  38 6  can be assigned as PC  16 0/16 1  PC  16 0/14 0  and\n\nPC  16 0/22 6  according to a previous study  respectively [17]  The ratio of PC  16 0/16 1  to\n\nPC  16 0/22 6  was significantly higher in the recurrence group than it was in the non-recur-\n\nrence group  Fig 1D  which can be explained by an increased level of FA  16 1  in the cancer\n\nepithelial area of the recurrence group  One possible reason why PC  16 0/16 1  containing\n\nFA  16 1  is increased in the recurrence group might be the up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA\n\ndesaturase-1  SCD1  SCD1  which converts saturated FA  SFA  to mono-unsaturated FA\n\n MUFA  has been reported to be up-regulated in breast cancer with abundant PC  16 0/16 1 \n\n[18]  High SCD1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer\n\n[19]  As the inhibition of SCD 1 has been reported to reduce the proliferation and survival of\n\ncancer cells and  therefore  SCD 1may represent a suitable therapeutic target [20]  In the pres-\n\nent study  there were no differences between the two groups regarding PC  34 1  which was\n\nconsidered to contain FA  16 1   S1 and S2 Figs  In vivo phospholipids contain substantially\nmore FA  16 0  FA  18 0  and FA  18 1  than FA  16 1  [21]  PC  34 1  might exist as PC\n\n 16 0/18 1  rather than as PC  16 1/18 0  Therefore  PC  34 1  might not increase in the recur-\n\nrence group even if there were abundant FA  16 1  Immunohistochemical staining of SCD1\n\nwas performed using a modified protocol as previously reported [18]  the detailed method of\n\nSCD1 staining is shown in S1 Methods  Correlation between high PC  32 1  and stearoyl-CoA\n\nRecurrent TNBC tissues contain a higher amount of PC  32 1 \n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0183724 August 23  2017 7 / 13\n\n\n\n\ndesaturase expression was not found  S5 Fig  Although there was no difference between the\n\namount of SCD1 protein of the recurrence group and that of the non-recurrence group  SCD1\n\nmight have been activated more strongly in the recurrence group  As a lipidomic approach\n\nwas applied in this study  we were able to identify a potential factor to predict recurrence in\n\nTNBC  The other possible explanation for the increased PC  16 0/16 1  in the recurrence\n\ngroup might be the up-regulation of lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1  LPCAT1  PC\n\ncan be synthesized by de novo and remodelling pathways [22]  In the remodelling pathway \nLPCAT 1 is a key enzyme for the production of PC from lyso-phosphatidylcholine  LPC  by\n\nre-acylation  and its expression has been reported to increase in breast cancer with shorter sur-\n\nvival rates [23]  Moreover  LPCAT1 is reported to be selective for LPC  16 1  and up-regulated\n\nLPCAT 1 increased PC  16 0/16 1  [24]  High expression levels of SCD1 and LPCAT1 might\n\nincrease PC  16 0/16 1  levels and might be associated with poor prognosis  In the future  PC\n\n 32 1  may serve as a predictive factor of the therapeutic effect of inhibitors of SCD 1 and\n\nLPCAT 1 for treatment of patients with TNBC  further studies on PC profiles and related\n\nenzymes will be required to verify this possibility \n\nThe current study contains two limitations  a low number of sample and a short follow-up\n\nperiod  TNBC includes heterogeneous groups of cancer subtypes  Taking the parent popula-\n\ntion into account  increasing the sample number is an important requirement to determine\n\nwhether PC  32 1  is common to the recurrence of all case of TNBC  The median follow-up\n\nperiod of the patients was two years in the present study  therefore  relapses later than two\n\nyears might not have been included in the present analysis  It is thus necessary to increase the\n\nnumber of samples and follow-up over a longer term in order to validate PC  32 1  as a predic-\n\ntive factor of recurrence in patients with TNBC \n\nIn this study  we identified a candidate predictive factor of TNBC recurrence  Specifically \n\nwe showed that recurrent TNBC contains s significantly higher amount of PC  32 1  that is\n\nassociated with the remodeling pathway in PC metabolism \n\nMethods\nEthics statement\nThe experiments in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hamamatsu Uni-\n\nversity School of Medicine  Written

cancer among women in the\nworld  nearly 1 67 million new cancer cases were diagnosed\n 25% of all cancers  in 2012 [1] Advanced breast cancer  ABC  is\na treatable but still generally incurable disease  most patients are\npostmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive and\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative  HR+\nHER2   ABC  Current goals of therapy are to both optimize\nsurvival time and palliate symptoms to maintain quality of life \nEndocrine therapy was recommended as the preferred ﬁrst-line\ntreatment to achieve these goals because of proven efﬁcacy and\ngenerally favorable tolerability proﬁle [2–4]\n\nTamoxifen  a selective estrogen receptor modulator  was the\nmost widely used ﬁrst-line endocrine therapy for postmenopausal\npatients with HR+ HER2  locally advanced or metastatic breast\ncancer for many years [5] In recent years  third-generation\naromatase inhibitors  AIs  including anastrozole  letrozole  and\nexemestane have largely replaced tamoxifen as ﬁrst-line endo-\n\ntherapy because of greater efﬁcacy and tolerability [6 7]\n\ntrant is an estrogen receptor  ER  downregulator distinct\nfrom other endocrine agents  and

surgical\napproach to the nipple-areola complex  and  ii  to verify the association between malignant\nNDc and nipple malignancy \n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively analyzed a case series of 139 patients with NDc who underwent breast\nsurgery  The clinical and histological findings  types of surgery with emphasis on nipple-are-\nola complex amputation  immunohistochemical phenotypes of the carcinomas and mea-\nsurements of the tumor-nipple distance were recorded  Additionally  in patients who showed\nHER2-positive lesions on definitive surgery  we evaluated the HER2 immunocytochemistry\nof the NDc smears \n\nResults\nThirty-two malignant and 107 benign/borderline NDc diagnoses were identified  All 32 malig-\nnant-NDc cases were histologically confirmed as malignant  Thirty borderline/benign-NDc\ncases were histologically diagnosed as malignant  sensitivity 58%  The majority of the\npatients with malignant NDc were treated with nipple-areola complex amputations in

\n\nOf the 31 patients with NAC amputation  14 had NAC involved by DCIS and/or invasive\n\ncancer  Fig 2A  and 13 of these had a malignant NDc  P 0 014   Fig 2B \nHER2 was overexpressed  score 3+  in 9 cases  All of these were DCIS  Fig 2C  growing\n\nwithin lactiferous ducts of the subareolar region and/or the nipple and showing malignant\n\nNDc  The immunostaining of the corresponding NDc smears demonstrated that the malig-\n\nnant cells overexpressed HER2 as well  Table 4   Fig 2D  In the subset of 17 cases without\n\nNAC involvement  only 1  6%  invasive cancer exhibited HER2 overexpression

central quadrant \n\nIn clinical practice  there is no consensus regarding the surgical approach to patients with\n\nmalignant cells on NDc  However  the data we obtained from a retrospective cohort of patients\n\nrevealed that the majority of cases with malignant NDc underwent NAC amputation irrespec-\n\ntive of the type of surgery performed  i e  mastectomy or conservative surgery  These data\n\nsuggest that malignant NDc diagnosis may influence surgeons in their clinical practice \n\nWe are aware that our case series is small to draw definitive conclusions  however  our find-\n\nings are in line with previous works  showing that in-situ carcinomas are the primary cause of\n\nNAC involvement and that these DCIS frequently overexpress HER2 [28–30  25]  Bauer et al \n[27] showed that

represent a risk\n\nfactor for local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery and that patient may suffer of spon-\n\ntaneous ND [5]  positive at cytology examination  In the present study  we observed that\n\nmicropapillary and papillary DCIS histotype are frequently related to ND  although this associ-\n\nation was not specific of NAC involvement  Table 4 \n\nThe rate of occult NAC involvement reported in patients with invasive BC  is highly vari-\n\nable  from 0% to 27%  [31  32  18  33] and mammographic distance between tumor and nip-\n\nple  axial tumor-NAC distance at

mastectomy [20] consider the distance between the lesion\n\nand the NAC evaluated using imaging analysis as the most important parameter for NAC pres-\n\nervation or amputation  A study on imprint cytological assessment of the subareolar tissue\n\nshowed that it might not be sufficient as an exclusive method for the intraoperative assessment\n\nof the NAC  having the sensitivity of 50% and the specificity of 87 58% [36]  The intraoperative\n\nassessment of NAC by frozen sections is more sensitive  92%  but to obtain reliable results it\n\nis needed to use specific diagnostic protocols [37] \n\nIn addition  we showed for the first time the feasibility of the HER2 immunostaining in air\n\ndried ND pre-stained smears  and observed a very high concordance with the results obtained\n\non the immunostaining performed on histological sections of the corresponding surgical sam-\n\nple  This suggests the possibility to implement this method for studying malignant NDc and to\n\nuse the results as an additional biological parameter for guiding NAC surgery \n\nIn conclusion  we observed that malignant NDc influenced surgical decision in our case\n\nseries and confirmed that malignant NDc is highly specific for the presence of breast cancer \n\nmainly DCIS  Finally  we showed that if NDc is HER2 positive  NAC involvement is more\n\nlikely than in HER2 negative cases

into de novo stage IV breast cancer with lymph node\nmetastasis  Our results indicated that accurate lymph node evaluation for stage IV patients\nis still necessary to obtain important prognostic information \n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide  and 1 68 million cases are\n\nnewly diagnosed annually [1]  Among them  about 6%–10% of women present with de novo\nstage IV breast cancer at diagnosis [2–4]  The median survivals of the disease with distant\n\nmetastasis are ranging between 18 and 24 months [4–6]  Once metastatic disease is diagnosed \n\ntreatment is usually palliative with systemic therapy  This practice is based on prior studies \n\nwhich have shown stage IV breast cancer to be an incurable disease [7–8] \n\nThe combination of primary tumor  T  regional lymph nodes  N  and metastases  M  is\n\nthe cornerstone of the breast cancer staging system of the American Joint Committee on Can-\n\ncer  AJCC  Based on the presence of distant metastasis  all patients are divided into two\n\ngroups—staging M0 and M1 [9]  For M0 patients  lymph node metastasis is an important\n\ndemarcation criterion  which is also regarded as one of the most important prognostic factors\n\nin clinical practice [9–12]  However  M1 patients are all categorized as stage IV regardless of\n\nany N status [9]  Up to date  the clinical value of N descriptors has been neglected in various\n\ncancers of M1 staging  including breast cancer  Recently  Dai et al reported that lymph node\n\ninvolvement is an independent prognostic factor for M1 patients with lung cancer [13] \n\nwhereas the clinical effect of lymph node status on patients with M1 breast cancer has not been\n\nstudied extensively  Thus  the present study aims to identify whether accurate identification of\n\nlymph node status in M1 patients with breast cancer is of clinical value \n\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nThe Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results  SEER  database  2004–2013  was used for\n\nthe study  The National Cancer Institute’s SEER Stat software  Version 8 2 0  was used to\n\nidentify patients  All patients had a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IV breast can-\n\ncer according to the 6th and 7th edition of the AJCC criteria  Patients for whom breast cancer\n\nwas not the first tumor were excluded  Demographics  including age  gender  race and marital\n\nstatus at diagnosis were retrieved  Tumor variables included location of the primary tumor  T\n\nstaging  N staging  histological type  estrogen receptor  ER  status  progesterone receptor  PR \n\nstatus and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  HER2  status  Data of HER2 status is\n\navailable since 2010  Survival data were extracted at 1 mo intervals for a follow-up period\n\nbetween 1 mo and 120 mo \n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were presented as median  range  and percent values  Overall survival and breast\n\ncancer-specific survival  BCSS  were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared\n\nusing the log-rank test for all M1 patients according to N staging  Overall survival was deter-\n\nmined from the SEER record of survival time  total number of months  and vital status  Breast\n\ncancer–specific survival  BCSS  was defined as the interval from diagnosis of M1 disease until\n\nLymph node status and stage IV breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE | https //doi org/10 1371/journal pone 0182953 August 14  2017 2 / 9\n\n\n\n\ndeath due to breast cancer  In addition  multivariate the Cox proportional-hazard regression\n\nmodel was applied to adjust for potential confounders in the survival analysis for all M1\n\npatients  with p-values  65 years  HR = 1 417  95% CI  1 325–1 516  p  0 05  We speculate that the abnormality may be related to the site of metastasis  such as\n\nvisceral metastases  bone metastases and brain metastases  Several studies have reported a\n\nrange of prognostic factors for women with metastatic breast cancer including factors such as\n\nage at diagnosis  ER  PR  HER2 and site of metastases [5 17]  The current study showed that\n\nfor M1 patients  age  race  marital status and primary site were the independent prognostic fac-\n\ntors  Thus  further studies or more clinical data are required to evaluate the impact of the site\n\nLymph node status and stage IV breast cancer\n\nPLOS ONE |

Additionally  several studies\n\nhave reported improvement in survival of women with metastatic breast cancer  such as partial\n\nor total mastectomy [18–19]  Hence  different clinical treatments may have influence on sur-\n\nvival in M1 patients \n\nPrognostic factors combining clinical and laboratory variables with physician’s estimates\n\nhave been developed in recent years [20]  However  in this study  we just selected patients\n\nfrom the SEER database to analyze the prognostic factors  It is necessary for us to include\n\nmore detailed information using our own patient database to verify the results \n\nIn conclusion  accurate lymph node staging is utilized mainly to estimate prognosis  and it\n\nalso contributes to determining treatment strategies  Our results supported that the prognostic\n\nvalue of lymph node staging extends even to M1 patients and indicated that accurate lymph\n\nnode evaluation for M1 patients is still necessary to obtain important prognostic information \n\nSupporting information\nS1 File  Original data of each case from SEER database \n\n XLSX \n\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization  Haochang Yang \n\nData curation  Pei Wang
